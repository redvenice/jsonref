However, it is likely that the proportion of BAME colleagues across Tate Enterprises will remain broadly the same at the end of the process.”They say Tate has given TEL £5m from its reserves to cover losses and ensure the future of the business. “As well as this, Tate Gallery could have expected to receive at least £5m in income from TEL over the course of the year and this will now be lost.”Tate will benefit from a share of the government’s £1.57bn recovery package to help arts and culture in the UK, sectors which are among those hit hardest by the pandemic.PCS has said the figure for Tate is £7m. Despite this, “management is pushing ahead with unnecessary and damaging staff cuts which will greatly hinder the galleries from providing a unique cultural service”.Balshaw said the consultation on job losses had been delayed as long as possible. “We don’t want to lose any staff but we know we have to otherwise the business won’t be able to trade,” she told Lauren Laverne on Desert Island Discs. Staff who lose their jobs would be given the first opportunity to return post-Covid, she added.A joint statement from Hamish Anderson and Carmel Allen, directors of Tate Enterprises, said: “We have worked hard and exhaustively, to model as optimistically as we can for the future and to keep as many jobs as possible.“We regret that, following collective consultation, we will have to make 313 redundancies in Tate Enterprises Ltd. The selection process across these roles will take place over the coming weeks. It is with great sadness that we have been forced by the current circumstances to have to make these decisions. We recognise how difficult this must be for our colleagues and aim to be as supportive as we can while still ensuring the future of the business.”Steven Warwick, PCS culture group secretary, said the cuts were “brutal” and “incredibly disappointing”.He added: “We don’t think any redundancies should be made while executives at Tate are still earning hundreds of thousands of pounds salaries. These cuts will disproportionately affect the lowest paid and the most erse teams across the whole of the Tate estate.” Job losses on an unprecedented scale are looming for galleries, theatres and music venues across the UK despite the government’s financial package.The Southbank Centre in London has announced 400 redundancies. An open letter has called the job cuts brutal and warned that a proposed restructuring will result in “irrevocable damage” to the centre. It has been signed by more than 7,000 people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90350503a56805846013d5a265f1c49498fc5323/0_0_5290_3527/master/5290.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ccbc8e1da12890957513683211f8dca 1400w","title":"black excellence stars of afropunk in pictures","story":"Since 2005, Afropunk has celebrated the music, fashion and beatboxing of black artists – and seen the crowd swell to 70,000.

Middlemarch, originally published in eight parts in 1871-72, has never been released under her real name. Evans said she was “resolute in preserving my incognito, having observed that a nom de plume secures all the advantages without the disagreeables of reputation”, while her partner George Lewes said “the object of anonymity was to get the book judged on its own merits, and not prejudged as the work of a woman, or of a particular woman”.Now the work voted the greatest British novel of all time is finally coming out as Evans’s, as part of the Reclaim Her Name campaign from the Women’s prize for fiction and prize sponsor Baileys, to mark the 25th anniversary of the award.Some of the books, like Middlemarch, are well-known, including A Phantom Lover, a ghost story from Violet Paget, who wrote as Vernon Lee and Indiana, a romance from Amantine Aurore Dupin, the 19th-century author better known as George Sand, who famously scandalised society by wearing male clothing and smoking cigars in public.Others are being brought to the forefront after forgotten decades, such as Keynotes, a collection of feminist short stories from 1893 that includes open discussions of women’s sexuality. The stories were written by Mary Bright, who wrote as George Egerton, in 1893 she would say of them that “I realised that in literature, everything had been better done by man than woman could hope to emulate. There was one small plot left for her to tell the terra incognita of herself, as she knew herself to be, not as man liked to imagine her.”Frances Rollin Whipper published The Life of Martin R Delaney in 1868 under the pseudonym Frank A Rollin. She was the first African American to publish a biography. Fatemeh Farahani published poems in 19th-century Iran as Shahein Farahani. Ann Petry, who wrote as Arnold Petri, was the first African American woman to sell more than 1m copies of a book, and joins the list with Marie of the Cabin Club, her first published short story, from 1939.“When I was asked if my mother’s work could be included within such a worthy collection of books along with other impressive female writers, I was honoured,” said Petry’s daughter, Liz Petry. “I’m incredibly proud of my mother’s work and it excites me that her writing has been introduced to a new audience through this collection. I know she would be thrilled to be a part of this as it’s an incredible conversation starter for such an important cause – my mother always believed in a world with shared humanity and I think this project encapsulates that.”The Reclaim Her Name collection will be available to download as ebooks for free, said Baileys, which hopes the project will give the authors “the visibility and credit they deserve”, as well as encourage “new and important conversations around the continuing challenges women face in publishing and authors’ many reasons for using a pseudonym”. “This was about looking back to the women in whose footsteps we walk – the way that other women did get their work into print or couldn’t get their work into print. It’s just such a joyous idea,” said the novelist Kate Mosse, who founded the Women’s prize 25 years ago, following an all-male Booker prize shortlist.More than 3,000 pseudonymous writers were considered by a team of researchers commissioned by Baileys for inclusion in the collection. “They kept their names hidden for all sorts of different reasons,” said Mosse. “There is that idea of hiding the fact that you’re a woman because it’s not appropriate for women to be out there in the public sphere. But it is not very long ago that Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban for daring to go to school. So there are obviously some women writers who are hiding their identity through fear of persecution, either by male relatives, but equally by the state – they’re writing works that would get them into trouble.”Mosse said the promotion was intended to make sure “that on the shelf, women are visible, because if their identities are hidden, it’s as if women didn’t write any of these books, that the past is an unbroken line of beards and every now and again, you get one woman. This collection is purely celebrating some amazing women of the past who have never quite had their due as women.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d4f92d4770abf7763280b274749fdf578f288c/0_322_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ce331200730643450c53145e71d5131d","title":"uk staff how is your employer introducing a sense of community to a virtual office coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear about how you are staying in touch with colleagues while working remotely due to coronavirusHow are employers helping homeworking colleagues keep in touch with each other?

Visitors disappeared overnight, just as shops and bars were readying for the booming spring and summer months.But on a sweltering Wednesday afternoon, as the UK officially entered the deepest recession since records began, the streets of Bowness-on-Windermere were once again thronging with visitors.“This is like August 2019 busy,” said Jennifer Cormack, 38, the sales director at Windermere Lake Cruises, surveying the crowds of day trippers along the jetty.But its tours could now carry only 500 passengers a day along England’s biggest natural lake, compared with 5,000 before coronavirus, she said. Trade was increasingly busy, but it was “infuriating” they could not sell more seats because of Covid-safe measures.The company put more than 100 members of staff on furlough when lockdown struck, but has taken every one back.Bookings for campsites and self-catering accommodation appear to have surged in this part of the Lake District, where one in five of all properties is on Airbnb. Hotels seem to be taking as many guests as they can. Holidaymakers who would have gone to the continent, or on cruises, are instead flocking to the countryside. Some are spending £400 to hire a small boat for two hours, Cormack said.But foreign visitors, who traditionally have the deepest pockets, are being missed. Visitors from China, Japan, Germany and the US account for a big chunk of the £1.5bn spent in South Lakeland every year, half of all Cumbria’s tourist revenue.“The foreign tourists are good spenders. British tourists have returned nicely but we’re missing the foreign tourists,” said Andrew Clayton, 60, who opened Cooks Corner hardware store 37 years ago. All of his nine staff were furloughed but are back at work. He said it was difficult to say how the business would cope with the revenue missed earlier this year: “We’ve got three months to do well. I’m optimistic.”Some lakeside shops were advertising vacancies on Wednesday. The often-younger seasonal workers who come here each summer, many from mainland Europe, are staying away, perhaps because of safety concerns about travel or accommodation. “There’s not that many people wanting to work,” said Joanna Biernat, 40, the manager of Driftwood restaurant. Biernat was hopeful that the business would survive – “everyone loves our fish and chips” – but said it was not possible to recoup the earnings lost. “We had to spend a lot of money for people to stay safe,” she said, pointing to the screens separating outdoor tables.At Huttons Chocolates, business was “booming”, its joint owner, Kay Forsgardh, 59, said. “Every day now is like a really good Saturday. It’s unprecedented busy.” The family-run chocolatier, which supplies many local hotels, was devastated to have to close on the eve of Easter, traditionally its busiest period.The hundreds of unsold chocolate eggs were melted down to make truffles and the 18-year-old firm is doing well, doubling its staff from two to four. “It’s absolutely tremendous. We’re hiring more staff because I think this will be the trend – people are nervous to get on planes,” Forsgardh said.Meanwhile, in Crawley town centre, West Sussex, a sweltering August day had drawn plenty of visitors.Couples and families in summery outfits browsed the shops on the pedestrianised high streets, many carrying shopping bags, or sat drinking ice coffees under parasols outside coffee shops on Queens Square.However trade was slow at Mick and Mandy Mooney’s household goods stall. One of only a couple of vendors at the market, they blamed both the heat – and the economy – for deterring shoppers and their fellow traders. On the day official figures showed Britain had plunged into its deepest recession since records began, the Mooneys declared trade “dire”.Demand for their goods, including pillows, artificial flowers and face masks, was initially “as good as Christmas, better than we expected” when lockdown restrictions were lifted, said Mandy, but had slowed in recent weeks.The couple, who travel to Crawley twice weekly to sell at the market, have already noticed a change in customers’ behaviour in the town, located in the shadow of Gatwick airport, where many jobs depend on the beleaguered aviation industry.“They are definitely starting to buy only what they need, not what they fancy,” said Mandy, while Mick added: “They used to buy on impulse, buy something they might need and put it in the shed. Now they’ve got to need it.”More than half of the 94,00 jobs in the area could be lost, according to a report from the Centre for Cities thinktank, because of the town’s reliance on aviation, even although average wages in Crawley were relatively high, and unemployment low, before Covid-19.Many local people, such as Gordon Beesley, 45, a freelance IT consultant, have personal experience of the aviation sector – he and his wife worked at Virgin Atlantic. Beesley, who had cycled into town with his teenage son Tom, 15, has begun to look for a new work contract but said the consultancy industry was “the quietest I have ever known it to be”.Also in Crawley town centre were four trainee pilots on their lunch break from flight school, hard to miss in their uniform of white shirts with epaulettes and black trousers. Joe Taylor, Scott McCauley, Freddie Watts and Johnathon Dorward will finish their training in early 2022, by which point they hope the aviation industry will be recruiting again, allowing them to begin repaying the £100,000 cost of their two-year course.“Every time something happens, like the last recession, or 911, the industry comes back bigger than it was,” said Taylor, 20.Ryan Barnes, sitting on a bench on Queens Square, was waiting for his afternoon shift at Primark in the town’s shopping centre, and was relieved to be back at work after three months on furlough. “Lots of people work at the airport, makes you think whether your job is safe, as it’s a stressful time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c98212bc5f873a3d7f4e8d46416360de17a8da3f/748_158_1855_1113/master/1855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4601a2d1af6ac921f02e4b6c0acd5c34","title":"office pods may be the answer to working safely post covid 19","story":"Entrepreneur Xu Weiping is building 3-metre square workspaces with a chair, desk, fridge, microwave and fold-down bed, in east LondonWelcome to cube city. Xu Weiping, a Chinese multimillionaire, has a vision for the future of office work in the post-Covid-19 pandemic world: thousands of office pods where each person works in their own self-contained 3m x 3m cube.Xu reckons the coronavirus pandemic will have such a fundamental impact on the way people work that he is converting 20 newly constructed office buildings in east London into 2,000 of the inidual cube offices.If the cubes, which feature a kettle, fridge, microwave, videoscreen and fold-down bed as well as a chair and desk, prove popular Xu plans to convert all of his £1.7bn 35-acre regeneration project in east London into more than 10,000 of the inidual cubes.Xu’s Advanced Business Parks (ABP) company had spent years negotiating a deal to redevelop the Royal Albert Docks, which overlooks London City airport in Docklands. The development was finally approved in 2015 by the then prime minister, David Cameron, and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who toasted the deal at a lavish ceremony at Mansion House.The project was, Xu said, very popular, with potential tenants agreeing to rent more than half the 21 buildings constructed in the first phase of the development. But then the coronavirus struck, and just one tenant – automation technology firm Advantech UK – has moved in.The pandemic is the latest in a long list of setbacks for the Royal Albert Docks project, which has also been hit by Brexit, delays to the Crossrail transport project (which will have a station at the nearby ExCel Centre) and worsening Sino-British relations.Xu said he has spent every day since the pandemic struck thinking of ways to secure the future of the development. “I realised that we might have to be prepared for the fact that the virus might stay with us for a long time,” Xu said in translated interview over Zoom. “We will have to create an environment where we can work safely and reduce exposure to public transport and increase happiness in working.”His answer is the inidual office, where colleagues and freelancers can work close to one another but mostly safely self-contained in their own pods. “We believe this is the first of its kind in the UK or even the whole world,” Xu said. “It will completely change the office environment.”Xu said the cubes are designed to combine the best parts of working from home with the amenities and collaboration of a traditional office. “The cube is an inidual space enjoyed by just one person,” he said. “Inside this cube, the person can do their work but also have a rest and relax. The cube is equipped with a multifunctional wall, including a coffee maker, a mini fridge and a day bed, which can all be hidden away when working.”“We will be targeting customers who are reluctant to return to their normal office environment,” Xu said. “Even though the government is calling for workers to go back to the office, people aren’t going. We all want an inidual space. This will be an inidual space that incorporates the benefits of home working.”Anna Codrea-Rado, co-presenter of popular careers podcast Is This Working?, said inidual office pods like those proposed by Xu could be key to helping large numbers of people be more productive after months of struggling to work from chaotic households.“It might actually be what happens in the future,” Codrea-Rado said. “People are worried about busy offices and aren’t interested in co-working spaces because of virus safety.“At the same time it is really challenging when people are living with housemates and everyone is trying to work from home, so there really might be scope for this. But I don’t know how realistic it is that people would be able to pay that much for it.”Xu reckons it will be years before office working returns to the way it was before the pandemic. A danger Xu reckons many people are overlooking is lifts. “Office buildings are generally many levels high and we use lifts to get up them,” he said. “Lifts are very confined spaces that a lot of people share and are often more densely packed than the tube.” His offices, which are six or seven storeys, will have wide staircases.Xu’s cubes, which are being created by east London design company Egg Limited, will be connected to a hub of shared amenities including printers, scanners, kitchens, restaurants, laundry rooms and multimedia broadcasting suites. He also promises a team of lawyers and accountants on site that freelancers or small businesses can turn to for advice.Each floor of 18 cubes will also feature showers. Xu said these extra facilities will encourage workers to spend longer on site, thereby reducing the use of public transport and exposure to the virus.When asked whether workers might end up spending the night in the cube, Xu says it will be actively encouraged. “The facilities will be so good that they can support our workers if they need to work on an overnight project,” he says. “I will be taking a cube myself and spending some nights there to avoid the commute.“The working environment in most traditional offices is quite boring, and very few are human-centred,” said Xu, who has been living in north London since the virus struck the UK in March. “After eight hours people want to leave and go to the pub or a park. With our office people want to stay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68438a5f6401d97ffbb6184fd9167563a27a88ce/0_501_3905_2343/master/3905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c2902a74e30c1ac3af1543f2acd905","title":"president kamala harris in 2024 this might be joe bidens thinking","story":"Such is the scale of rebuilding the US after Trump and Covid, Biden might already be futureproofing the DemocratsJoe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his Democratic vice-presidential running mate in November’s American election is by turns audacious and cautious, radical and conservative, historic and same-old. Nevertheless, although there were several other qualified candidates for the role, Harris is likely to prove a smart choice.You can see this, in a brief and minor way, by the tsunami of abuse and contempt from Donald Trump and his supporters that didn’t materialise after the announcement on Wednesday. With next week’s mainly virtual Democratic convention in Milwaukee days away, the vice-presidential pick was always going to open a window of opportunity for Trump to get into the Biden henhouse and make trouble. That hasn’t happened yet – though doubtless he will try. But it suggests Harris was not the pick Trump had been hoping for.Even on day one, the choice reminds us that Biden is very serious about winning the election. But the radical and historic aspects of Harris’s place on the ticket cannot be passed over as mere add-ons. Biden announced months ago that he would choose a female running mate. But Harris will still be only the fourth woman on a major party ticket in US history following Geraldine Ferraro, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton. Her three female predecessors were all defeated. If she is elected, Harris would prove once and for all that women can win. The choice suggests that Biden, the lifelong Washington pragmatist, recognises the power of female voters to his party and that men are ready to help elect a woman too.But Biden has also chosen the first woman of colour on a major party presidential ticket. That’s hardly a minor milestone in US history, as recent events underscore. Nor was it a foregone conclusion. There were qualified alternatives available, including Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.But a summer dominated by the aftermath of the George Floyd killing and the Black Lives Matter movement would have been a catastrophically bad moment to pick another white candidate. Biden also came under a lot of pressure at the business end of the process to choose a black woman. It was a timely reminder of something he knows better than anyone – namely, how much his own nomination owes to black voters, who brought his campaign back from the dead in February’s South Carolina primary. Once again, the pragmatist has revealed an openness to new ways that some might have thought beyond him.This openness has also extended to the policy process that has been undertaken in the wake of the fight for the nomination. Since May, Biden’s team has been working in six policy task forces on the economy, healthcare, immigration, criminal justice, climate and education. Each is co-chaired by a Biden supporter and a former Bernie Sanders backer. The climate group, for example, is co-chaired by John Kerry and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The process seems to speak to two things: the influence of significant parts of the pro-Sanders left within the party, and Biden’s readiness to engage with it in ways that Hillary Clinton, for example, did not in 2016.Nevertheless, the Harris pick also shows some of the limits of Biden’s embrace of new movements. Harris has often been charged with being too pro-police in police shooting cases as district attorney in San Francisco then attorney general in California, though supporters say she has shifted her view in recent years. Critics also charge her with being light on policy. Yet that was not true when she was San Francisco district attorney and began a programme of alternatives to custody for drug offenders. If she were to spearhead something similar from the vice-presidential office two decades later, it could help to transform America’s catastrophic and destructive incarceration obsession.It is easy to exaggerate the importance of a vice-presidential pick. It’s the presidential candidate who wins or loses the contest. Biden certainly didn’t need to put Harris on the ticket in order to carry California. But the vice-presidency itself is too easily dismissed. Franklin Roosevelt’s first vice-president’s memorable comparison of the job is still often quoted. Yet, in spite of Mike Pence’s performance since 2017, some recent vice-presidents have been significant, both politically and as executives. George HW Bush, Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden himself have been substantial vice-presidential players in ways that Dan Quayle, for example, was not.Harris is in the substantial category for the overwhelming reason that it is possible to imagine her as president. That’s partly because, post-Trump and post-Covid, there would be substantial work for all hands in the new administration. But the main reason is Biden’s age. He will be 78 in November. It has been hinted, though not definitely stated, that he might serve only a single term. He has referred to himself as a transitional figure in the party, paving the way for a new generation. Either way, Harris has now become overnight the presumptive next Democratic presidential nominee after Biden. That gives her a lot of power. For the next generation of Democrats, it is suddenly important to get close to her, and to take what she says seriously.Trump and Covid mean that American government in the 2020s will not be steered by the compass of the past. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that only one part of the Democratic party understands this. Biden’s choice of Harris, like his approach to the Sanders wing over policy, is part of an effort to unify a very ided party to defeat Trump and measure up to the issues facing America and the world.There are more grounds for thinking this unity may happen than either some Bernie-or-bust revolutionaries or identity politics movements care to admit. An Obama-type centrist like Harris isn’t the worst thing in the world to be when running against Trump. Now, though, there is the mother of all election battles to win, whose outcome remains deeply uncertain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c214044ac3910a8d6dabf5c0c234fce7c828bd/0_83_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=432be38e63b9adf7d3ecd7882263170c","title":"parents how are you feeling about a level results day","story":"We want to hear from parents and young people on their thoughts and concerns ahead of A-level results dayIf you are a parent of children who are expecting their results on Thursday, we would like to hear from you.

One able student hoping to go to Durham University had been downgraded in all three of his subjects, with one of his subjects downgraded by two grades.No 10 remains nervous that England will see a replay of the widespread protests in Scotland last week, which led to the Scottish government scrapping grades allocated by a statistical model similar to that used in England, and replacing them with grades assessed by teachers.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, sought to placate pupils and their families last night by saying he was “incredibly sorry” for the disruption to their education during the coronavirus outbreak. “I apologise to every single child right across the country for the disruption that they’ve had to suffer,” Williamson said.However, defending the approach the government has used to standardise results, he told the BBC: “We’ve got a system that is, I believe, the fairest that we can do but let’s not forget that we’ve been in a global pandemic – we’ve been in a situation – none of us would have expected to be in.”But Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, condemned the government’s last-minute announcement of a new appeals process involving mock exam grades as “complete fiasco”.“It was obvious that this was going to be difficult but it’s been weeks or months in the coming. To have an 11th-hour decision that’s caused widespread chaos amongst teachers I have been speaking to, families and young people – it smacks of incompetence,” Starmer said.School leaders on Wednesday received their first look at the A-levels being allocated to their pupils by Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, with one saying there was “anger, dismay, disbelief” among heads.He said he felt “shock, anger, dismay, disbelief” after seeing the results awarded by Ofqual’s algorithm. “We seem to have the worst results we’ve had in the last three years. I’m pretty cut up. I feel like I’ve let them down. I don’t know what else we could have done. We followed all the guidance. We did everything they said. We didn’t inflate grades,” Gill said.Gill predicted that Williamson’s decision on Tuesday night to allow mock exam results as a grounds for appeal would cause further uncertainty. “I think it’s a total farce. How do you standardise that? The one thing I wish is that before all these knee-jerk announcements, they’d just spoken to us. We could have come up with a sensible plan,” he said.Barton, whose union represents the majority of secondary school heads, said: “I think we are going to see major turbulence tomorrow. There’s some really big shocks out there. At the end of the day, headteachers do not give a stuff about algorithms. They are concerned about kids who should be getting an A and they find they are getting a C, and will not get their place at university.”Barton stopped short of calling for the reinstatement of teacher-assessed grades, as in Scotland, but said the mood was changing among headteachers devastated by their results, who now saw the Scottish decision as less outlandish. “There are some big schools with good track records who are seeing some pretty dire results and they are feeling in despair about it. Heads are saying to me, I don’t think I’ve ever felt so powerless, saddened and frustrated,” he said.The pressure on Williamson and the government in Westminster increased after Wales announced that it was putting a floor under every student’s A-level grades to avoid downgrades.Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, said: “I am giving a guarantee that a learner’s final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade. If a student receives a final grade tomorrow that is below that of their previous AS grade, then a revised grade will be issued automatically.”Wales has retained a modular format for its A-level courses, including AS-level exams for the first year of sixth form. In England, AS-levels were decoupled from A-levels by Michael Gove when he was education secretary.Ofqual broke its silence yesterday to defend its system of awarding grades using a school’s previous results and each pupil’s prior attainments, but warned that grades had been lowered to ensure a “level playing field”. “Adjustments were only made where necessary to bring consistency to the standards between schools and colleges,” it said in a statement.The regulator confirmed that it was “working urgently to operationalise” the new appeal route using mock exam grades, but said said further details would have to wait until next week, leaving today’s A-level recipients in limbo.The Department for Education has been reassuring MPs that England would not see a repeat of the embarrassing U-turn in Scotland. But one Tory MP said the DfE should have taken action earlier: “The risk is that kids are going to have their careers ruined, and they’re going to feel that the education system has let them down, and their life chances have been reduced to roulette.”Another Conservative MP, David Simmonds, who sits on the education select committee, said: “The algorithm that’s being used for England’s exam grades is different from the Scottish one so we would expect it to produce different results. The testing that has been done on it suggests it wouldn’t throw up the kind of inconsistencies the Scottish system did, so I’m broadly supportive of it.“But I have a very strong view that I do want there to be a proper appeals process for pupils that’s properly resourced. There’s a big issue for young people, particularly those in disadvantaged groups, where their engagement with the school might not be that good. What happens to them if the school doesn’t wish to take up their case?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e518cae214f13b40680b1f5b2ed06c653f295f/0_577_8660_5196/master/8660.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=962c1c88ff838a9091ef8f0cc0ec7dbb","title":"a taste of honey how bees mend fences between farmers and elephants aoe","story":"A pioneering method from Africa that protects farms from forest herds is now paying off in India, with more profit and less conflictWatchtowers in trees, tripwire alarms, radio collars, chilli smoke and beehive fences: scientists and conservationists across Asia and Africa are coming up with safe and humane ways to keep elephants at bay and reduce conflict with humans.But with the rapid shrinking and fragmentation of their habitats and travel corridors, elephants are increasingly being forced out of the forest in search of food. This puts them in direct conflict with humans. Between 2014 and 2019, 2,361 humans were killed as a result of conflict with elephants, while 510 elephants were killed by electrocution, train accidents, poaching and poisoning.While crop losses are eligible for compensation in India, the claims process can be slow and tedious, so some farmers use fruit and other foods laced with poison or stuffed with firecrackers, and high-voltage electric fences to keep elephants away.Prachi Mehta, research director at the Wildlife Research and Conservation Society (WRCS), has been testing low-cost and safe deterrents in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka state in south India since 2009. The district, with an area of about 4,000 square miles (10,300 sq km) and rapidly depleting forest cover, is home to 70-80 elephants, but there have been no casualties related to human-elephant conflict since WRCS began working with more than 700 farmers in the surrounding villages.There is, however, no easy fix to the problem. “Every human-elephant conflict situation is different,” says Mehta. “There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution. We study the circumstances first and find a site-specific solution.“Elephants, being highly intelligent animals, get habituated to the deterrents over time, requiring us to rotate measures or invent new ones. Our aim is to provide farmers with an array of simple, inexpensive deterrents to protect their crops. Solutions also need to be community-wide to be effective. It is pointless if the elephant is dissuaded from entering one farm and then goes and raids the next farm. So we encourage the entire village to participate in crop guarding.”Multiple factors determine the effectiveness of a particular method, including the time of year and location of the farm. Chilli smoke and other fire-based deterrents, which work well during the dry months, are not viable during the monsoon.Mehta adds: “Elephants prefer to raid farms which are unguarded. So human presence is the main deterrent. In most cases, night guarding from a tree watchtower, coupled with a low-cost, early-warning system – a trip alarm consisting of a modified doorbell tied across possible entry points with nylon ropes – works well to keep the elephants at bay.”For farmers living close to an evergreen forest, there is another lucrative deterrent – a beehive fence.Beehive fences were first successfully trialled and implemented in Kenya by Lucy King of the Elephants and Bees Project, where it was found that the fences could exploit the African elephant’s natural fear of bees. Inspired by a meeting with King at a conference, Mehta decided to try out the fences in Uttara Kannada. Farmers in the district have traditionally practised apiculture, so they were already comfortable handling hives. But there were concerns about the effectiveness of bee fences in India as Asian bee species are less aggressive than African bees.They need not have worried. WRCS’s programme officer in Uttara Kannada, Ravi Yellapur, says 367 farmers in the district now have beehive fences. “Since I joined the project in 2015, there hasn’t been a single instance of an elephant breaching a bee fence to gain entry,” he adds.The locally made fences consist of eight to 10 hollow logs, about a foot in length and with a wide cavity, which are hung between two wooden poles at intervals of 10 metres. The logs are connected to each other by strong wires. The inside of each log is coated with a liquid mixture of beeswax, cinnamon and jaggery (a local, unrefined sugar). Both ends of the log are plugged, except for one or two small holes that allow the Apis cerena bees in Uttara Kannada to enter. The bees are drawn to the logs by the smell of the mixture. Being natural pollinators, the bees help increase the farmer’s crop yield while the honey harvested twice a year provides additional income. About 4kg of “elephant-friendly” honey is taken from one hive per harvest, and the farmer can sell it for 300 rupees (£3) a kilo. This financial incentive, coupled with the regular awareness sessions conducted by WRCS and the local forest department, has helped build a tolerance to elephants among the community.In other parts of India, a more hi-tech solution has been implemented. Elephants, once locally extinct in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, began to make an appearance about 30 years ago, after being displaced from their home ranges in neighbouring states. More recently, a 19-member herd began raiding crops in the Mahasamund district of the state. So, in 2017, the Chhattisgarh Forest Department invited conservation non-profit Wildlife SOS to develop a conflict mitigation plan. The organisation proposed an early warning system based on putting a radio collar on the matriarch of the herd, which was implemented in 2018. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS, says: “Signals from the collar alert the Wildlife SOS team, who inform the forest department about the movement of the matriarch, and therefore the herd. If there is potential for conflict, the forest officials inform the village heads via WhatsApp. Radio announcements are also made. This early warning is critical for the villagers to be prepared when the herd approaches.” The villagers then use the acrid smoke from chillis and other tactics to ert the herd.Key to the success of all these methods is changing the attitude of local communities towards elephants. Yellapur says: “Farmers who were once angry about the presence of elephants now think of them as their friends.”Given the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests and other wildlife habitats, Mahesh Rangarajan, chairman of the Elephant Task Force, which reported in 2010 on recommendations to safeguard the future of elephants in India, says: “We focus on human-elephant conflict but in reality, elephants are symbolic of all wildlife. We must learn to cohabit with every kind of wildlife.“To reduce conflict in the long-term, we need holistic solutions that include protecting wildlife habitats and landscapes, while ensuring human livelihoods and dignity are protected as well.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67160b9d5d9c08a452037a582f153d6becde793/0_241_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d155bc3f84dd55af18110b75e934f5e5","title":"large blue butterfly flutters in cotswolds for first time in 150 years","story":"Painstaking conservation effort to accommodate insect’s complex lifecycle pays offThe biggest reintroduction to date of the large blue has led to the rare butterfly flying on a Cotswold hillside where it has not been seen for 150 years.About 750 butterflies emerged on to Rodborough Common in Gloucestershire this summer after 1,100 larvae were released last autumn following five years of innovative grassland management to create optimum habitat.The globally endangered butterfly now flies in greater number in Britain than anywhere else in the world, four decades after it became extinct in the country.Its return to Britain is arguably the most successful insect reintroduction project worldwide, after caterpillars were initially brought from Sweden in an ecologist’s camper van.Years of painstaking work by Prof Jeremy Thomas and David Simcox led to the butterfly being successfully reintroduced to sites in Somerset and more recently Gloucestershire.To do so, they first had to understand its unique lifecycle, with tiny caterpillars dropping off wild thyme and being taken underground by the red ant, Myrmica sabuleti, which is duped into believing that the parasitic larva is one of their own.The ants carry it into their nests to protect the caterpillar, even “singing” to it, before it turns from herbivore into carnivore and feasts on ant grubs through the winter until it is ready to pupate. The butterfly emerges from underground the following summer.The common, which is owned by the National Trust, first required temporary grazing areas for cattle on steep slopes – where they wouldn’t usually choose to go – alongside the removal of scrub, to create ideal conditions for the red ant.Simcox, a research ecologist and the co-author of the commons management plan, said: “The butterfly needs high densities of the heat-loving red ant … which has a crucial role to play in the lifecycle of the butterfly.“The grazing cows create the ideal conditions for them by keeping the grass down so sunlight can reach the soil which gently warms it, creating perfect conditions for the ants, which are cold-blooded and therefore need warmth in order to actively scout for food throughout the spring, summer and autumn.”The reintroduction was a partnership involving the National Trust, Butterfly Conservation, the Back from the Brink project and others. As the climate warms, the large blue should be able to spread northwards, but only if helped to find new habitat.Richard Evans, a ranger for Rodborough and Minchinhampton commons, said: “Butterflies are such sensitive creatures, and with the large blue’s particular requirements they are real barometers for what is happening with our environment and the changing climate.“Creating the right conditions for this globally endangered butterfly to not only survive but to hopefully thrive has been the culmination of many years work. None of this would have been possible without the combined efforts of conservationists and the local graziers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3a993cf0bfd6ee07601f184b83fc3183d215c3/0_17_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b579194f69fcad031144307f75d8dc","title":"the new taboo how flattering became fashions ultimate f word","story":"Every season comes with an ostensibly complimentary shorthand. But the one that has outlived them all is probably the most problematic‘I’ve got loads of dresses that I bought because someone in the changing room told me they were flattering,” says Billie Bhatia, the fashion features editor at Stylist magazine. “In that moment, I feel lifted. My insecurities about my body are erased.” But Bhatia, 30, has been having second thoughts about the word. “Occasionally, it means a great colour that makes your skin glow, but most of the time ‘flattering’ is just a byword for ‘slimming’,” she says. “If someone delivered the same compliment, but substituted the word ‘slimming’ for ‘flattering’, would you think that was an OK way to talk to a woman? No, right? Everyone likes to hear a compliment. But ‘flattering’ is a dangerous word.”In 2017, the perfect pair of jeans was “on-trend”. In 2018, it was “fierce” last year it was “extra”. Right now, it is “dripping”. In fashion, every season comes with a new shorthand. But one compliment – “flattering” – has outlived them all, selling more jeans, more party dresses and more swimsuits than any other word. “Flattering” is fashion clickbait, an add-to-basket dog whistle.But for generation Z – roughly speaking, those born between 1995 and 2010 – “flattering” is becoming a new F-word. To compliment a woman on her “flattering” dress is passive-aggressive body-policing, sneaked into our consciousness in a Trojan horse of sisterly helpfulness. It is a euphemism for fat-shaming, a sniper attack slyly targeting our hidden vulnerabilities. “Flattering”, in other words, is cancelled.The British model Charli Howard, 29, has been a force for change in the fashion industry since 2015, when an angry Facebook post she wrote about her then agency saying she was too big – she was a UK size 1012 – went viral. “The issue with the word ‘flattering’,” says Howard, now an activist for model ersity and healthy body-image, “is that we instantly associate it with looking thin and therefore looking ‘better’. It suggests your tummy looks flatter or that your waist looks smaller. I find it’s a phrase older generations use. Girls I speak to from generation Z tend not to use it. Those girls see a ersity on social media that older generations didn’t. Celebrating your flaws is considered cool these days.”“The teen magazines that I grew up with never went an issue without a ‘how to fix your body issues’ article,” says Emma Davidson, 33, the fashion features editor at Dazed Digital. “It was either about how to look slimmer or about ‘adding curves to a boyish body’. The message was that whatever you looked like, it wasn’t good enough.” Until recently, Davidson says, “there were lots of things I didn’t wear because I thought I was ‘too big’. In the last few years, I’ve begun to accept and celebrate myself. The word ‘flattering’ is part of how fashion tells women that they are taking up too much space in the world. That’s just wrong on so many levels.”It would be cheering to report that the word “flattering” is therefore being retired from active duty, phased out as society casts aside the cult of skinniness and learns to celebrate beauty in erse shapes and sizes. The truth, sadly, is rather more complicated. With a few honourable exceptions – Eckhaus Latta’s all-sizes casting at New York fashion week, Vogue covers for plus-size models Ashley Graham and Paloma Elsesser – fashion’s bodily ideal remains stubbornly narrow. The pantheon of supermodels has yet to admit any woman over a size 8. Kendall Jenner, Kaia Gerber and Bella Hadid, the most high-profile models of the moment, are as thin as or thinner than any era of cover girls before them. Every designer, every fashion retailer and every changing-room assistant will tell you that women always start with shape when shopping for clothes. “Flattering” is very much alive, and selling clothes.What’s more, some women are protective of “flattering” as a practical shopping aid, a friendly word rather than a toxic one. “Flattering” can describe clothes that feel like they have been made with the real female body in mind, rather than clothes that have been conceived to promote an abstract concept of design, or a trend. Clothes that have been designed in sympathy and solidarity with a woman in search of her best self. Those floaty, tiered midi-length dresses that have become a modern summer classic, in the tradition of Zara’s polka-dot number last year, are loved for being easy to wear, comfortable and confidence-boosting. They are not necessarily slimming, but they are often described as flattering.At the British label Me+Em, Clare Hornby, 51, and her female-led design team are proud to give their customers flattering clothes. “We listen to our customers first and then create a functional yet chic offering that speaks to their needs, rather than us telling them what they should be wearing simply because it’s ‘on-trend’,” says Hornby. “A perfect example is our zip-front necklines: a lot of customers with larger bust sizes commented that they avoided button-up designs, so we came up with an alternative that means you can choose your own neckline – catering to lots of different shapes – but that also adds a contemporary, sports-luxe feel that speaks to our aesthetic. Turn-up cuffs on trousers and jackets, adjustable draw-cord waists, removable belts – all these intelligent design details are important, because there is no one cookie-cutter body shape.”With inclusive sizing, “nude” shades across a broad spectrum of skin tones and erse model casting, the modern underwear brand Heist represents fashion pivoting to the language of a new generation of consumer. Heist avoids using “flattering” as a selling point, “because we strive to be empathic,” says its chief operating officer Natasja Giezen-Smith. Instead, the website is peppered with words such as “confidence”, “comfort”, “happiness” and “support”.The disquiet around the word “flattering” isn’t about pretending our body hang-ups have gone away, but about a rising consciousness of where those hang-ups come from. “Insecurities don’t just go away overnight,” says Davidson. “I have had a lot of unlearning to do.”The activist Kellie Brown, creator of the #FatatFashionWeek hashtag, has talked about body positivity as a “self-love journey”. “Feelings of insecurity are not singular. Everyone experiences those, no matter where you come from, what your size is or what your race is,” she says. “I want people to understand that, really, the journey of life is to push past those feelings.” One of her most recent Instagram posts, a poolside selfie in a neon yellow bikini, is captioned “just here to remind you that you don’t need to be an hourglass to wear a high-cut bathing suit … would recommend not subscribing to bullsh*t that robs you of self-love”.The real trouble with “flattering” is that it presses mute on what fashion can be, and what your wardrobe can say about you. Great clothes can spread joy, not just minimise your waist. They should amplify your personality, not shrink your silhouette. Deplatforming “flattering” from the lexicon is about the narrative arc of a woman’s life not being plotted according to the numbers on the scales.“It is probably impossible for anyone to go through life without struggling with body image issues at times,” says Bhatia. “People expect me to be super-body-positive because I’m a plus-size woman in the fashion industry. That’s not where I’m at with my body. Talking about clothes being ‘flattering’ is unhelpful because it brings fashion back around to my insecurities. It’s exhausting to think about my body that much. And I’ve got so many more interesting things to think about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/607d649ad00c8701357f592ae36a5bd57666bbac/95_0_3598_2160/master/3598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3751c0dc489fc2c239fa0185042645c9","title":"spree review","story":"Stranger Things’ Joe Keery tries to give us a Travis Bickle for the Instagram age, but the script is hopelessly superficialWhat if instead of roaming the streets of New York in his yellow taxicab, Travis Bickle cruised LA behind the wheel of an Uber listening to bad techno?

He is Kurt Kunkle, a relentlessly upbeat 23-year-old who has been trying to make it as a social media influencer for the past decade.

Director Eugene Kotlyarenko shoots in a style that might be described as found footage 2.0 – filming as if on the characters’ smartphones, their followers’ comments popping up on screen. It works up to a point, but he doesn’t have a way with filming violence the grisly murders here are neither scary nor funny. And there is little to explain what turned Kurt into a homicidal maniac, other than one of his passengers calling him a “loser incel”.

The world’s most expensive footballer had played for much of the game like a man trapped inside another kind of storyline, finding space fluently but shooting at goal like a man wearing wooden clogs.Gian Piero Gasperini’s Atalanta underdogs had played with familiar verve to lead 1-0 with 90 minutes already up. At which point PSG’s labouring star machine finally found some relief.Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, on as a 79th-minute substitute, swung a fine cross into the box, and the ball was deflected in off a combination of an Atalanta defender and Marquinhos.Three minutes later, with extra time looming, Neymar played an extraordinary, high-pressure pass, taking the ball in a small space outside the area, freezing the moment, then sliding the ball inside José Palomino to meet the run of Kylian Mbappé. His low cross was equally precise. Choupo-Moting turned the ball into the net to set up a semi-final with either RB Leipzig or Atlético Madrid next Tuesday.Atalanta will remain the wider story and not just because of another stirring show from this high-intensity team of low-cost parts. A Champions League quarter-final represents an all-time high, albeit one that will be coloured by other emotions. The horrors of March in Bergamo are well-documented. This is a region still processing its grief. Freewheeling success on the football field is not a fix or a balm for this kind of real-life pain. But all things considered, it is not a bad place to start.The other story is, of course, Neymar, and a step into fresh territory for Thomas Tuchel’s version of that oddly brittle PSG star vehicle. Neymar remains, for all the outstanding moments, an object of some frustration among those baffled by the choice to move at his peak to an environment as lukewarm as Ligue 1.And yet, Neymar did deliver and did so when his team needed it most. There are stronger opponents in the draw but not many better attacks, with Mbappé likely also to be fit for the next round.The Estádio da Luz had provided an agreeably haunting stage for the latest instalment of midsummer Covid-bal. The late evening kick-off meant Lisbon was at least mercifully cool, a step down from the predicted mid-August firepit.Atalanta had Marco Sportiello in goal, with Josip Ilicic absent for domestic reasons. PSG were without Ángel Di María and Marco Verratti, with Mbappé on the bench.The action was frantic from the start. It took Neymar two minutes to produce an astonishing miss, running in on goal unimpeded from the centre circle, then shanking the ball five yards wide of the right-hand post.Unconcerned by their own suicidally high defensive line, Atalanta set about besieging the PSG end. With 10 minutes gone Hans Hateboer drew a clawing save from Keylor Navas and the game settled into a series of crisp, direct Atalanta attacks, broken up by the occasional white-shirted counter.For a while that powerful PSG midfield began to dictate its more stately rhythms but it was Atalanta who took the lead. Duván Zapata found space just outside the box, tumbling over as the ball ran on to Mario Pasalic. His first-time shot zinged into the top corner.The response was familiarly staccato. Neymar produced a nutmeg on Pasalic then pinged a shot just wide. Otherwise Atalanta held their high line and swarmed around the ball, their combinations zippy and urgent where PSG seemed to be playing through a midsummer haze.Neymar had time before the break to miss another presentable chance, blasting miles over the bar after seizing on a terrible pass from Hateboer and sending Tuchel into mild frenzy in his dugout.Tuchel has something agreeably pale and gaunt about him at the best of times, striding about the touchline looking like a sad-eyed victorian wraith. In Lisbon, left leg encased in a surgical boot, he could be seen shielding his brow and flinching in horror at times in that first half.Mbappé, his remaining ace, was sent out to warm up at the interval. And PSG did start with more purpose after the break. Neymar continued to find space but still lacked any sense of edge.

Nevertheless, he’s here.Speaking through a translator, Ahmed explains how, with the loss of this year’s tourist season due to the pandemic, his seasonal job in the nearby island resorts of Djerba has failed to materialise. Now he’s saving what money he can from casual work at a local gym for the 4,000 Tunisian dinars, (£1,125) he’ll need to make the illegal crossing from Tunisia into Europe.“In Tunisia you can work, but you don’t make money. What you earn, you consume. Before coronavirus there were no jobs,” he says, referring to the country’s endemic unemployment. “Now with coronavirus it’s not going to get better.”Departing from points along Tunisia’s coast, Tunisians are now the largest group of nationals arriving in Italy, according to figures from the interior ministry, testing its reception centres to the limit. In the first six months of 2019, 1,277 arrivals from Tunisia were intercepted by Italian authorities. This year, that number rose to 6,628.In July alone, as the pandemic took hold and the waters calmed, 4,252 migrants were intercepted by Italian authorities, compared with 502 the previous year. These numbers do not include those who landed in Italy undetected.Compared with many countries so far Tunisia’s brush with Covid-19 has been light. At the time of writing, only 1,678 cases of the virus had been detected, resulting in 51 deaths, though the threat of a potential second spike looms ominously.However, for an economy still struggling to recover from the conditions that led to its 2011 revolution, the combined effect of the lockdown, the loss of its tourism season and the global economic downturn is proving devastating.By the government’s own estimate, joblessness in the tourism sector alone could reach 400,000.Moreover, Tunisia’s small traders working on the margins of society risk being pushed to breaking point.Meddeb said a recent law prohibiting the dismissal of workers for economic reasons during the pandemic was well-intentioned but has only served to postpone the coming storm, as wage bills remain fixed and the drastic drop in demand pushes Tunisian companies to the brink.In the meantime, illegal migration flourishes. Unlike the industrial human trade in nearby Libya – and, according to locals, from points north along the Tunisian coast where migrants make the trip on larger craft – migration from Zarzis remains very much an artisan affair. Fishermen in Zarzis, one of the country’s largest fishing ports, occasionally make their boats available to pilots, who will then steer the tiny craft to Italy, undisturbed by international radars. Given the huge scale of the sprawling port, passage is not hard to find.“Whereas in Libya the trafficking of migrants is managed by solid and structured criminal organisations, in Tunisia the smuggling racket is often run by groups of fishermen,” says Salvatore Vella, a prosecutor in Agrigento who is leading the investigations on alleged human trafficking from Tunisia to Sicily.“They take 70 to 80 people on board, and when they arrive within a few miles of the island, they put the passengers in small boats to complete the journey on their own. Then they return to the Tunisian coasts and carry on with their fishing activities. It sounds like smuggling has become an additional source of income for some Tunisian fishermen, as their earnings have also decreased because of the Covid emergency.”While images of Tunisians arriving in Italy apparently dressed for their holidays pulling suitcases on wheels and carrying poodles have provided ample fodder for the country’s right-wing commentators, there is little doubt of the poverty that grips many in Zarzis.Increasingly, entire families are among those departing, with more mothers and children now making the perilous 206-mile journey to connect with relatives already in Europe. Perhaps understandably, none of those approached by the  was willing to be quoted.However, Vella has no qualms about speaking up: “We are no longer witnessing exclusive arrivals of young people in search of a better future,” he says. “In the last few months, entire families have begun arriving at our shores, and from an array of social classes, even members of what we may describe as Tunisia’s middle class.“The impression is that the economic crisis caused by the pandemic has hit not only the poorest sectors of society, but also small- and medium-sized Tunisian businesspeople. They’re arriving with their pets and large suitcases, but not for a holiday. They’ve left their homes forever.”The preferred entry point for Tunisians is the island of Lampedusa, in Sicily, approximately 10 hours by boat from the coast of Zarzis. The arrival of thousands of Tunisians in recent weeks has led to overcrowding at the island’s welcome centre, which now holds more than 1,000 people. The majority of Tunisians who arrive at Lampedusa are transferred to Sicily, registered and then sent back to Tunisia on direct flights from Palermo to Tunis. Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte has threatened to increase such repatriation flights in response to the high number of arrivals. Consequently, the only choice for many migrants is to flee from Sicilian welcome centres to avoid repatriation.Under pressure to act, the Tunisian government has launched measures aimed at stemming the flow of migrants from its shores. From 6 August, the country announced the deployment of naval units, surveillance devices, and search teams to patrol the waters around the country’s known departure points.“The situation has become unmanageable,” says Lampedusa’s mayor, Totò Martello. “If the government fails to proclaim a state of emergency for Lampedusa, then I will.”For an island that was once heralded for its welcoming of migrants, the wave of recent arrivals from Tunisia has worn thin the resolve of some islanders, who accuse the authorities of putting the management of the asylum seekers on citizens’ shoulders.In June Vella launched an investigation into an arson attack that destroyed the “migrant boats graveyard” of Lampedusa. Hundreds of dilapidated boats used over the years by migrants setting forth from North Africa were set ablaze, causing panic among islanders in what investigators believed was a political attack against the authorities – the latest in a series of attacks against pro-migrant symbols. Three days earlier, the monumental work “Gateway to Europe” was vandalised, designed by artist Mimmo Paladino in 2008 and a memorial to the migrants who perished while attempting the journey from North Africa to Europe.“There’s a parallel between the effect of the pandemic on the economy of Tunisia and the economic consequences in Sicily,” says Martello. “Even those who should welcome migrants, like us islanders, are in a bind because of the effects of the Covid crisis.”Elsewhere in Zarzis, within the city’s sweltering backstreets, Ridha showed the  round his home, pointing to the bed where he slept in the open, and the outhouse where his brother slept. Their mother lives in the house’s two threadbare rooms.With medical bills to pay for the family, Ridha has been offered free passage on condition he serves as mate to the boat’s skipper. The trip would provide him with the opportunity to send regular money home. He is aware of the penalties for trafficking, up to 10 years’ imprisonment according to a 2016 law, but in reality closer to six months, and is reluctant to make the trip. Instead, he will save what he can from sporadic house painting work and selling fish. But the temptation to leave Tunisia is strong. As a passenger, the worse the law can do is return him home, TD4,000 worse off.“In Europe, you can earn €50 (£45) to €60 a day. I can take €20 a day and send the rest back,” Ridha says. “Then I can bring my family over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7688119cd221130fe20d8ed0041218bf34864bb5/0_314_5848_3510/master/5848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0b3b1472e35e350d3f103d8c377702c","title":"peace where rights arent trampled afghan womens demands ahead of taliban talks","story":"With negotiations set to begin, women have been sharing their ‘red lines’ on the progress they refuse to see negotiatedFarahnaz Forotan was three when the Taliban had arrived in Kabul. It was 1996. “I have this memory of a snowy day, I was sitting on my mother’s lap, in a minibus, and she was crying. I didn’t understand why she was crying,” Forotan says. It was the day her family became refugees.“It was the civil war, and we had to leave our home and country to live in Iran – alive, but living in pain and facing discrimination,” she says.Now Forotan, whose family returned to Afghanistan in 2001, is making sure the militants who disrupted her childhood don’t use the upcoming peace talks to roll back gains women have made.“Today, the US and the world are surrendering us to the group that still kills us every day … in our streets, in our schools and even in our homes. We have been numbed into silence, by war, violence and pain, for far too long. But now we want to shout,” says Forotan.Talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government could start in Qatar this week, after the grand assembly, under pressure from the US, agreed on Sunday to release 400 militant prisoners, a Taliban condition for joining the negotiations.Many women fear that freedoms gained in the 20 years since the fall of the Taliban will be sacrificed in the talks. Just five womenare included in the 21-member negotiating team.Looking away from Forotan’s camera to protect her identity, a middle-aged woman from Helmand, one of the provinces worst hit by conflict, speaks in one of the videos:“I want peace that lasts. A five-day peace is not good for me or anyone. I was whipped in public once while taking my sick child to the doctor. When I asked the man why he hit me, he told me not to leave the house without a man. My husband is disabled, I am the breadwinner of the family. How can I not leave the house? We want permanent peace in which women’s rights are not trampled.”Nagina Anwari, a software engineer, is helping with the campaign. She says the peace process scares her. “I am scared because we are represented by only a few symbolic figures negotiating a possible return of the Taliban on my behalf.”Anwari, who is from Kandahar, once the capital of the regime, says memories of the Taliban’s atrocities are still fresh.“The girl in Kabul is struggling to make ends meet and seeking equal rights, while the girl in the village stays awake all night because she can no longer go to school and must get married forcefully. Their circumstances are different so their demands are different,” she says.“Another woman who had been married three times in the same house first to her husband’s brother after he was killed, then again to the younger brother after the second one was killed. What is left of her but an empty and desolate body that was scarified to war and ignorance?” she says.But Forotan also gathered stories of strength. “I witnessed women who have gone through all these hardships and are still working tirelessly so their children can study. I was left speechless meeting girls who so boldly challenged the stereotypes of society in their male-dominated cities,” she says.Afghan women, she says, are not just worried about their own rights. “Women are worried about the order and structure that we’ve achieved so far in the last 20 years. Even if it has its shortcomings, it is worth saving. These are not feminine or masculine demands they are the general concerns among the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8df75da852831c44da272d565525a630337cee86/283_398_6805_4085/master/6805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b407cd82df5d84c49d0a7af56262ad","title":"cup runneth over 17 ways to cook mushrooms recipes spiced rice pasta prosciutto","story":"Fungi recipes are incredibly varied and versatile. Keep it simple and serve them on toast, or push the boat out and craft a pithivierNot everyone likes mushrooms. In fact, edible fungi come in such an extraordinary variety of tastes, textures and shapes that it is probably impossible to like all of them.Personally, I am not tempted by mushrooms that lie at either the extremely small or extremely large end of the size scale. I accept that a very big portobello mushroom can readily replace the meat portion of a burger – a simple but effective recipe for that can be found here – but it is not something I would do. Also, I am a little afraid of those enoki mushrooms with the long stems and tiny caps. They have the look of something that went wrong while the lights were off. What I am saying is: you can allow yourself a few irrational prejudices and still count yourself a mushroom enthusiast. I do.That said, I am guilty of sometimes trying to make mushrooms disappear: throwing them on top of a pizza, or into a stew, a pasta sauce or an omelette, chiefly because I have a sneaking feeling they have been in the fridge too long and a firm belief that they can’t do any harm. It may be time to fully embrace the idea of cooking with mushrooms deliberately.You don’t normally have to rinse mushrooms, but you certainly can if you feel they need it – just do it quickly, so they don’t soak up too much moisture. They already contain plenty of water – especially the ordinary white sort – which is why they can turn out soggy when you sauté them. Keeping the heat high should help the moisture evaporate.As quick, basic meals go, mushrooms on toast make for an elegant dish – “the best of the something-on-toasts”, as Nigel Slater puts it. Thankfully, this elegance is not a function of the effort involved. Add an egg and you have breakfast. Angela Hartnett’s version is like restaurant dining at home – and you could probably still manage it with a hangover. I would almost suggest you could manage it while drunk, but that is how accidents happen.Slater’s supper of mushrooms with ginger and coriander is just as quick to come together, as long as you have chopped up the garlic, ginger, chilli and spring onions before you start, as he suggests. Likewise, his spiced mushroom rice requires the preparation of a paste consisting of spinach, peanuts, red curry paste and groundnut oil. He also uses sushi rice, which needs to be soaked for half an hour first, but you can substitute basmati with no loss of face.I make Claire Saffitz’s mushroom pasta with prosciutto a lot, but I still watch the video tutorial every time, because I think the precise order of operations is the key to it. Like many of the recipes here, it calls for a general medley of fancy mushrooms – a combination of whatever happens to be available – in no particular proportions. Those “exotic mix” mushroom packs you often find in supermarkets are handy for this, but they are expensive and never quite enough – pad out the weight with some ordinary chestnut mushrooms, sliced.Thanks to their texture, mushrooms often take the place of meat in classic recipes. Jamie Oliver’s mushroom stroganoff is a case in point. (Again, the mix of mushrooms employed can stretch to anything your budget will allow.) The Doctor’s Kitchen does a mushroom bourguignon. In this rogan mushrooms recipe by Anjum Anand, mushrooms stand in for lamb. Yotam Ottolenghi’s mushroom lasagne adds the earthy intensity of rehydrated porcini mushrooms to the mix.Mushrooms also stand up well to baking. This can be as painless as an all-in-one oven breakfast of eggs, mushrooms and ham, slapped into a tray and baked until the egg is set. You can add spinach or kale to the mix without complicating it in the slightest.Lunch could be as robust as Slater’s baked mushrooms – four large field mushrooms upturned on a tray, their caps filled with tarragon and mustard butter – or as delicate as Dan Lepard’s mushroom and cheese soufflé. Rachel Roddy’s potato and mushroom bake has last-minute supper written all over it.With a block of puff pastry at your disposal, you can attempt Ottolenghi’s mushroom tarts with pine nut and parsley salsa. Each has a lid made from a whole portobello mushroom, pressed into the mixture skin-side down.Ottolenghi also offers this mushroom pithivier – a domed French pie – as another way of deploying mushrooms with puff pastry. Mary Berry, meanwhile, turns shop-bought pastry into a spinach and mushroom en croûte made with gruyère, ricotta and egg yolk. It can be prepared up to eight hours before you need to bake it. Berry’s recipe also contains some typically lapidary advice: “Never make an en croûte larger than for 12.” Words to live by.Finally, if your old mushrooms are too tired even to hide in a late-night omelette, Tom Hunt has a way to make use of them: mushroom ketchup. As long as they smell OK, your withered fungi can be combined with onion, garlic, nutmeg, vinegar and horseradish to concoct this 18th-century condiment. Kept in the fridge, it will extend the life of your mushrooms for another month, which should give you plenty of time to work out what to put it on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5adaf72278a3fadd2509cf6a1d2a036fea47a26/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d73e16857fc5e41588672f1382496f7c","title":"this pandemic means we dont live in a timeline any more its more of a timesoup","story":"As the hours, days, weeks and months become a blur, it’s no longer clear if time is passing too quickly, or too slowly“The days are bleeding together and I no longer know what the passage of time is,” a friend in Melbourne messages me. She’s five weeks into her city’s second strict Covid lockdown, but what even is a week any more?Her days, as she describes them, are mostly work, a monotony broken up only by exercise, cooking, reading, sleeping, eating, as well as an activity she simply calls “balcony” – one that all locked-down apartment dwellers intuitively understand.“It just feels interminable,” she writes. “And the only thing that changes on the weekends is I don’t (always) get up and sit at my desk.”When describing this strange year, we reach for cliches like “unprecedented times” or “the weirdest timeline” – expressions that partly capture living through a plague, the shutdown of our cities, the rapid adoption of new habits like passing army checkpoints on state borders or actually using QR codes.But we’re also living in a moment where time itself, or at least our perception of it, is being configured anew.In places under hard lockdown, the days, naturally, can feel endless and indistinct. A survey of 1,000 Americans in April found half felt that time had slowed down – views researchers said correlated with respondents feeling nervous or stressed. Time flies when you’re having fun – it’s little wonder it drags when you’re doomscrolling, looking for jobs that no longer exist or waiting for the next day’s Covid numbers.But even where the harshest restrictions have lifted, many of us are living discombobulated lives, absent from the activities and structure that used to demarcate morning from night, work time from leisure time, and the days and weeks and months from each other.Despite utopian hopes that working from home would give us more time to ourselves, many of us are finding the opposite – we live at work now, in front of our screens more than ever, and have to make conscious effort to contain the work day to something approaching the hours we’re paid for.Last week (I think?) I got a knot in my chest when I read that my local pub had been named as a potential Covid transmission site on a night in late July – one of a series of venues a young guy who’d since tested positive visited on what sounded like a freewheeling and distinctly Before-Times-style weekend. Shit, I thought, I had a drink there recently. Last week? Three weeks ago? A Saturday – or was it Wednesday? What day is it today? And since when was it no longer July? I had to scroll through text messages and photos on my phone for clues to my movements over the last few weeks, looking for any little breadcrumbs to find my way back through the thickets of my memory (my last visit, it turns out, predated his by a full week).We don’t live in a timeline anymore, more of a timesoup.Perhaps ironically, this sense of slowness or disorientation can be overlaid with anxiety about the year passing quickly, because many of us haven’t really done anything. That it is already August – August! – feels stressful, galling even.Everyone has their own version of this anxiety, not so much FOMO as just MO – jobs stalled or ended, fertility treatments delayed, overseas moves or trips scrapped, weddings or milestone birthday parties cancelled. Women my age tend to already face particular anxiety about time passing – hectored daily about ticking biological clocks, returning to work, slicking the right kinds of oils and acids on your face to deny the passage of time itself. We are always supposed to be on a journey of personal growth, of optimisation. But in our homes, month after month, it can feel like the only things growing are the monsteras and that pile of unread books. As 2020 rolls on, it can be hard to quiet that familiar busybody voice whispering “tick tock” inside your head.What makes defeating that voice harder is that the future is so uncertain – plans are almost impossible to make. We are all having to yield to Covid time in a way, to accept a pause in place of relentless progress. And within it, finding new ways to process and enjoy the time we have.In her recent book Funny Weather, Olivia Laing writes about how gardening situates you in a “different kind of time, the antithesis of the agitating present.” Laing shares a story from Virginia Woolf’s diary in 1939, when Woolf called her husband in to listen to Hitler on the radio. “I shan’t come in,” he shouts from the garden, “I’m planting iris, they will be flowering long after he is dead.”Another friend tells me watching her toddler son getting bigger and learning new words was one of the only things to break that sense of stasis during her first lockdown. “The only thing marking time was him,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b26659c7ff8c2b736fe0f1ba3a56f8492d1023/0_163_5100_3062/master/5100.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2f72aecd1d83b881fbc49986c5b6b804","title":"cardi b megan thee stallion wap celebrated not scolded","story":"The hit collaboration between the two rappers has become a belated song of the summer, empowering women and enraging prudes along the wayTwo rap powerhouses, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, had united to create a mysterious single, and the internet waited with bated breath. There was just a title, WAP, a pink background, and the two stars with their tongues out (a shared signature of sorts) appearing in shared high-teased updos and gold hoop earrings. Even with communal dance spaces essentially banned due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the collaboration between the two rappers was almost guaranteed to be a hit. Shortly before its release, Cardi admitted YouTube would not accept the more explicit cut of the song and even the “clean version” was almost too sexually explicit for radio, adding to building speculation of what the song might sound like.With the famed Baltimore house producer and former Atlanta radio DJ Frank Ski’s voice booming in the background, the song reveals its content: it’s about sex. The video doesn’t conceal this, beginning with Cardi and Megan as fountain statues posed in a manner reminiscent of Lil Kim.While the video’s audio tones down the sexual content – the pair rap “wet and gushy” rather than “wet ass pussy” – it doesn’t dismiss it either. The imagery is inherently carnal. With gold statues of a bust fountain and a butt mounted on the wall in a hallway, Cardi and Megan appear in matching coiffed updos and respective pink and yellow bodysuits with floor-length trains dragging behind them, as Cardi raps the opening lyrics of WAP: “Certified freak  Seven days a week  Wet and gushy  Made his pullout game weak.”WAP, which has since dominated social media discourse and YouTube (76m views and counting), isn’t the first time Megan or Cardi have rapped about sex, even so explicitly. Fans have pointed out the song isn’t quite as risque as lyrics of late 90s and early 2000s rappers like Trina, Lil Kim, and Adina Howard – a sentiment partially shared by Cardi herself. Visually, the message is about sex, women enjoying sex, and women celebrating being sexy. Those who make an appearance are draped in latex. With cameos from singers Normani and Rosalia, rappers Mulatto, Rubi Rose and Sukihana who mimes the act of oral sex, the video is unapologetic in celebrating the sensuality and sexuality of women. It isn’t shy or coy, it’s about the loud articulation of female desire for sex, as they want it, and it centers them as active participants with agency.Female response has largely been overwhelmingly positive since its premiere on 7 August. Christina Aguilera posted a photo of herself, saying the song “made her feel some type of way”. Halle Berry tweeted she went out to her car to enjoy the song, away from her children. Viola Davis retweeted a video of her How to Get Away with Murder character Annalise Keating dancing to the song and even reposted a photoshopped version of herself into the cameo of Kylie Jenner. Others like Remy Ma, Azealia Banks, Halsey and JoJo have all publicly voiced their support.Reminiscent of the slut-shaming of Janet Jackson’s 2004 Super Bowl incident, the censure was laden with misogyny. Some of the criticism read as people thinking the lyrical content was absurd, as though a woman’s pleasure from sex was unheard of before WAP. This recoil didn’t happen in a vacuum: misogyny is laden in American society and shows no sign of abating. It is the same hypocrisy which excusesDonald Trump’s “Grab ’em by the pussy” comment, which implies non-consensual acts of sexual violence, while simultaneously condemning Cardi and Megan for publicly discussing their prowess and preferences. Megan used Twitter to address the double standard, chiding men who acted superciliously in response to WAP but previously hadn’t had a problem with songs by male musicians with sexual content, like Three 6 Mafia’s Slob on My Knob, a song about oral sex, tweeting: “Lol dudes will scream ‘slob on my knob’ word for word and crying abt WAP bye lil boy.” Cardi also addressed the reaction, calling the conservative backlash “KINDA ICONIC” and even mocked Shapiro’s a cappella lyric reading.Similarly, the pair’s refusal to be shamed for liking and craving sex is, as Cardi puts it, “iconic”. Their refusal to discuss engaging in sexual intercourse with the sole intent to please men unseats the dehumanizing narrative which robs women of sexual agency. In WAP, they assert their inclination in a manner which prioritizes their enjoyment, not that of a man’s. In a world where sex work is increasingly becoming more equitably commodified by women, but where rape culture and patriarchy are still frighteningly dominant, there is something rebellious and subversive in women, especially oft-oversexualized black women, openly discussing enthusiasm and predilections for intercourse.With all things considered, in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, an unmitigated economic disaster looming, and an upcoming presidential election with climate change hanging constantly in the background, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion enjoying sexual intercourse should be the least of concerns in the world.

It was paused at the height of the pandemic and gradually restarted with the expectation that it will conclude later this year.Apparently concerned at how No 10 would respond to criticism, Ellwood said he hoped that the defence committee would “not be viewed an adversary of government, but instead as a constructive critic and contributor”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d74b0ce51f950202b31337389cf10760f6c8688/0_265_3979_2388/master/3979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7434276fbb28c9f49685cd1b265f2c7","title":"priti patel seeks advice on confirming legality of poppers","story":"Poppers were given a reprieve from inclusion in a ban on formerly legal highs in 2016The home secretary has sought to clarify the legal status of poppers, in a move campaigners said highlighted “the absurdity of current drug legislation”.Alkyl nitrite preparations, widely known as poppers, have resided in a legal grey area after being given a last-minute reprieve from inclusion in a ban on formerly legal highs in 2016, following an outcry from gay people, led by former Tory minister Crispin Blunt.In a letter to the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), Priti Patel wrote that the group had said poppers did not fall within the scope of the Psychoactive Substances Act because they did not have a direct effect on the central nervous system.“However, a Court of Appeal judgment in 2018 confirmed that substances which have only an indirect psychoactive effect can still be captured by the 2016 Act,” she said.“As a consequence the lawfulness of the supply of poppers is uncertain. I am minded to remove this uncertainty by explicitly exempting poppers from the 2016 Act. I would seek the ACMD’s advice on an exemption.“My officials will work with you to provide more detail on the proposed wording of an exemption as you consider the issue.”In her letter to the ACMD, Patel also said she wanted the panel to investigate how to prevent sales of illicit drugs online and to research the reasons behind growing powder cocaine use among young people.Campaigners said the government was avoiding substantive change to reduce record drug-related deaths – 4,359 people across the UK in 2018 – and queried why the issue had suddenly reappeared.“This would be a useful technical clarification but one which highlights the absurdity of current drug legislation,” said Steve Rolles, senior policy analyst at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation.“To have a home secretary effectively request the formal legalisation of poppers, while deaths from other drugs spiral, shows misplaced priorities.“There are countless other issues the ACMD should more usefully and urgently address including the establishment of overdose prevention centres, drug safety testing, or programmes to ert people caught in possession away from the criminal justice system altogether”Crispin Blunt, the Tory MP and chair of the Conservative Drug Policy Reform Group, who made an impassioned intervention to prevent government “stupidity” in banning poppers in 2016, welcomed the move to clarify their status.“Many gay men will be grateful to the home secretary for this clear direction of policy, as indeed am I,” he said.“On other issues she seeks further information on how the dark and open web operates and around cocaine and GBLGHB use among the young. More evidence is crucial to better policy making and I welcome her seeking it on areas important to improving public health.”Poppers, used since the 1970s largely for their muscle-relaxing effects, increases blood flow to the body and is particularly popular with gay men who use it for sex. It is also used as a club drug as it creates a head-rush and a sense of euphoria.Although many of the so-called head shops where poppers were formerly sold have closed, it remains openly on sale in some markets, cafes and shops – usually masquerading as a room odouriser. It can leave users feeling sick, faint and physically uncoordinated, with product quality not officially regulated.A Home Office spokesperson said: “As this letter sets out, we are continuing to work in consultation with the ACMD to consider any new evidence of misuse, harms and ersion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36be880332f717fba1964db6905c83f5442de8f/633_172_512_307/master/512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c591f0afd05944e28a9122392e8d1a89","title":"caring for my dad felt like something that had happened to me not a choice i made","story":"Like many other women, I started having to help my dad a little, then a lot, and before I knew it someone was calling me a carerOne night in early 2016, I found myself calling for an ambulance. My father had locked himself in the toilet for four hours and wasn’t responding to anyone. My brother and I listened at the door. Nothing. The person at the other end of the 999 call had a volley of questions: “Why did he choose the toilet? Does he have a weapon? Do you think he is suicidal?” I replied with don’t know, no and no. They wanted his rejection of life to be defined as an absolute, but it was far more shadowy and ambiguous.Panicked, I called a mental health crisis helpline too, who advised me to connect with my father through the toilet door. “Speak louder, put some force into the words,” he told me, as though I was auditioning for a part. My dad did not reply. It had been hours since I had last heard his voice, fragile, fading to a whisper. My younger brother was trying his best to help. After rummaging through a toolbox, he found a screwdriver to force between door and lock. White flakes of paint flew the door swung open and there was my father. He was wearing his pyjamas, standing upright, his body locked into a strange, repetitive loop. His left arm would rise, jerk above his head, then his right foot would lift, and the mechanical process would begin all over again. His face was scarlet, screwed into a fist of agony.When the ambulance crew arrived, we had difficulty communicating his illness. Catatonia, we explained, uncertainty in our voices. Even his doctors seemed puzzled by the state he had become prone to slipping into: a sort of waking coma, where he was conscious but his body became disconnected. In the days that followed, he was sectioned in a psychiatric ward. He could not walk, eat, speak or see, only hear. The nurses were feeding him but I worried about him becoming dehydrated, and when I visited I took along a bottle of fancy juice, put a straw into his mouth and coaxed him to drink. The sight of liquid seeping up the straw, the sound of it against his teeth and tongue, was a wild relief. It was also one of the few ways I could reach through the bars of his catatonia cage and find a way to communicate. His fists kept flying up involuntarily and hammering on the arms of his chair. I held his hands tight and spoke to him of better times, when he would be well again it was also a way of reassuring myself. The last time he’d had a catatonic collapse, he’d taken months to heal. There was no certainty that he would recover on this occasion.“Are you his carer?” It was a question that I kept being asked around this time. I usually replied: “Well, no, I’m his daughter.” I found the term carer puzzling and wondered why people were trying to pin it on to me. It made me think of nurses, white gowns, Florence Nightingale it made me feel I ought to have specialist medical knowledge and infinite reserves of compassion. Of course, I did care about my father I was desperately worried about him. But I did not consider myself as someone worthy of an official title of responsibility. I was in my late 30s, based in the north, a full-time writer, living a peripatetic, financially precarious existence. My father was in his early 70s and lived in London, alone after the death of my mother, his days bookended by the taking of medicines and filled with quiet habits: reading the paper, doing the odd shop, cooking himself a poached egg for dinner each night.He fell ill when I was three years old. He had always been a playful, loving father. Subsequently he seemed lost to us. He had been sectioned after being made redundant and suffering a nervous breakdown during his stay in the psychiatric ward, he developed schizophrenia. Open a textbook and you’ll find a list of symptoms for the illness – withdrawal, loss of desires, hallucinations, hearing voices – but it affects each person differently. For us, there was a sense of my father withdrawing from the world, becoming a silent, mysterious observer, almost wraithlike.With my father now back in the psychiatric ward, I tried to visit him every day. I liaised with doctors, played Scrabble with him, read to him from the paper, took bags of his clothes home, washed them, carried them back. The nights grew shorter, daffodils springing up on the lawns that framed the ward. The day he started speaking again was euphoric: the first major sign of recovery. Before my mother had died, my relationship with him had been virtually non-existent. Now I found myself becoming closer to him, discovering what a kind and sweet man he was beneath his quiet persona. A tenderness blossomed between us.As he grew better, I went into decline. My workload was heavy. By the end of each day I wanted to curl up foetal in bed with exhaustion, and the walk to the bus stop, the start of my journey to visit him, became a trudge.It was a lonely time. My partner of three years was based in the north, anchored there by his daughter from a previous relationship. Insomnia set in. I would wake in the early hours, worried about Dad, about work deadlines I was failing to meet on four or five hours sleep I fumbled through white-fuzz days. If I was a carer, I thought, then I’m failing at this task. It was a relief when, one night on the ward, I heard a man cheerfully saying to his sick wife: “I’m glad they’ve let me change my shifts, when I was on night duty visiting you every day nearly killed me.” Eventually, I cut back on work in order to devote more time to my father, but then my finances suffered. Bankruptcy became a genuine threat.When my father was released, the relief came: now life can go back to normal. But a few months later, I was working downstairs at the dining table when I heard the sound of water pitter-pattering on the floor. My father had been at the sink, washing his hands, when he collapsed into catatonia. As I returned to a routine of visits and doctors’ discussions, my relationship collapsed. By choosing to stay south for the past year, I had put my father ahead of my boyfriend. It had not felt like a conscious decision. Caring had always felt like something that happened to me, not a choice I’d made. I realised that life was never going to be “normal” again.My father is much better these days, for I have moved in with him permanently. There are times when I feel sad about my love life being compromised, days when I wish I had the freedom to travel or live abroad, but I cherish the close bond between us and the fierce, protective love for him that has taken root in my heart. Being called a carer is something I have grown used to.• Sam Mills is author of The Fragments of My Father: A Memoir of Madness, Love and Being a Carer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cf1043ec36d84f246a2c19e0186b6dc26132a7e/0_123_2385_1430/master/2385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82de987f991f1d48dd724ca0a116a31","title":"england and pakistan both have hurdles to overcome in second test","story":"The hosts must cope without the input of Stokes while the tourists must bounce back having had just five days to recover from the first Test defeatThey are called Test matches for a reason. They represent the ultimate challenge for any cricketer. Even the one-day wizards from Virat Kohli to Eoin Morgan to Jos Buttler acknowledge that and it may be that those challenges are even more demanding this week – for both sides.Pakistan, for example, have had to endure the setback of losing a Test match on the last day that they seemed to be winning for the previous three. All their efforts came to nothing as Chris Woakes and Jos Buttler swept aside cricketing logic and the forest of dubious statistics that are churned out whenever there is a fourth innings run chase. Once they start the Tests keep coming and Pakistan may not have the strength in depth of the England squad those bowlers have to keep bowling. Moreover they are far from home in alien conditions where the instinctive reaction to a fan seeking a photograph ends up sending shivers down the spines of the organisers of this Test series.Meanwhile England have been in lockdown for most of the last seven weeks, a weird existence that would have tested the patience and self-denial of teams past. They have just lost their charismatic all-rounder, Ben Stokes, for the rest of the series and when this was the case in Australia they looked a toothless outfit.Stokes clearly has a major input on and off the field. In both areas he is so often the heartbeat of the side. Now as vice-captain he has become Joe Root’s first source of advice as the captain himself acknowledged on the eve of the match. “He is someone who thinks outside the box. He looks at the game well and sees things I don’t. As a pair, between us we come up with different ideas, have options, and that’s a good place to be you don’t want a yes man. Other than that, he is always leading from the front, like his bowling on the third evening at Old Trafford. We know what an influence he is for us to be the best side we can be. But we now get more knowledge of what it’s like when he’s not there because there will be times when he’s injured or similar.”Of course they will miss him but Root is right to regard his absence as an opportunity for the team to grow and to prove that they can cope without him. Since Root has overseen six consecutive victories in Test cricket, however chaotic or unlikely the odd one is, it is reasonable to suggest that his team is improving. So readily vilified like many captains before him, Root has now won 23 Tests as England captain in 42 outings in charge. He does not get everything right but he must be getting something right. The key is that they play for him.There is always scope to disagree with some of the decisions he makes, or which he can influence. There were moments in the last Test when we scratched our heads at his decision to have a dual off-spin attack just before taking the new ball in Pakistan’s first innings in the second he seemed to have forgotten about Woakes the bowler.After every squad announcement this column expresses bewilderment – I may as well get this out the way now – when they pick a squad of 14 players, which requires them to leave out as many as three pacemen on the morning of the match but allows no alternative spinning option. Until now Root and the rest of the brains trust has embraced the rotation policy for pacemen but not for any other type of cricketer, which seems a missed opportunity.This has been the perfect summer to experiment with rotation because of the peculiar schedule. It should allow the set-up to be more comfortable with this system and it should be a useful dry run for the next Ashes series in Australia, where rotation of pacemen in testing conditions is a sound plan. However my impression before this Test against Pakistan is that there may be some backtracking. Decisions may be swayed by the yearning to clinch the series confidence in the alternatives may not be so deep as we have been led to believe.We will see on Thursday morning but there were murmurs that England’s solitary change for the second Test would be an enforced one with Zak Crawley coming in for Stokes, leaving Root with the same five bowlers. In which case Jimmy Anderson and Jofra Archer, both of whom looked ripe for rotation in Manchester, may continue in the side with Mark Wood and Sam Curran staying on the sidelines along with Ollie Robinson. In a heatwave, albeit a thundery one, it would be bizarre to omit a specialist spinner. However the two sides line up – and there is the possibility that Fawad Alam might come in for Shadab Khan – a match half as exciting as the first Test should satisfy everyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9151c4e01790a764e83d609c62ee19310f81b7e8/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=56255e4de2f2242ff80de2f7e732e01b","title":"tristram kenton chekhov in pictures","story":"In a new series, we open up  photographer Tristram Kenton’s archive of stage photos.

I visit with my partner, Kathryn, a couple of days before the public opening, and we check into number four, a beautiful and spacious hut – they’re called “garden wagons” here – built by Dorchester company Plankbridge.The hotel’s main building is a mansion with sections that date from the 1600s and others from two centuries later. This mix means the windows and ornate ceilings have a Tudor-cum-ecclesiastical feel. Upstairs there are 11 smallish, elegantly furnished rooms. Slate-grey walls generate a moody ambience, and paintings of maritime subjects feature tempestuous seas. A staff member tells us the vibe is down to owner and designer Judy Hutson’s fascination with Cornwall’s stormy weather: one large oil painting on the main staircase was finished in situ so that the artist could ensure the right kind of wave action to liven up the high walls. A pair of two-storey newbuilds – known together as The Stonehouse, and carefully designed to look similar to the old house – have been added at the rear to offer a further 15 bright, airy accommodations. Back in the main house, flagstone floors, stained glass, roughly rendered walls and mix’n’match furniture have transformed the ground floor into a series of intimate dining spaces, where head chef Adam Bristow leads cooks, gardeners and foragers. The “25-mile menu” features Camel Valley mussels, delectable Cornish sardines, Fowey duck breast and six colourful veggie starters including a “meaty” barbecue cauliflower steak.Some items, including hoppy Verdant beers from Falmouth, come from beyond the 25-mile perimeter, and a few key ingredients, such as Loch Duart salmon (smoked on site) and Manx kippers, have to be brought in from afar, but owner Robin Hutson is adamant about keeping food miles down where possible. “I believe the hotel trade does more for local food producers than just about any other sector. There’s no need not to use suppliers in the area,” he says.I choose a starter of “piggy bits” (honey-sweet crackling with apple sauce plus potted pork), and a “Barnsley” chop as a main: a double loin of tender pork that covers half my plate, served with wild gooseberries and sea beets. Kathryn has mutton with baked lettuce and red wine sauce. The sourcing policy may be worthy and right-on, but the food at the Pig is unashamedly indulgent.Harlyn Bay’s deep sandy beach – perennially popular with young trainee surfers – is 10 minutes from the hotel, along a footpath through a poppy field. You can get there without walking on the lanes, which is just as well as they can be hairy in high season. Very early morning and late afternoon are the best times to see it without crowds, and low tide is also wisest high water forces everybody to congregate near the cliffs. The north Cornwall sea is a touch warmer than on the south coast and the wavelets were swimmable.When the weather is sunny the beaches are too noisy, so we take off on the South West Coast Path towards Padstow. I live in south Devon so know the path well, and this seven-mile section is as good as any I’ve explored. North of Trevone Bay are high cliffs above inaccessible coves and a sea stack around which we see herring gulls enjoying the thermals, fulmars and a strange darker gull I can’t identify. On the higher stretches we see over to Bodmin Moor. After passing Stepper Point – home to a National Coastwatch lookout – at the tip of the headland, we turn to walk south along the Camel River, enjoying a cooling dip at Harbour Cove. Padstow is madness and mayhem, as has been widely reported, but we grab a bag of fish and chips from Chip Ahoy and a local directs us to a shady park unused by tourists. The Pig sends a car to collect us. It is a Land Rover, so perfect for “PadStein”.For our second day we linger over a slow breakfast at the hotel and enjoy two swims off Harlyn Bay, a look around the newly planted kitchen garden, and lunch at the Pig’s Lobster Shed: an informal alfresco space serving Padstow lobster, North Cornish crabs, and long, sweet chocolate sundaes. It exudes a beach vibe and the sort of cuisine Rick does over in Padstow, but with none of the aggro of either. Both the main restaurant and Shed are open to non-guests who book in advance.This midweek visit is just what I need after four-and-a-bit months of lockdown. We can mingle or escape to our hut. I imagine many guests will think first of staying in the main house antiquity and “authenticity”, not to mention TV dramas full of billowing white shirts, have an undeniable pull. But I am as happy as a porker in spa-quality mud in our garden wagon. I’m 6ft 3in, but undergo no headbanging or curved-spine sleep. There is a large roll-top bath as well as a power shower and an outdoor shower with walls made from branches. Call me antisocial, but I currently want to choose how close I am to strangers, and that’s easier in a bespoke wooden shed than in any period building. I can’t see the stormy oil paintings as much as I’d like, but I can hear the sea at night, summer-calm and soothing.• Accommodation was provided by The Pig at Harlyn Bay, which has doubles from £150 a night midweek, breakfast from £10pp, thepighotel"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f564dc7684c764272972b550637b1d8e0f3c17d4/0_233_2937_1761/master/2937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52e11398a85b0ce5e177d188a61bd03b","title":"ted lasso review apple soccer sitcom plays an unfunny old game","story":"Jason Sudeikis is the US coach of a British football team in a middling fish-out-of-water comedy that never finds its footingWith an ever-expanding wealth of new content at our fingertips, with new platforms launching on what feels like a weekly basis, one is likelier than ever to encounter a new show that causes a mantra to repeat as each episode unfurls: there’s just too much TV for this. As I watched Apple’s middling new transatlantic sitcom Ted Lasso, it was all I could hear in my head, a show that isn’t unwatchably bad but isn’t really much of anything, an in-the-background time-waster ill-suited to a time when there are so many other better things to be watching.Lasso is a small-time American college football coach played by Jason Sudeikis, a character originated in a viral NBC Sports promo for its coverage of the Premier League. He’s been drafted in to lead an English team despite no knowledge of the game. He’s enthusiastic and unperturbed by his inexperience, unlike the fans and players who greet him, largely with the word “wanker”. The reason for his hiring is swiftly revealed as part of a Producers-style twist involving the club’s new chairman, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham), taking over from her philandering husband and eager to tank the club fast just to spite him.As overused as the fish-out-of-water set-up may be, it’s a timeless construction and when supported by sharp writing and some self-awareness of how hackneyed the subgenre now is, it can still be incredibly funny. But Sudeikis and experienced sitcom writer-producer Bill Lawrence (whose many credits include Scrubs, Cougar Town and The Nanny) start at the very bottom and stay there with a series of predictably base clashes of culture as Ted arrives in the UK. He asks for a coffee but all they have is tea! He doesn’t know the offside rule! He goes for Indian food but it’s so spicy it gives him an upset stomach! It’s grindingly unfunny as well as, at times, rooted in some questionable and uneasy stereotypes (aside from that bowel-inflaming curry, there’s also an overly enthusiastic Nigerian player who insists on befriending everyone).It’s a relic in some ways while also a sign of the times in others because there’s something a little overly calculated in how its ingredients are assembled, an attempt by Apple to do a number of things at once without doing one of them particularly well. Taking an American comedy star and dropping them in a UK sitcom is now a common tactic (Andy Samberg in Cuckoo, David Cross in The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret and, most recently, David Schwimmer in Intelligence) as an attempt to appeal to both audiences, something that’s of even more importance when a title like this has a global release date. There’s also a rather clumsy attempt to add a melancholic undercurrent, as if to emulate a far greater show such as the transatlantic hit The Office, which doesn’t work here because the comedy is so broad and so silly that suddenly insisting we take the one-note characters with any real gravity feels incongruous.The main problem, though, is that the titular character isn’t interesting or funny or substantial enough to warrant a commercial-to-sitcom expansion. He’s well-intentioned and warm-hearted yet also arrogant enough to think he can pull off an impossible task without doing that much work, a problem that, at least in the early episodes, isn’t explored enough. We’re expected to love him straight off the bat and while Sudeikis is fine, it would take a much better script for this immediate connection to work and instead the charm feels forced. Instead, it’s the British supporting cast who prove more engaging with slightly more nuanced characters to play, such as musical theatre star Waddingham as the new boss, Juno Temple as a savvy Wag (“I’m sort of famous for being almost famous”) and Nick Mohammed, who has the best comic delivery on the show, as Lasso’s new right-hand man.But brief sparks aren’t quite enough to power us through a sitcom that one would need to seek out to watch on a weekly basis (like most Apple shows, the first three episodes drop week one then it’s every Friday until October) and with so many better, smarter, funnier comedies available, it’s hard to understand why anyone would want to come back for more. It’s yet another fizzled opportunity for Apple."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/819622c79dafc3ea1332893298f401cc58596cc2/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53fcbc3f3655a33629c2aa4325585e2e","title":"osce election monitors us integrity november","story":"OSCE office for democratic institutions recommends sending 500 monitors for ‘most challenging’ US election in recent decadesAn international election-monitoring body has raised concerns about the US vote in November, saying the “integrity of election day proceedings” could be under threat and recommended again sending observers to monitor the election.The democracy and human rights arm of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has issued an assessment of election conditions in the run-up to presidential and congressional elections on 3 November.It recommended member states send 100 long-term and 400 short-term observers to monitor the poll which it said “will be the most challenging in recent decades”.A week-long needs assessment mission by the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) beginning on 29 May found there was widespread concern that “election officials will face serious challenges prior to and on election day, due to new measures in response to Covid-19 pandemic, and expressed concerns over their ability to overcome them.”In the view of officials and experts the assessment mission spoke to, the voting problems “may have an impact on the level of trust in election administration, which, in turn, could harm the integrity of election day proceedings, and ultimately cast doubt in the outcome of the elections”.Most of the officials and experts the mission talked to said they would welcome the presence of foreign election observers.The ODIHR began monitoring US elections after the disputed vote in 2000 which was ultimately resolved by the supreme court. The size of the observer missions was increased in 2016, and the 2020 contingent will remain at that level. In many US states there is no guarantee that international observers will be allowed in polling stations.The tone of the 2020 ODIHR report reflects far more alarm than in 2016, and notes that only some of its recommendations for improvements in the US electoral system have been acted on.“A lot of those recommendations haven’t been implemented,” said Dame Audrey Glover, a British human rights lawyer who led the 2016 US election observation mission. “None of the federal ones have, but some of the states have, some rather spasmodically, implemented bits of them.”Many of the ODIHR’s recommendations from 2016 were about voting rights for minorities. In particular the organization called on Congress to mend a hole in the Voting Rights Act created by a 2013 supreme court ruling invalidating a clause in the act that subjected any new voting laws passed by towns, counties or states with a history of racial discrimination to federal scrutiny.The House passed legislation to restore that scrutiny in 2019 but the Republican leadership has blocked the law from being debated in the Senate.The ODIHR also called on the US to review restrictions on voting rights for citizens with criminal convictions, and ensure that rights are restored on completion of sentence.There has been some, though very moderate, movement on this issue. Since 2018, Florida, Iowa and Kentucky, the last three states to permanently disenfranchise anyone with a felony conviction, have all ended their lifetime bans. But in Florida, Republicans undercut the reform, putting in place obstacles that still make it very difficult to vote. In Iowa and Kentucky, the governors issued executive orders ending the bans, which could be revoked by a future governor. Many states continue to disenfranchise people even once they are out of prison.There has also been little movement on ODIHR calls for an end to gerrymandering, and for the creation of independent bodies to draw district boundaries in a way that respects the equality of the vote.Glover raised concerns about a shortage of poll workers and observers because of the pandemic and a lack of capacity of the postal service to handle the flood of ballots.Despite the challenge presented by the November vote, the United States Postal Service (USPS) is implementing cost-saving measures, including a management hiring freeze, ordered by the new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, a major Republican fundraiser appointed by Trump in May.An ODIHR spokeswoman, Katya Andrusz, said: “You need to have confidence in the system on the part of the population and the lower that level of trust is, that says something in itself about the procedures and it says something about the state of democracy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b8701efa353ff33cd460c61e1a8299b9662b9bd/0_67_1688_1013/master/1688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0469620dab7f36d58e7221cb6c8d345e","title":"paddleboarding goat mr mayhem idaho","story":"Alyssa Kelley’s unusual pet likes to follow her everywhere, even on a lazy paddle down the riverFor an inidual named Mr Mayhem, he seemed very calm.

Ofqual, the regulator, has said it is “working urgently to operationalise” the new appeal route using mock exam grades, but further details would have to wait until next week. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, condemned the last-minute announcement of the appeals process as a “complete fiasco”. “It was obvious that this was going to be difficult but it’s been weeks or months in the coming,” he said.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said he was “incredibly sorry” for the disruption to students’ education but defended the approach used to standardise results, telling the BBC: “We’ve got a system that is, I believe, the fairest that we can do. But let’s not forget that we’ve been in a global pandemic – we’ve been in a situation none of us would have expected to be in.”Democrat pair hit the trail – In their first campaign appearance together, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris accused Donald Trump of leaving the US “in tatters” by failing to lead the country through the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. The Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates appeared at a high school in Biden’s home town of Wilmington, Delaware.Harris said: “America is crying out for leadership. Yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. A president who is making every challenge we face more difficult to solve.” The president’s campaign has attempted to attack Harris as “radical” and leftwing, though progressives in her own party view her as more moderate.Hottest spell in decades – The UK has had its longest stretch of temperatures exceeding 34C since 1961. Scorching heat was recorded in parts of southern England for the sixth day in a row. Warnings of thunderstorms and heavy rain are in place across the country – the Met Office has warned that flooding, damage to buildings, travel disruptions and power cuts are to be expected, as well as 30-40mm (1.1in to 1.6in) of rainfall in less than an hour in some places. A yellow thunderstorm warning covers much of England and Wales. Heavy downpours have already lashed large parts of Scotland and caused flooding. Three people died in a train derailment near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire after a night of thunderstorms and torrential rainfall.Query over Cummings role in defence review – MPs are demanding Downing Street clarify Dominic Cummings’ role in the defence and foreign policy review, which is designed to set national security priorities for the next five years. Before taking up his job at Downing Street, Cummings accused the ministry of defence in a blogpost of “continuing to squander billions” on two aircraft carriers, arguing it would be better to invest in swarms of tiny drones. The review has been beset by accusations that it is being driven by Cummings, who has been granted a personal tour of sensitive sites including the SAS headquarters and Porton Down research labs.Read this before the net goes down – Bristol has been named Britain’s broadband “outage capital” with homes losing the internet for an average of 169 hours a year, equivalent to seven full days. The typical UK home that has outages is offline for 29 hours a year, according to a report by Uswitch, the utility comparison site. It says almost 5 million consumers have had a broadband outage lasting more than three hours in the past year. The longest single outage was in Leeds, where it went on the blink for more than 54 hours, while London had the most instances of outages with at least seven over the past year.Economics writer Aditya Chakrabortty describes how the coronavirus crisis has sent Britain plunging into a record recession and what it means for the millions of people fearing for their jobs.

Russia’s coronavirus taskforce said 124 people had died over the last 24 hours, pushing its official death toll to 15,384. Like many countries, Rwanda is finding it impossible to test each of its citizens for the coronavirus amid shortages of supplies. But researchers there have created an approach that’s drawing attention.They are using an algorithm to refine the process of pooled testing, which tests batches of samples from groups of people and then tests each person inidually only if a certain batch comes back positive for Covid-19. Pooled testing conserves scarce testing materials.Rwanda’s mathematical approach, the researchers say, makes that process more efficient. That\\s an advantage for developing countries with limited resources, where some people must wait several days for results. Longer waits mean a greater chance of unknowingly spreading the virus.Ukraine recorded a record daily jump of 1,592 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, the national council of security and defence said on Thursday. The number of infections has increased sharply in Ukraine in the past two months as authorities have eased some restrictions, allowing cafes, churches and public transport to reopen. Health minister Maksym Stepanov urged people to obey broader restrictions that remain in place. “I will insist on strict adherence to all the rules. The situation is very tense,” Stepanov told a televised briefing. The total number of cases rose to 86,140, including 1,992 deaths and 46,216 recoveries, as of Aug. 13. Australia posted its lowest one-day rise in new Covid-19 cases in more than three weeks on Thursday, stoking hopes that a second wave of new infections gripping Victoria state is finally being brought under control. Australia, once heralded as a global leader in combating the virus, has struggled to contain an outbreak in the country’s second most populous state, which has seen triple digit daily new cases for weeks. But Australian states and territories on Thursday reported just 292 new infections in the past 24 hours, down from 4xx the previous day and the lowest since July 20. “We now believe, cautiously, that we have early signs of the flattening of the curve,” Australia’s minister for health Greg Hunt said in a televised media conference. The bulk of the new infections again came in Victoria, which detected 278 new infections in the past 24 hours, down from 410 a day earlier. Hello everyone.

British tourists cancelling trips to France because they may have to quarantine for 14 days on their return might be upset, but the owners – often British too – of the places they had booked to stay are losing more than just a holiday.“For every potential visitor, there’s an owner who depends on that rental for their livelihood,” said Gavin Quinney, who runs a large farmhouse gîte in Créon near Bordeaux and is now staring at a blank late August and a very shaky September.“You can understand people hesitating, for all sorts of reasons. But we’re going to have to work out what the rules are, what’s fair, because there are people who are really suffering from the permanent stop-start uncertainty of this summer.”France is reportedly “on the cliff-edge” of being removed from the British government’s list of quarantine-exempt destinations amid a continuing rise in infections, with a decision expected by the end of the week:New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said Auckland’s Covid-19 outbreak will get worse before it gets better, and warned of extended lockdowns after the country reported the first new cases in 102 days without community transmission. Ardern stressed New Zealand’s approach of going hard early remained their best chance of slowing the spread and urged caution over growing misinformation around coronavirus: Here are the key developments from the last few hours: There are 749,358 known coronavirus deaths globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, as the world nears the sombre milestone of 750,000 dead in nearly eight months since the first coronavirus cases were reported. Two days ago, cases passed the staggering total of 20m. Already, they stand at 20,620,847. India reported another record daily rise in novel coronavirus infections on Thursday, while the death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 47,000, Reuters reports, citing the Health Ministry. Infections grew by 66,999 on Thursday from a day earlier to reach a total of nearly 2.4 million to date, India’s health ministry said.The country, with the world’s biggest case load behind the United States and Brazil, has now reported a jump of 50,000 cases or more each day for 15 straight days.As surging Covid-19 cases across Latin America leave cemeteries and funeral homes struggling to keep pace, engineers in Bolivia have come up with a solution as pragmatic as it is macabre: a mobile crematorium.The five-metre by two-and-half-metre oven is small enough to fit on to a trailer, and is powered by locally produced liquefied petroleum gas – making it a cheap option for families who cannot afford a funeral service.Three canisters of LPG can cremate a body in 30 to 40 minutes, said the mobile crematory’s inventor, Carlos Ayo, an environmental engineer who says he designed the device to help his country in a time of crisis.“We wanted to help in this pandemic, and one possibility was showing others how to make a crematory oven,” said Ayo in a telephone interview.“Then we asked ourselves wouldn’t it be better if it could be mobile, to move it from one place to another?”Ayo said he had received orders from several local councils in Bolivia, where authorities are struggling to deal with the rising death toll. Crematoriums are only found in the country’s main cities, and even then, many Bolivians cannot afford the fees: The survey was completed before Victoria implemented the stage four lockdown in an effort to contain a second wave of coronavirus infections in the state, so the monthly result is likely more rosy than the current reality:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fcc1103e6cb34c25f2a6e4bfa47b8637175603e/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7267a87ee882f769b19c9aa670bec54","title":"uk coronavirus live news covid 19 latest updates","story":"3.4 million infections figure from Imperial College London is far higher than previous estimates“This low rate of contact tracing completion has been a challenge to our capacity to control the community spread of Covid-19 in Blackburn with Darwen,” writes Dominic Harrison in a column in the Lancashire .Welcoming the government’s recent decision to give power contract tracing powers to local authorities, Harrison says the national system just wasn’t good enough, with just three contacts recorded per positive case in Blackburn.Harrison says Blackburn is testing at a rate of 267 per 100,000 – the national average is about 94 per 100,000.Failing to trace the contacts of confirmed cases has hampered efforts to control the spread of the virus in Blackburn, writes Harrison:Yesterday the Department of Health and Social Care reduced the UK’s death toll by more than 5,000 following a review of how figures are calculated.Professor David Spiegelhalter, the Covid data guru from the University of Cambridge, suggests the old way of totting up the deaths was “ridiculous”.Talking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Spiegelhalter discussed how misleading Public Health England’s “daily dashboard” — which listed the number of positive cases and deaths in each area — is.“People have been watching this daily figure and haven’t realised how ridiculous it is,” he said.But he insisted the new calculations do not change the fact “we have done very badly and there has been a very large numbers of death”.Asked whether the previous figures unnecessarily scared the nation into staying at home and not wanting to go back to work, Spiegelhalter said: “I do think on the whole people are rather too cautious, rather too fearful, and the communication hasn’t helped in that.”Around 3.4 million people in England have been infected with Covid-19, a figure far higher than previous estimates, a study suggests.Prof Helen Ward from Imperial College, one of the lead authors, has just been on Radio 4’s Today programme discussing the study, which gave 100,000 volunteers simple finger-prick home testing kits.Asked why the entire population hasn’t been given tests so that we can all find out if we have had coronavirus — a move Boris Johnson once declared a “game changer” — Ward said:The bigger uncertainty actually is: what does it mean? I don’t think it’s a game changer because we don’t know if you have antibodies you are at reduced risk and how long, if you are at reduced risk, that lasts. So in terms of iniduals who have done this test we say: even if you are antibody positive you may still be at risk.Another day dawns and with it our indefatigable coronavirus live blog.

I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity.

But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Photograph: GettyWhat \u0026nbspis the exams debacle in Scotland \u0026nbspand why does it matter here?The furore over the use of calculated grades in Scotland – a system similar to that being used in Ireland – may well be a warning shot of what to expect when results are provided to Leaving Cert students here in the coming weeks.In Scotland, the downgrading of almost 125,000 students’ results based on teachers’ predictions sparked controversy in Scotland.Pupils in the poorest areas were marked down the most.This prompted a public outcry, an apology from Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon and swift reversal of all downgrades earlier this week.All eyes are now on how these issues will play out in Ireland. Many Leaving Cert students and their families are understandably anxious about what will happen.Are there\u0026nbspproblems brewing elsewhere in the UK?Yes. A-level results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to be published on Thursday, which are also on the basis of calculated grades.In England, about 40 per cent of teachers’ grades are reported to have been downgraded by an algorithm – or standardisation process – which relies heavily on the previous results of students and their schools’ performance.After seeing what happened in Scotland – and fearing a similar outcome – the British government announced a last-minute change to allow students appeal the results based on their past performance in mock exams.Could the same\u0026nbsphappen here when Leaving Cert students get their results?There’s every chance. While the models of calculated grades used in Scotland, England and the Republic are different, the core principles are the same: combining teachers’ estimated grades with a national standardisation process or “bell curve”.This process is aimed at ensuring results are similar to previous years. It helps avoid grade inflation and maintains the integrity of end-of-school exam grades.But that is what also happened in Scotland and it backfired spectacularly when applied to iniduals. Politically, there is little appetite for a system where algorithms, rather than humans, determine how students succeed.Why not use teachers’ grades and forget about standardising results?There is plenty of research in the UK to suggest that teacher assessments are less reliable than other forms of assessment.The biggest research study to date on their accuracy is by Dr Gil Wyness of University College London. She found the vast majority – 75 per cent – were overpredicted by teachers.Worryingly, among high-achieving students, applicants from low-income homes were more likely to have their grades underpredicted compared with those from high-income backgrounds.What has Minister for Education Norma Foley to say about all this?She has sought to reassure thousands of Leaving Cert students that the new calculated grades system will be “accurate, reliable and fair to all students”.A spokesman for the Department of Education said the Irish system was developed in close consultation with representative bodies of students, parents, teacher unions, school management and the higher- and further-education and training sector. But Opposition parties say similar assurances were given to students in Scotland prior to the issuing of results.What will happen now?The process of standardising student grades is being worked through by a unit within the Department of Education. Officials say there are several safeguards and validation processes to ensure this is done fairly.For example, they say students will not be penalised by their school’s track record. This is because it will recognise if groups of students taking a subject in a school are academically stronger than previous years based on their Junior Cert results.Is there any solution?This is tricky, complex territory. One possible path forward is to dial down the standardisation process, even if it means students’ grades will be higher than normal.Students who sat their exams in previous years – with lower grades by comparison – could then be treated as a separate group, with a proportion of CAO places set aside for them. Whether there is enough time to devise such a solution is another question."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4328791.1597267442!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"case of covid 19 confirmed at community creche in south dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChildren and staff in one of the Montessori rooms were deemed to be close contacts of a person with the illness and will have to self-isolate and be tested for the virus as a result.

Photograph: Getty ImagesFewer than 1,000 people have been placed in self-isolation at the 750-bedroom Citywest hotel convention centre outside Dublin, which has so far cost the State over €24.5 million since the start of the Covid-19 crisis The figure is revealed in a letter sent by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall, which detailed the use made so far of Citywest, which has room for hundreds of extra emergency beds.Up to July 26th, the Health Service Executive (HSE) said 983 people had been isolated there, with 104 staying there on that date alone. So far healthcare workers have “predominantly” been the ones to isolate there, the letter states.However, the figure is likely to have increased since that date as Citywest has been used for self-isolating meat plant workers who are unable to do so where they are living.The letter notes that “consideration is being given to identifying alternate uses for the facility should occupancy remain low, as the contract cannot be terminated before October”.By June, three months into the seven-month lease, Citywest had cost the State €9 million. However, Mr Donnelly wrote that “the balance of the funding will be required to meet contractual commitments to October”. Under the contract the HSE must given three month’s notice before quitting the lease. Alternative “uses” for Citywest are now being sought “should occupancy remain low” since the contract cannot end before October. CapacityWhen the lease was originally signed at the height of fears about Covid-19, the HSE planned to use Citywest as an emergency hospital if acute hospitals were overrun. However, capacity was never reached. Commenting on the lease, Ms Shortall said “it is hard to understand why the Citywest hotel wasn’t used more extensively as an isolation facility, especially for people in high-risk settings such as direct provision”.“The contract for the Citywest hotel and convention centre is very peculiar too. Why should such a short-term contract require a four-month notice period to end?” So far €84 million has been spent up to July 3rd on testing and contact tracing, 37 per cent of the approved budget of €208 million. This includes €36.8 million for around 447,000 lab tests, and €36 million on capital set-up costs, lab testing equipment, reagent supplies and other equipment.

File photograph: BloombergThe Department of Social Protection has said it will investigate claims made by Siptu of alleged bogus self-employment and sub-contracting in the meat sector.The union alleges employment practices in Irish meat plants are depriving the State of tax revenue and leaving workers without key pandemic-linked illness and unemployment benefits.The claims are contained in an opening statement to be delivered to the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee on Thursday, in which the union calls for an end to the practice of “hot-bedding”, or the use of the same bed by meat sector workers on alternate shifts.More than 40 migrant meat plant workers are sharing “rooms accommodation” in one Midlands town, Siptu isional organiser Greg Ennis will tell the hearing, convened to examine recent large Covid-19 outbreaks in meat plants in the Midlands.Without being registered and having a PPS number, workers are ineligible for enhanced illness benefits or the pandemic unemployment payment.Asked about the claims by Mr Ennis, the Department of Social Protection said on Wednesday night that if the union wished to provide information, it would examine each case.A department spokeswoman said where a worker was posted from abroad, the employer was obliged to notify the Workplace Relations Commission. There have been no such notifications from meat factories in 2020.Travel restrictionsMeanwhile, public health officials have defended the blanket re-imposition of travel restrictions in three Midlands counties following the outbreaks.More than 90 per cent of the workers at the three plants in counties Kildare, Offaly and Laois live in these counties, according to acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn.He was responding to criticism that the measures were too widely spread and could have been limited to the towns where the plants are situated.While agreeing the restrictions were a “blunt instrument”, Dr Glynn said there was a “misperception” that all of the cases were located close to the processing plants where the workers were employed.The restrictions were applied across the three counties for a reason, he said, adding that cases of the virus had occurred in Birr, Ferbane, Clara, Tullamore, Edenderry, Maynooth, Clane, Newbridge, Athy, Durrow and Abbeyleix in recent days.“People work in a particular place but they live and socialise and meet people all across these counties,” Dr Glynn told the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) briefing on Wednesday. He warned people living in adjacent counties to also be on their guard, pointing out “there’s nothing magic about a county border that protects you”. NPHET reported another 40 confirmed cases on Wednesday, including 12 in Dublin, 11 in Kildare, seven in Offaly and none in Laois.However, Dr Glynn warned there were likely to be days over the next week when the number of cases was “significantly higher”.Lower numbersProf Philip Nolan, chairman of a NPHET advisory group, pointed out the 40 new cases “seems low” only when seen through the prism of the large numbers of cases reported over the past week. Wednesday’s caseload was still two to three times higher than the number of cases being reported in late June, he said.The reproduction number, a measure of how much the virus is being transmitted, had dropped from 1.8 last week to an estimated 1.6 this week, he reported.Seventy per cent of cases over the past 14 days occurred in the large Midlands clusters, with fewer than 10 cases a day of community transmission.However, there had been smaller outbreaks in counties Clare, Donegal, Wexford and Carlow, he said.Meanwhile, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the Government’s aim was to “flatten the curve” and to minimise the risk of the health service being overwhelmed until either herd immunity was developed, “which would take an extremely long time” or, more likely, a vaccine was developed.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute responded to reports of a man jumping on cars in Dublin 7Reproduction rate of Covid-19 has fallen slightly this week, from 1.8 to 1.6Research Lives: Prof Mike Zaworotko, Bernal chair of crystal engineering, University of LimerickOireachtas virus group to hear new system will work only if speedy sampling in placeNumber likely to be higher as people opting for certain privacy settings are not includedState to investigate claims by union of bogus employment practices in meat sectorHSA should shut down meat processing facilities where appropriate, groups sayThe facility has so far cost the State over \u0026euro24.5m since the start of the Covid-19 crisisWoman and her elderly mother escape after smoke alarm alerts them to fireRevenue officers also seized 308 litres of smuggled alcoholBritish PM to announce two new groups to mark next year\u0026rsquos centenary of creation of the NorthParents informed by management last Sunday but only contacted by HSE on WednesdayDublin City Council seeks to encourage visitors to boost retail and hospitality sectorsInvestigation \u0026lsquoable to withstand most robust and forensic examination by defence in this case\u0026rsquoCustomers can apply for refund instead of extension, due to Covid-19 impactInquest into teenager\u0026rsquos death to be held in January next yearStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324506.1596782289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gove announces 650m brexit support package for the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove visited Northern Ireland on Friday with Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis.

Photograph:  David HaskellAt a distance Charles Fort in Kinsale looms up from the landscape in shades of grey stone but once you get closer you can see that its surface is actually multicoloured. Lichens crust the walls, including the bright yellow Caloplaca decipiens and the deep black Varrucaria maura. The tops of the walls are home to flowering grasses, mosses and heathers. Rather than a dead artefact it is a living habitat.Of all the organisms now living among the 17th-century walls, the lichens have probably been there the longest. Lichens are an organism made up of fungus and algae and they can live for thousands of years, growing very slowly and regularly. Recognition of their age and their regular growth rate led to the science known as “lichenometry”, pioneered in the 1950s. It uses the growth rate of lichens to determine the age of the surface that they grow on.Movement of glaciersRoland Beschel, an Austrian scientist, first suggested the use of lichens for dating. He had noticed that larger lichens appeared on older glacial moraine (the rocks left behind when a glacier retreats) and proposed that a lichen growth pattern could be used to date the movement of glaciers in the Alps. Lichenometry continues to be an important way to study the retreat of glaciers, especially now in the context of climate changes observed at the poles. Other geological events can be dated using lichens including volcanic eruptions and landslides.Lichenometry has also been extended into the realm of archaeology where it can be useful when radio carbon dating is either not possible or not likely to prove especially helpful.The technique is not without difficulty. Lichen growth rates can be affected by weather changes and the same species will grow differently in different environments (despite the fact that a single species of lichen may be found across the globe). Lichens on a surface may merge with one another, making it difficult to determine the precise size of a single specimen. Fire destroys lichen thereby “resetting” the lichenometric clock. The technique further assumes that a lichen immediately colonised the rock in question, but this may not be true.GravestonesNonetheless, lichenometry can be helpful in dating particular kinds of sites and objects when other methods of dating prove difficult. Unmarked or degraded gravestones are one useful example. A study by Brandy Luthe et al in 2018 used lichen growth to date headstones in a cemetery in Arkansas that was associated with the advance of western settlement.No documentary evidence existed about the establishment of the cemetery and some headstones were not dated. Dated headstones could be used to establish a growth curve for the relevant lichens. Lichenometry (combined with other methods) suggested that the cemetery was founded about 1800, earlier than the dated headstones.The fact that lichens need sunlight to grow is also helpful in dating. For example, a rock that has lichens on a surface not exposed to the sun suggests that the rock has been recently moved. For archaeologists studying Native American sites lichenometry can help to establish how much the form of a wall, for example, has been altered by 21st century hikers or campers moving the stones out of place.In Ireland, lichens have been used by Eoin Halpin to make an argument about the shape of portal tombs. Halpin supports the idea that the tombs were not fully covered with cairn stones by the observation of a lichen “tide mark” on the large stones forming the portal.

Pilots are expected to start again, after being abandoned in the Isle of Wight earlier this year. For months, the NHS promised to produce such a function, but in June officials admitted the plans were not working and instead pledged to work with Apple and Google. These aspects of the model will need to be piloted before being added to the national app.Under the new plans, people will also be able to book coronavirus tests through the app and use it to scan Quick Response codes at pubs and restaurants so patrons can be alerted if other customers test positive. Users may be able to enter personal information about themselves to see their own risk score, taking into account both the infection rate in their own area, and their own vulnerability should they get the virus, because of their age, weight or underlying health conditions.Officials believe such advice might help people to comply with social distancing guidance. Earlier this week health officials announced that the national “test and trace” scheme will be scaled back, under plans to replace thousands of call centre workers with council staff knocking on doors. The major overhaul of the system follows warnings that the service is now reaching fewer than half of contacts of those who test positive for Covid-19. On average, those working for the call centres are reaching just one case a month, research shows.Mass testing and tracing was abandoned in March, and not restarted until the end of May, with the rollout of NHS Test and Trace.On Wednesday, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, criticised the Government for stopping efforts to isolate and trace coronavirus cases. He told MPs: Test and trace should have been in place three months before it was. He said the NHS Test and Trace system in England is not fit for purpose, let alone world class. Mr Hopson said there is an awful lot to do to get the service in place for winter, adding that the research to be published by the body later this week will show NHS leaders are not particularly confident about the system so far.Councils have warned that many of those being called reject attempts to contact them, because they assume that the unfamiliar “0300” number is a cold caller.The changes also follow warnings that the safe reopening of schools depends on improvements in efforts to test and track the virus.  The national service will be reduced from 18,000 to 12,000 contact tracers, amid concern that in recent months, thousands of outsourced workers employed by Serco and Sitel have been sitting idle.  In June, ministers announced that the contact tracing app would be abandoned and replaced, after an audit found it could detect just one in 25 contacts on Apple phones. The programme had been dogged by criticism, with questions for months about why Britain insisted on building its own app, rather than harness the skills of the tech giants. In May, the Prime Minister promised a “world-beating” test, track and trace operation by June 1, as part of efforts to bring Britain out of lockdown. But when the system launched, it was based only on manual tracing, with officials refusing to say when the app would be ready, and describing it as “the cherry on the cake”.When GoogleApple technology was instead used, this rose to 99 percent. However, testing found that in some cases the technology being used by Apple and Google could not differentiate between a phone in a user\u0027s pocket one metre away and a phone in a user\u0027s hand three metres away.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government wont trust teachers should","story":"I should have known it. Molesworth warned us that any skool is a bit of a shambles and masters are not really grown ups they are ha-ha just spoilt children, but did we listen? No. Now Ofqual has unveiled the truth: teachers, suggested Ofqual chairman Roger Taylor in the  on Sunday, are not to be trusted. I’m not sure I agree.In the first half of 2020 we faced flood, fire and pestilence. Now comes a new threat that targets only students: the Government’s regulatory body is downgrading our exam results – for exams that we were unable to sit. Not only do we have no happy sense of closure, no cheerful waving goodbye to those less likeable subjects, no chance to prove our worth in favourite subjects, but now we’re also encouraged to query our teachers’ judgment. Allowing teacher-estimated grades to stand would have resulted in perpetual unfairness between this year’s grades compared to past and future generations, argues Mr Taylor. So what good can come from this? What does Ofqual hope to achieve? If we cannot trust our teachers, who and what can we trust? How can we know for certain that the earth is flat, that πr2 is indeed the equation for calculating the area of a circle and not simply a meaningless squiggle made up minutes before the lesson started? How can we know that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is indeed the cruel dictatorship that our teachers would have us believe, and not simply a wonderful Utopia, ruled over by Kim Jong-Un the Ever-Friendly?Ofqual’s policy seems to be based on mistrust and suspicion, characteristics once viewed as un-British. It’s an unpleasant kind of person who always looks for the worst in people. The Taylor argument assumes teacher guilt, rather than teacher honesty – an unhealthy outlook with only negative implications. I wonder what teaching unions think of this demonising of teachers. Does anyone care about the long-term effects of all this – the further downgrading of teachers’ professional status, not to mention pupils’ disillusionment with school and a wider acceptance that a spiteful, untrusting approach to the world around us is just fine?The decision to moderate teacher-estimated grades ties us firmly to our past weaknesses. We have been denied the chance of a last great push and now we’ll be judged instead on exams that, historically, never mattered. Their very name, mocks, suggests they have no real value. Why, then, base our results on them? Will Ofqual’s grades take into account events that occurred during mocks that would not occur during actual GCSEs – in my case, a timetable clash between my real French oral and my Biology mock? (Funnily enough, I prioritised the French. I assume my teachers took this into account in their predictions, but Ofqual won’t.)We need to ask what message this is sending out. Answer: give up half-way, endings don’t matter, last-minute reversals are impossible. Victory can’t be snatched from the jaws of defeat in the closing minutes of the game. Johnny Wilkinson’s World Cup-winning drop-kick against Australia in 2003 was a waste of time and Henry V’s forces at Agincourt would have been wiser to have surrendered. I think we can all thank our lucky stars that it was Churchill and not Roger Taylor orchestrating the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk. Surely, having done badly in his own A-levels and then been given a second chance, Mr Taylor should know the importance of a late-in-the-day turnaround and a generous-minded system.When we have underperformed at GCSE and A-level, our possible options after school will be more limited: the best universities will be out of our reach, perhaps even our preferred job options, too. It’s hard not to be irritated that next year’s cohort will benefit from the allowances we are denied: a reduced syllabus with less coursework, possibly fewer modules, and there’s even talk of open-book exams. Mr Taylor, you’re in danger of letting us all down. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"grade inflation would devalue a level results covid generation","story":"Inflating the grades of the Covid generation risks devaluing their exam results and harming their future career prospects, the Education Secretary has said.Writing in The , Gavin Williamson said he would refuse to follow Scotland in an about-turn allowing students to be awarded grades predicted by their teachers.On Thursday, thousands of A-level students in England will be given marks calculated by a statistical model which takes into account a range of factors including their performance in earlier tests and previous exam results at their school.However, on Wednesday ministers admitted this will mean that 40 per cent of students are awarded a lower grade than predicted by teachers.Critics have urged the Government to follow the example of Scotland, which this week said students would receive their teachers\u0027 predicted grades. In England, that would see results of up to 12 per cent higher than last year – the highest year-on-year grade inflation since records began in 1951.Mr Williamson said that, if teachers\u0027 grades were used, we would have seen them shoot up, which would devalue the results for the class of 2020 and would clearly not be fair on the classes of 2019 and 2021, adding: But worse than that, it would mean that students this year would lose out twice over, both in their education and their future prospects.It comes as 250,000 students prepare to receive their A-level grades, which will largely be predicted by a statistical model as well as a rank order drawn up by teachers.On Wednesday, Nick Gibb, the schools minister (see video above), said 40 per cent of grades have been lowered from teachers\u0027 recommendations – far more than the 24 per cent downgraded in Scotland.Sources warned that the Government should be braced for the same levels of outrage over grades on Thursday that results day in Scotland had generated last week.On Tuesday evening, Mr Williamson made an 11th hour change to the appeal system which means pupils can now appeal against their grade on the basis of a mock exam results.It was the latest in a series of last-minute alterations to the appeals system ahead of results day and followed the Scottish U-turn that threw Whitehall into a panic about how to head off a similar crisis.John Swinney, Scotland\u0027s education minister, announced on Tuesday that the 124,564 grades that had been downgraded would be withdrawn and replaced with teachers\u0027 recommendations.Meanwhile, the Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, pledged to introduce a safety net with which students would not get a lower A-level grade than their AS mark.Unlike in England, where AS levels were scrapped under a series of reforms to toughen up A-levels, they remain in place in Wales, meaning they can be relied on as an indicator of a pupil\u0027s performance in exam conditions.Ministers have come under pressure to abandon the results algorithm over fears that disadvantaged pupils will fare worse.In Scotland, where teachers\u0027 predicted grades will now be used, the pass rate for Advanced Higher, equivalent to A-levels, shot up by 13.7 percentage points in a year, while the Higher – equivalent to AS-levels – pass rate increased by 14.4 percentage points.A source familiar with the statistical modelling used in the grading process said: There could easily be the same sort of outrage in England as there was in Scotland about grades being scaled back.Given the scale of downgraded marks will be so much bigger here, there is bound to be students saying: \u0027Give us all higher grades too.\u0027 The Government ought to buy an extra strong tin hat for Gavin Williamson and see if he can hold out more than a few days.The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) said it was working urgently to implement the last-minute changes to the appeals process announced by Mr Williamson on Wednesday.Sir Peter Lampl, the chairman of the social mobility charity The Sutton Trust, said this year\u0027s grading is grossly imperfect. He urged universities to make even greater use of contextual offers this year and admit students from difficult backgrounds even if they have narrowly missed their grades.Universities have reportedly reassured ministers that, to reflect the situation, they will “soften” the grades students normally require.Prof Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK, said that vice-chancellors were “seeking urgent clarification from the Department for Education on a range of issues, including the likely scale and timing of appeals”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden set make first appearance running mate kamala harris","story":"Kamala Harris has used her first speech after being named as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee to hammer Donald Trump’s record of tackling coronavirus and speak about her own family’s immigrant backstory.The Californian senator appeared alongside Mr Biden at a campaign event for the first time since the Tuesday announcement as the pair both spoke in Wilmington, Delaware - Mr Biden’s hometown. Ms Harris, 55, said she was “incredibly honoured” to have been selected to join the Democratic Party’s presidential ticket and was “ready to get to work”. Much of the speech was spent going after the Trump administration’s record on handling the Covid-19 crisis, widely seen as one of the central issues in the November 3 election. At another she referenced her past as a prosecutor when criticising the current US president and vice president, saying: “The case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut.Ms Harris criticised Mr Trump’s “delusional belief that he knows better than the experts” and said he had at times pushed “miracle cures he saw on Fox News, an apparent reference to hydroxychloroquine. She said that the plan to reopen schools was in “complete chaos” and that the country’s reputation was “in tatters.   “This is what happens when we elect a guy who just isn’t up for the job,” she said. At other points Ms Harris expanded on her own back story, including being the child of immigrants. Ms Harris’s mother came to America from India and her father was from Jamaica. She described how, after meeting in the United States, the pair got involved in the civil rights movement and that she was sometimes taken to protests strapped a parent\u0027s chest.Ms Harris also spoke about her friendship with Beau Biden, Mr Biden’s eldest son who died from cancer in 2015. Mr Biden had mentioned the connection in a statement announcing his choice for running mate.Ms Harris said that they got to know each other when she was attorney general for California and Beau held the same role in Delaware, saying that they would talk every day during the height of the 200909 financial crisis. As she addressed the strength of bond between Mr Biden and Beau, saying “it was the most beautiful display of the love between a father and a son”, Mr Biden listened on with his head bowed in apparent emotion. Ms Harris had taken to the podium, positioned before a row of flags of all 50 US states, after Mr Biden had given a speech praising Ms Harris’s qualities as a politician and a leader. I have no doubt that I picked the right person to join me as the next vice president of the United States of America, and that is senator Kamala Harris, Mr Biden. He added: “She\u0027s ready to do this job on day one. We\u0027re both ready to get to work rebuilding this nation.Mr Biden said he hoped that young girls of colour were looking at his vice presidential selection - Ms Harris is the first woman of colour on a presidential ticket for a major US political party - and wondering if they could lead the country. He also said of the role Ms Harris would play if she wins the November election: “I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room, to always tell me the truth, and she will, to challenge my assumptions if she disagrees, to ask the hard questions. Because that’s the way we make the best decisions for the American people.At the end of the event the politicians were joined at the front of the stage by their partners but the two couples remained socially distanced from each other, in a reminder of how the pandemic has altered the 2020 election campaign. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"standing stilton exactly ministers should","story":"The eleventh hour had passed. After days of intense negotiations, the UK’s international trade secretary, Liz Truss, was poised to sign a deal that would protect £14.8 billion of the nation’s exports to Japan. Yet no pen was dipped, no contract signed. Instead the Japanese foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, flew back to Tokyo last Friday, doubtless baffled at how the UK had taken a stand, and refused to shift, over a matter of just some 0.007 per cent of total exports to his country.That 0.007 per cent, a mere £100,000 worth of business, related to a few cheeses that might not benefit from tariff-free agreements – in particular softer cheeses such as the blue-veined Stilton.Perhaps up at 40,000 feet, Mr Motegi wondered what on earth all the fuss was about as he looked down at his tray of food, a few delicate pieces of sushi and sashimi, a tiny bowl of soy sauce, some chopped ginger. What a relief that would be after days of heavy Whitehall sandwiches and that other British cultural horror: biscuits and cheese, including that very specimen – a cheese with actual mould deliberately within it.But back in Blighty Ms Truss was being heralded as a hero by Britain’s artisanal cheesemakers I could almost hear the applause at the Nottinghamshire Cropwell Bishop creamery, where some of the nation’s finest Stilton has been produced for 70 years. I have a vast wedge of it myself, and gouged out a spoonful when I heard the news, savouring its epic combination of smooth creaminess and tart tang.The Cropwell Bishop Stilton is one part of a huge rise in British cheesemaking over recent years. From Northampton’s crumbly and creamy Cobblers Nibble to Cornish nettle-covered Yarg, it’s a key part of the great British food renaissance – one championed by Prince Charles, who once remarked that 20 years ago the only decent cheese you could get was Cheddar, adding: “The extraordinary explosion of artisan-made cheeses has been one of the most remarkable things in this country.”British cheese is now exported around the world and often beats the French in international tastings. But the bemusement of Japanese officials underlines some of the fundamental, traditional differences between British and Japanese food culture. Their preference for raw we see as basically still alive. Our fondness for cooked they view as boiled to oblivion. Compared with their nimble use of chopsticks, our keenness on crockery is distinctly uncivilised. They are as baffled by our love of dairy as we are by a map of the Tokyo subway. And they view our non-automated public lavatories as prehistoric.Yet we Brits have come a long way. And so many of us now embrace Japanese culture, particularly the food.I asked a class of kids in Clapham during a lockdown zoom lesson what their favourite food was. “Sushi,” they all chorused. OK, so they were quite posh kids, but there’s barely a shopping centre in Britain today without a sushi bar.So perhaps it’s time the Japanese – lactose intolerances notwithstanding – cast aside their historic aversion to dairy.

A statistical quirk in testing means that Britain may never hit zero cases, even if the virus is wiped out entirely. The reason lies in the large number of false positives that are almost certain to creep in once case numbers drop very low, yet testing remains very high.Testing is never 100 per cent accurate, and scientists must factor in the false positive and negative rates when determining infection prevalence. The problem is, nobody knows what those rates are.The best guess at present is that coronavirus tests pick up around 80-85 per cent of positive cases, and around 99.9 per cent of negative cases.It may be a lot worse than that. In June, the Government Office for Science submitted a paper to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) estimating that the false positive rate may be 2.3 per cent, suggesting that only 97.7 negative cases would be spotted. A recent BMJ review concluded it might be even worse, a five per cent false positive rate. Why does it matter? Well, even at the most optimistic levels, false positives could be hugely skewing the current testing figures.For example, take the current testing rates. Roughly 310,000 tests are being carried out each day at the moment and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests there is a current community infection rate of 0.05 per cent. That means that if testing was perfect, we should be picking up 155 positive cases a day and 309,854 negative cases. Yet with the current false negative rates, we would miss 20 per cent of the positive cases, picking up just 124. More alarmingly, we would pick up 310 false positives, giving a total of 434 reported cases, nearly three times the real positive figure.It also means that the probability of an inidual with a positive test actually being infected would be around 28.5 per cent.The anomaly also means that even if there was no virus in the community at all, we would never fall below 310 cases a day if we were testing at current levels.Prof Carl Henegehan, director of evidence-based medicine, Oxford University, said: “It does matter when your prevalence is very low. At this point if you have a positive test you are more likely not to be infected than to actually have the virus. Your chance of being infected is less than 30 per cent. “The ONS currently cannot estimate prevalence because it does not now know what the false positive rate of PCR testing is. “It looks like we’ll struggle to get out of this. We’re now in a spiral of bad data.”Testing is currently picking up around 1,000 tests per day, perhaps because it is targeting hotspots, rather than the country as a whole. Yet the analysis suggests hundreds of those could be false positives. The problem is so bad that the ONS admitted in a recent analysis of its surveillance statistics that all its positive cases could be false between April 26 and June 28.“Even in a purely hypothetical situation that the virus is not circulating, a test specificity of 99.9 per cent would be associated with an expected number of positive tests that is approximately equal to what we observed over the entire study period,” the ONS said. In a report to Sage on June 3, Dr Carl Mayer and Dr Kate Baker, from the Government Office for Science, warned that Britain was facing a looming false positive problem.“When only a small proportion of people being tested have the virus, the operational false positive rate becomes very important,” they wrote in their report.“Unless we understand the operational false positive rate of the UK’s RT-PCR testing system we risk overestimating the Covid-19 incidence, the demand on track and trace, and the extent of asymptomatic infection.” It might seem purely academic but there are a growing number of reports of false positives from real world scenarios. On July 24 it emerged that only one of seven staff members who tested positive at St Mirren football club actually had the virus. A Motherwell player also was retested and found to not be infected. reader and Leicester resident Andrew Bent, of Stoneygate, tested positive even though his wife, daughter and son all tested negative.“I was staggered to receive the news as I haven’t experienced any symptoms and have been wearing a mask outside for weeks, open parcels with gloves, and have been observing social distancing measures,” he said.“I came to the conclusion that the test result was wrong so went to the mobile test station and received a negative test result.”Yet there is currently no way to amend the original positive result in the NHS testing system and Mr Bent was still contacted by track and trace even after he had re-tested negative.Mark Woolhouse, Prof of infectious disease epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: “This is the public health version of the Prosecutor’s Fallacy where just because a rare event has happened, such as testing positive for coronavirus, we think it can only have one cause. “But at low prevalence we actually face a high probability that other factors can be involved, such as false positives and given the volume of testing we would expect some false positives to occur. “The positive predictive value is much lower where there is not a lot of disease around and for any diagnostic test that is potentially a concern and can lead to misdiagnosis, hence clinicians are very concerned about false positives.”The answer, according to experts, is to carry out follow-up testing and to weigh up other factors, such as symptoms, when determining whether a test is real or not. Prof Sheila Bird, formerly programme leader, MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, said: “The answer to false positives is to repeat swab tests for a sufficient random sample of positives to find out, or to offer antibody tests four weeks after the first positive swab date.“We learn far too little without biological samples and brief self questionnaires for random samples of those quarantined.”Until then, Britain may never reach zero cases and be able to call an end to the first wave of this epidemic because the data will never allow us to. It is said that the truth is a stubborn thing, while statistics are pliable. In the case of coronavirus, however, it seems the statistics are proving intractable and the truth increasingly elastic. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk not match fit post brexit trade talks claims new zealands","story":"Here we are out here in the South Pacific, ourselves and Australia, and we believe we\u0027re totally match fit and ready to go.Once transition finishes at the end of the year, the UK will fall out of the EU\u0027s trade deals with countries such as Japan. While Britain can negotiate trade agreements during transition, which began after Brexit on January 31,  the deals cannot take effect until the UK has left the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union on December 31. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"a levels results students exams mock ucas university latest news","story":"​Grade inflation \u0027would devalue A-level results of Covid generation\u0027 - Gavin WilliamsonCan I appeal my A-level results?

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is freaking HALO! You don’t come out half cocked with a gun this big.”Many people shared the famous quote from Nintendo mastermind Shigeru Miyamoto, wherein he said that a “delayed game is eventually good”, whereas “a rushed game is forever bad”.However, many others also bemoaned the delay, and noted Xbox’s lack of first-party properties to encourage sales when the new console launches.With Sony’s own next-generation console, the PS5, arriving around the end of the year too, some people are speculating that the superior line-up of exclusive games, including Spider-man: Miles Morales, would leave the Series X some way behind, in terms of sales.“No Halo Infinite this holiday season,” wrote one commentor. “Spider-man and PS5 will dominate.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other cast members would include Stanley’s nephew, who is a widower with two small children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week (11 August), Baker revealed that he had been targeted by a racist Instagram account in the wake of the Kickstarter campaign. The account sent him racist slurs, threats and historic pictures of black men being lynched.“You will not get a dollar from me, go ask your precious Black Lives Matter to help you,” one of the messages read.Ellen DeGeneres Show DJ ‘tWitch’ speaks out after ‘toxicity’ claimsQuentin Tarantino and Jennifer Aniston’s 1990s video game rediscoveredThe eccentric life and uncanny artistry of Stanley Kubrick“Your scam show will never happen,” read another extract. “You won’t get any of my white dollars.

Political correctness has grown to become the unhappiest religion in the world.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe argued that while political correctness started out as an “honourable” attempt at a more equitable society, it now embodies the “worst aspects” of religion, such as moral certainty and self-righteousness.Cave added: “Cancel culture’s refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society. Compassion is the primary experience – the heart event – out of which emerges the genius and generosity of the imagination.”He continued: “Creativity is an act of love that can knock up against our most foundational beliefs, and in doing so brings forth fresh ways of seeing the world. This is both the function and glory of art and ideas. A force that finds its meaning in the cancellation of these difficult ideas hampers the creative spirit of a society and strikes at the complex and erse nature of its culture.”Cave concluded the post by asking what essential values people are at risk of forfeiting in the fight for a more equal society.CeeLo Green criticises Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki MinajMiranda Hart woke up face to face with a fox who entered her houseHis comments come a month after a group of 150 writers, academics and activists, including JK Rowling, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, signed an open letter objecting to cancel culture and decrying “a vogue for public shaming and ostracism”.Ricky Gervais also recently called out the phenomenon, saying: “You shouldn’t have to go to court for telling a joke.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Put me on a ventilator and I will be hoarse for the rest of my life. I don’t have much time, I am 72 years old.“This virus can kill you. It can kill me. Kill my chances of pulling on those boots and hitting the road. Kill the chances that any of us in the music community will ever get back to the stage, because we would never put you in danger, never take you and your life for granted.”Nicks, who last released music in 2014, revealed in March that she had been inspired to start writing songs again in lockdown thanks to Harry Styles.“I know you are doing everything you can to help the situation we are all in,” she tweeted.Whatever happened to the one-hit wonder?“I am getting all my paintings and drawings out, listening to music (mostly Harry Styles’ Fine Line) and being inspired by him to write some new songs and poetry.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

It was obvious this was going to be difficult but it’s been weeks or months in the coming,” he said, noting the fallout last week in Scotland where grades were downgraded for students from more deprived areas.Education secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted the system is fair and “robust”.A-level results available online and in-person from nowStudents are now receiving\u0026nbsptheir A-level results\u0026nbspthrough email or by logging into the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service\u0027s online portal, or in person at their school or college.We wish all students receiving their results today the very best of luck.Exams watchdog cancels news briefingEngland’s exams regulator OFQUAL has cancelled its news conference today and instead will be explaining the exam results appeals process at the start of next week, said Gavin Williamson.It has already announced a 2 per cent rise in A* and A grades this year at A-level.Mr Williamson defended the system as “fair and robust”, but admitted that some students will be unhappy with their results.He told Sky News: “I can’t sit here and say that there won’t be a single child in this country who won’t be in a situation of where they have got a grade that isn’t a fair reflection of their work.“That’s why we took the decision in terms of the triple-lock, making sure there is an incredibly robust appeals process, so that youngsters are able to go down that appeals process and get those issues addressed.”Good morning, and welcome to The Independent\u0027s liveblog as we follow the revealing of A-level results for students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland today.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever the impact of Covid-19 means help is urgently needed to protect elephants against an increased threat of slaughter.In 2015 Space for Giants worked with international conservation organisation The Nature Conservancy to establish Loisaba as a conservation trust in perpetuity, protecting a critical habitat for a ersity of endangered species.Covering an area of 57,000 acres in the county of Laikipia, Loisaba has an increasing resident population of elephants, estimated at around 800, as well as an abundance of other fauna, including more than 260 bird species and 57 mammals, such as lions, leopards and cheetahs.Space for Giants supports wildlife monitoring, security and conservancy management in Loisaba, financed by The Nature Conservancy and other donors, including San Diego Zoo. The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the road to inspect the measures schools have put in place.He said: “It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school. It’s much better for their health and mental wellbeing, and obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back full-time in September. It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was denied shelter, clothing, food, not to talk of health care.“He was maltreated by these same people like an animal to the extent that he was feeding on the remnant food of the animals he was tied with and even ate his faeces, until he was rescued by some Human Right activists.“As a result of monstrous and nefarious treatment he was subjected to, he entire lost his senses and behaves exactly like an animal.“What is most surprising is the fact that his father was living in the same house with them while he undergoes this inhumane and savagely cruel treatment.His two evil step mothers, together with his father are currently in police custody, while the  year old Jibril is undergoing treatment and rehabilitation at the Federal Medical Center Birnin Kebbi.

People wouldn’t make dangerous journeysthey had any other choice. The UK hasn’t resettled any refugees since March, but wars and violence continue. What we need is more safe and legal routes.They added: ‘Stronger’ borders aren’t the answer and only puts more lives at risk.Let’s remember we’re all human and have the same rights to le regardless of the country we happen to have been born in.But the tweets massively backfired as MPs piled onto the company, owned by multinational Unilever, for virtue signalling. Foreign minister James Cleverly tweeted back to Ben  Jerrys, quipping Can I have a large scoop of statistically inaccurate virtue signalling with my grossly overpriced ice cream please.Tory MP for Thurrock Jackie Doyle-Price added: Who cares what Ben  Jerry think  Their ice cream isn’t as good as #Rossis anyway. And BBC political journalist, Andrew Neil wrote: Stop posing as some kind of hippy ice cream play. You’re now wholly owned by a massive global conglomerate called Unilever. Perhapsit paid the taxes HMRC thinks you should pay we could afford to accommodate many more asylum seekers.One Home Office source gave a fiery retort to the Twitter spat, telling the BBC: Priti is working day and night to bring an end to these small boat crossings, which are facilitated by international criminal gangs and are rightly of serious concern to the British people.If that means upsetting the social media team for a brand of overpriced junk food, then so be it.Ben and Jerrys was founded in Vermont in  by childhood friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield.In , the firm was sold to Unilever in  for around m , and although Cohen and Greenfields names are still attached to the product, they are not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.Last month, Ben  Jerrys joined the #StopHateForProfit” campaign, and stopped its paid advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the US, accusing the social networks of not doing enough to remove hateful content and misinformation.Ben  Jerrys attempt at intervening in the migrant crisis at the Channel comes after Ms Patel tweeted last week she was working to make the crossing unviable. More than , desperate migrants have made the crossing this year, with dozens more arriving this week.Criminal people smuggling gangs prey on their fear and hopes of finding safe haven in Britain by offering them spots on a dinghy or other small boats to ferry them across the channel. Ms Patel appointed ex-Marine Dan OMahoney as the new small boats commander to cut off the route across the Channel.And yesterday, immigration minister Chris Philp met with French officials to thrash out an agreement on how to tackle the crisis.

Mr Barton told the BBC: The idea of introducing at the eleventh hour a system win which mock exam results trump calculated grades beggars belief.The Government doesnt appear to understand how mock exams work. They arent a set of exams which all conform to the same standards. The clue is in the name mock.Not only are mock exams not standardised but some kids might not have sat them before schools were forced to close in March, Mr Barton warned. In a dramatic U-turn yesterday, Scotland’s education chief John Swinney was forced to allow pupils to be given higher grades based solely on their teacher assessment.Mr Barton said today: If the Government wanted to change the system it should have spent at least a few days discussing the options rather than rushing out a panicked and chaotic response. I think perhaps in response to whats happened in Scotland, what the Government is saying is we need to give another form of appeal to young people. Andwhat that means is they can say point to my mock results, that shows I am better than my final results.So long as thats not automatically guaranteeing that theyre going to get that result, which I think just adds another inequality, then I can understand the thinking there – and I suspect its a Government wanting to show that it too, like the Government in Scotland, is being sympathetic to children and young people in unprecedented times.Research by University College London showed that up to  per cent of predicted grades are an overestimate of exam performance.It also show  per cent of teacher predictions of A-level outcomes from a previous year were inaccurate. Kids waiting to get the results tomorrow said the last-minute frenzy of changes made it more traumatic for them. Kejti Ismail, from Leicester, studies biology, chemistry and mathematics and said she felt the decision has piled on added stress. The -year-old said: Not only have we been off school for around five months, but all the pupils have gone through so much stress at home with the virus and the pandemic. Our results have actually been the last thing on our mind and studying for them because were too stressed to even think.She added: No-one prepares for mocks as much as we prepare for the real exams ... I just think its so unfair.Cheyenne Williams, an -year-old from Barnhill Community High School in north west London, said: I find all of these last-minute changes to be unprofessional and now I feel even more confused and stressed.She also said some students might have cheated on the mock exams: Personally, my school takes mocks really seriously as we take them in an exam hall with invigilator ... however, I do think that other students could still find ways to cheat.For example,they find the mock paper online beforehand ortheir school doesnt supervise mocks as harshly.Schools minister Nick Gibb told LBC this morning that % of grades will have been adjusted tomorrow but mostly by, the vast majority by just one grade.It could mean that thousands will get lower grades than their teachers thought they should get - and potentially causing fresh confusion for universities and schools across the country.Experts have warned it will likely be the kids in the middle of the class who will lose out.Director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham Professor Alan Smithers said: While teachers will generally have a clear idea of the top performers and those who struggle the most, they will be hard-pressed to distinguish those in the middle.Mr Williamson said every kids wants to know they will be treated fairly. He added that the new system would give students a safety net by letting them rely on their mock results for grades. He said: We are creating a triple process to ensure they can have the confidence to take the next steps forward in work or education.“No one wanted to cancel exams – they are the best and fairest form of assessment, but the disruption caused by Covid- meant they were not possible.“This triple lock system will help make sure that we award the fairest results possible and reassure our young people and help them get on with the next stage of their lives.”The Labour party jumped at the opportunity to urge No to change its position after the chaos in Scotland. Leader Sir Keir Starmer warned that the lives of hundreds of thousands of youngsters could be blighted because “the computer says no”.He said: The SNP have been forced into a humiliating U-turn after a shambolic few days.“With  hours before results are released, I would urge the Prime Minister to change course, or he risks robbing a generation of their future.”Whitehall sources insisted computer moderation would not be scrapped but allowing mock gradeshigher would give pupils extra protection.An extra £million will be handed to schools to fund resit exams in September for pupils unhappy with their marks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which depicts a happy family - was actually a nightmare to plan because his sons blew hot and cold with their dad.Yesterday it was claimed Princess Eugenie was left upset after Meghan Markle and Prince Harry broke the news they were expecting a baby at her wedding.Meghan and Harry told friends and family that the duchess was pregnant at Eugenies big day at St Georges chapel at Windsor in October .The books authors wrote in the biography: A source said [Princess Eugenie] told friends she felt the couple should have waited to share the news.It comes as the biography claimed that Harry felt like he and Meghan had been thrown under a bus to protect members of the Royal Family.It was claimed the -year-old got upset as his reported feud with brother Prince William was played out publicly.A source told authors Omid Scobie and Caroline Durand: Harry was upset that it was playing out so publicly and that so much of the information being reported was wrong.There had been moments where he felt people working with his brother had put things out there to make William look good, evenit meant throwing Harry under the bus.It was a confusing time, and his head was all over the place—he didnt know who or what to believe, and he and William werent talking enough either, which made everything a lot worse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in amongst the gloom there are some glimmers of growth.“Now is the time for everyone to rally round and really fire up the economy together.“Whether it’s going back to school or work in the office again, going to your local restaurant or pub for a meal or visiting your local shops for a bit of retail therapy,we all play our part we can relight our economic firepower together.“I know that businesses around the country have taken extraordinary steps to make sure everyone can do so confidently and safely.”The Tory big gun added: “This country has faced adversity before and come out stronger and I believe this time will be no dferent.”Mr Sunak said people should “safely” head back to work, shops and restaurants.He added: “As people get back to going shopping or going out for a meal or indeed getting back to their office they will see that it’s a new normal . . . a safe normal.“We have made changes, guidance is there to ensure that safety, and they shouldn’t be too nervous about the virus.”The Chancellor said the economy was better protected by “a new safer environment”.And he stressed: “We want to try and protect as many jobs as possible. That comes from as much of our economy ing to normal as possible.”Top economists welcomed the growth in June, which is likely to have continued in July and August.Julian Jessop, from the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “The real news is not that the UK fell into recession in the second quarter of the year. That much we knew.“Instead, it is that the recovery that began in May accelerated in June as lockdown began to be lted.“Of course, there is still a long way to go before these green shootsthe economy to where it was before the pandemic struck. But mighty oaks grow from little acorns.” He added: “People now need to be encouraged to come off furlough and get back to work as soon as possible — whether this is for their existing employer or for another business that is better able to cope with the ‘new normal’, whatever that may prove to be.”Jonathan Athow, of the Office for National Statistics, said: “The economy began to bounce back in June, with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and house-building continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.”Labour’s shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused the Government of mishandling the crisis as figures suggested the largest crash in Europe and the G group of nations.She said: “We’ve already got the worst excess death rate in Europe — now we’re on course for the worst recession too.”But last month she admitted the UK had a “service heavy” economy and was likely to be hit harder from lockdown than other nations.A government source accused the Labour chiefs of “playing politics”.British families are each £, worse off after the Covid- lockdown, new figures show.The Resolution Foundation, the think tank that focuses on living standards, calculated the wealth hit per family so far. Today, official figures confirmed that the economy shrank by an unprecedented . per cent in the second quarter.This was as measured by gross domestic productor output.GDP is often used to represent a country’s wealth.Not only is the UK formally in recession. It’s in the deepest recession in UK history, the deepest of any G economy, and the deepest since the invention of Gross Domestic Product. There’s a glimmer of hope buried in the grim data, though. In June, when the Government began to loosen lockdown restrictions, the economy grew an astonishing . per cent. That’s the biggest month-on-month jump since records began. It’s clear that we DO stand a chance of a relatively swt economic recovery - but onlyBrits start going about their pre-Covid lives sooner rather than later. And with hospital cases down  per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. Of course Covid isn’t over and we can’t be complacent. But Government scientists are attracted to long-term lockdowns because they’re trained to think about public health in the narrowest possible terms. The rest of us, though, understand that in the long run, mass poverty and unemployment kills just as surely as any disease.It’s time to get Britain working.The massive hit to output in the three months to June was £billion — or roughly £, per family.The Federation of Small Businesses is calling for a cut to NI contributions, a revamp of business rates and the “most pro-business Budget ever” in the autumn.The Institute of Economic Affairs believes the key to a strong recovery will be the continued lting of the lockdown — particularly the reopening of schools.  GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It looks good on the CV.I say “results” — of course, they are not results, as such. Instead, teachers have been tasked with deciding how well each student might have donerequired to sit an exam. These predictions are then weighted by the exam boards.As you might expect, teachers tend to overrate the abilities of their students. Not least because it makes THEM look good. In Scotland, they were over-generous to the tune of  per cent — and even more so in some “deprived” areas.The Scottish schoolkids were pretty hacked off to find their grades reduced by the boards, and moaned about it. So the Scottish government caved in and let them have their original grades. The ones that were overvalued.And so when little Jimmy proudly displays his long list of As and Bs to prospective employers — or, God help us, a university — people will just snigger.They know he can’t spell his own name or, like the rabbits in Watership Down, count past five. Nobody will take the results seriously after the Scottish government did its cowardly U-turn.Sadly for the youngsters, they will be pretty meaningless results. Which is a horrible thing to say after they’ve been studying for so long.South of the border we’re doing things a little better. Kids will be able to take the grade awarded to them. Or they can choose to use the result they got in their mocks — exams taken before Mr Covid arrived on the scene. Or they can take a special written exam in the autumn.That’s more sensible. But I suspect, even so, that employers and the universities will be a little wary of taking the results at face value. They will have their doubts.All of this has happened because we’re trying to be kind to the kids. And the reason we’re being kind is because these past six months we have let them down badly. The Government has let them down — and even more so, the teachers.Too many schools had no virtual classrooms at all during lockdown. The kids might have been sent a few worksheets. But time with their teachers was non-existent, even via Zoom.Too many teachers have been absolutely bone idle. Two-thirds of children have taken part in no virtual lessons whatsoever. Schools refused to make them — so the kids skived. And that’s in schools where there WERE regular virtual lessons.My own child, a girl of , completed five physics papers during lockdown. And being my daughter, sent them to the wrong email address. Nobody checked, nobody cared.The truth is our kids have had six months of doing nowt. Being nice to them now because we ignored their needs through spring and summer is all well and good. But it does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of the teaching unions. Nor the failure of the Government to stand up to the unions.The result of all this will be a bigger ide than ever between poorer and richer kids. The middle classes are flocking to the private sector — where schools WILL be open and there’s always a full timetable of virtual work.For the rest — just the suspicion that they have been treated very badly indeed. By the people whose responsibility it was to look after them.It’s time Labour came clean about our teachers. Do they want the schools to reopen or not  And no more weasel words about keeping everybody safe. You cannot eliminate risk entirely, as Sir Keir Starmer well knows.We are now in a recession. Nothing will drag us out of it more quickly than the schools reopening, full-time, no s nor buts. Then the rest of us can get back to work.THE former boss of McDonald’s is in trouble for having exchanged nude pics with fellow workers.Brit Steve Easterbrook, pictured with Alesha Dixon at the London  Olympics, is also in trouble for having slept with a few colleagues.Now, those pics.I don’t knowSteve has a Whopper, a Quarter Pounder, a Big n’ Tasty – or just a chicken nugget. But nobody complained about them at the time. All of his relationships were consensual. And Steve was a orcee. What seems to me wrong is McDonald’s banning all of its staff from having relationships in-house.I WONDER how Prince Andrew has been coping during this heatwave If you remember, he explained to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that he has an inability to sweat. Just can’t do it. He must be bursting, underneath his skin. Perhaps he will explode.Me, I’m sick of sweating. A three-minute walk to the local river ends up with me looking like I’ve just swam a mile in it.I’ve even started wearing shorts, which I hate. The noncey scout leader look – it’s all the rage.The BBC was worrying about this hot spell. Wonderedit was the result of global warming.Isn’t it something to do with that thing called “summer” I seem to remember it kind of happening before, you know I’m talking about the people who, in the middle of a global pandemic, travel abroad for their holidays. And are then surprised there are problems on account of the fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic.Truth is, I have about as much sympathy as I do for people who travel to appalling war-torn countries for their hols then whine at the British Government to get them out.Would it hurt THAT much just to stay in the UK this summer WEDNESDAY was a pretty bad day for grouse.They have it circled in their diaries each year, in red. The “Glorious Twelfth”. This is when City boys and braying toffs take to the grouse moors and start blasting away at anything that moves. Especially grouse. Slow, heavy birds. Not very bright. Hard to miss them from eight yards with a -bore, evenyou’re a halfwit.It’s a bad day for the rest of us, too. And for our countryside. Grouse moors take up an astonishing eight per cent of our land. And yet they are kept solely for the grouse and the , or so numpties who try to shoot them every year.As a result, these moorlands are almost entirely devoid of wildle. Just barren deserts full of heather and nothing .And the gamekeepers burn the heather every spring – just when any songbirds might be nesting. The rest of their time is taken up shooting or trapping our most beautul and endangered birds of prey.Gamekeepers have almost wiped out our hen harriers, for example. Those moors should be teeming with le. Andthey were they’d be a much more attractive proposition for tourists – who would really bring money in to the local communities.Why do we preserve eight per cent of our land for the benefit of just . per cent of our population  Just so they can wear tweed for a day and pretend they’re Carlos The Jackal Probably end up glowing like one of those light sticks kids have on Bonfire Night. One expert reckoned that a side-effect was swelling up until you’re the size of the Kremlin.In the US, President Trump was suggesting swallowing disinfectant as a cure.

There are very few things better than fresh fish and really good chips by the seaside. When it’s done right it absolutely sings.”For the Ready Steady Cook favourite the emphasis should be on “texture and flavour”.He adds that the best examples have: “Sweet, rich fish coated in thin, crispy batter. Chips not too crispy and not too soft.And all of it heavily seasoned with salt and vinegar and a squeeze of lemon. I like mushy peas and tartare sauce, not ketchup.”Nick says location is also an important factor.He adds: “I’d be sitting on a big beach with a grandstand view of the ocean and Mrs Nairn by my side, eating one of the finest meals in Britain. Fish and chips by the seaside, what’s not to love.”With quarantines making international holidays less appealing, Judy Cogan asks Nick to cast his eye over some of the best seaside chippies . . .WHAT a plaice! This has been family run for  years and locals and tourists still queue down the street on Saturday nights for its fresh, battered fish and chips fried in beef dripping.Nick says: “Frying chips in beef dripping is actually quite healthy. They absorb slightly less fat and natural is always better than processed.“The best chips are cooked in beef fat.”ENJOY traditional cod or line-caught haddock looking out over Lyme Bay.The speciality dish is the Cod Royale , a fillet of cod topped with smoked salmon and cooked in batter.Nick says: “The rich flavour of smoked salmon together with cod in batter sounds like a winning combination.“It’s very innovative, I don’t think I have ever heard of that before.”OWNERS the Smiths trace their roots in the fishing industry back to the s and specialise in Scottish haddock in a “secret recipe” batter.Fish is caught daily and filleted on site. They serve a slice of bread from a local award-winning bakery with every order.Nick says: “It’s one of the most popular spots in Fe and I’ve been many times. Fe is a great area for potatoes.”THIS tiny seafront takeaway serves fresh fish filleted on site and chips hand cut from Maris Pipers.A veggie section offers cheese and broccoli nuggets. Nick says: “For me, small is beautul when it comes to chippies and a shack on the beach is Instagram gold these days.“I like that it caters for vegetarians because most don’t.

Luckily we had the windows closed.”TOUTED locally as the best chippie in town, it is known for its friendly service and gluten-free batter. Chips are currently made from seasonal new potatoes.Nick says: “New potatoes are new to me. It’s good to see seasonal interests at the heart of a business.“Blackpool is an iconic seaside town so fish and chips on the promenade sounds great to me.”NOT far from Tenby’s North Beach, this traditional chippie takes pride in its gluten-free batter, made on site from ground rice and potato and fried in its own special fryer.It only uses local ingredients. Nick says: “One thing I would look for in a really good fish and chip shop is locally sourced fish.“And I like that it separates its gluten free fryer from the main fryer.”THIS shop constantly refines its menu, cooking techniques and ingredients to ensure top-notch fish, mainly cod and haddock.It won the Good Catch Sustainable Seafood Award in . Nick says: “That’s a high award in the fish and chip world.Haddock is very sustainable and, for me, it’s one of the best fish on the planet, but it’s got to be spanking fresh.”EXPECT hearty portions of sustainable fish at this warm cafe inside an old, traditional fisherman’s hut on the beach.Nick says: “This sounds idyllic. A fisherman’s hut on the beach where you can watch the boats that caught your fish. That’s hard to beat.“And it’s licensed, so you can enjoy a glass of wine with your fish and chips while looking out to sea. What could be finer ”CELEBRITY chef Rick Stein once said this seafront cafe, “opened my eyes to how good a fish shop could be”.It has been operating since  and attracts long queues thanks to its secret recipe batter and tartare sauce.

Some species breach out of the water, but not typically this kind - they usually hang out in the water column or look for food on the bottom of the seafloor.She was a bundle of energy and could sense I wanted to get a perfect split shot selfie.Usually stingrays are bottom dwellers, meaning they find food along the sandy bottom of the seafloor, so it was awesome to see her launch out of the water. You don’t see that behavior often.Cassie, who is an Underwater Photographer, Expedition Leader and Equestrian Show Jumping Groom said stingrays in the area are friendly with humans due to them often being fed small tidbits.According to Cassie, the wild stingrays are used to humans and come swimming over - pushing themselves up out of the water in search for food - as soon as they hear a boat pull upAlthough not all stingrays are quite as friendly, with one killing Australian zookeeper and wildle expert, Steve Irwin, in .Cassie added: All wild and domesticated animals can be dangerous. Stingrays have a defense mechanism in their barbed tail, but they usually only use it when they are under extreme stress, orthey feel they are being threatened.Of course we need to respect wildle and all animals at all times, as anything can happen at any time.It is important to constantly be aware of these risks, your behaviour in the water, aware of the animals’ behaviour, and other external and internal factors that can cause stress to the animals we interact with.I always say we need to remember to always “expect the unexpected” - after all, the ocean is their home, not ours. We are just visitors.A split shot is the hardest image to master, so I honestly just got lucky with it, perfect timing and the perfect waterline, and focus - it takes a lot of practice to get images like that but it also takes a little luckAfter she came up out of the water like that, I wasn’t sureI nailed it. Split shots are so dficult to capture correctly and there are a lot of factors that have to work to make it happen.After she plopped back into the water, I gave her a small piece of dead fish to thank her for posing with me and checked the LCD of my camera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but it is most frequently used after results day by people who have just missed out on their grades.It remains open until September and the idea is that you identy courses, which still have spaces, that interest you and then you contact them directly.Unlike applying before Clearing, you’ll only be able to add a choice after you’ve submitted your application.You still need to register on Track and make an application as you did when you originally applied.This must be done in the same way and include that dreaded personal statement.After youve done this you should receive an email from Ucas which will give you a clearing number and how to access your new Track account.Once your Track status switches to You are in clearing or clearing has started then youre good to go on to the next step.To start with it is wise to contact the university you originally applied to to talk about your situation and seethey are willing to take you on under the circumstances regardless.At this stage you should also seek some advice from someone you know about other options and have a search for courses that could work better for you.Go and speak to your school careers adviser, a parent or a friend or relative whos been through the process to get an idea of what youre in for.If you definitely do not have a place at your original choice then the next thing to do is to check what courses are available that work to your strengths, or that your grades might be better suited to.Before you add a clearing choice in Track, you need to call the uni and give them your Clearing number , and Personal ID, so they can look up your application.Only add a Clearing choice once you have permission from the university or college.Ucas will have an official vacancy list on its website which is updated regularly.Some positions may become vacant later so KEEP CHECKING.Once youve found out the courses and universities you like the look of and have availability pick up the phone and give them a call.Once you get in contact with someone who can offer you a place give them your clearing number and Personal ID number which will let them see your application online.Talk to the person about the course and the university and asktheyll accept you.Once youve made up your mind which one you want to accept go back to your UCAS profile and click Add clearing choice.Then pop in the details of the course by the date they gave you an offer over the phone.You can only add one at a time butthey arent confirmed by the uni you will be able to add more.Once youve done all that and youve had your offer accepted you are good to go."},{"url":null,"title":"mocks exams a levels change","story":"Late last night the Government confirmed new plans for a triple lock on exam grades to stop thousands of kids being marked down unfairly like the shambled which happened north of the border last week.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesScottish Highers results descended into chaos after , pupils received lower grades than what they were predicted thanks to moderators marking kids down below their teacher-assessed grades.There was uproar as poorer students were marked down more than their richer peers because it takes into account the schools overall performance.And disadvantaged kids are more likely to have done better in their final exams, and less well in coursework.Yesterday the Scottish Government u-turned and said they would cancel all the changed grades andto the teacher-picked ones instead.The move caused panic in England and Wales as the Government feared a similar situation.Now students will either get to pick the highest of either their moderated grade, their teachers prediction, or they can choose to sit the exam in the autumn instead.The current system will take teachers predicted grades and standardise them and moderate them using computers.But Nick Gibb told LBC this morning that % of grades will have been adjusted tomorrow but mostly by, the vast majority by just one grade.It could mean that thousands will get lower grades than their teachers thought they should get - and potentially causing fresh confusion for universities and schools across the country.However, they can choose to pick their mock exam as their final gradeits higher than what the model gave them.It came as:No exams were sat this year thanks to the coronavirus crisis.Mr Gibb defended the system and stressed it would be robust and fairHe told BBC Radio : We are not apologetic for looking, at every stage,  even at the th hour, for systems we can use to make the system as fair as possible for young people.He stressed that the changes will only affect a small group of people and most people will get the correct grades they deserve the first time around.He added: We want to make sure that every young person gets the grades they deserve.We are sticking with the system we have provided - we are not getting rid of it.We think its robust and very fair.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that the new plan could create massive inconsistency among pupils.He told BBC Breakfast: I suspect its a Government wanting to show that it too, like the Government in Scotland, is being sympathetic to children and young people in unprecedented times.He added: The idea of introducing at the eleventh hour a system in which mock exam results trump calculated grades beggars belief.Schools and colleges have spent months diligently following detailed guidance to produce centre-assessed grades only to find they might as well not have bothered.Universities are being urged to be flexible with students who dont get their predicted grades this year during the pandemic.Some are taking students from January to allow pupils to sit exams in the autumn.However, without standardizing some of the grades, Mr Gibb warned there would have been a  per cent rate of inflation from last year - which may have made some qualications rated worthless.One source told the Daily Mail: “in Scotland there are now students walking around with inflated grades that no one will take seriously.”Labours shadow education secretay Kate Green said today the announcement was papering over the cracks.She added: I feel for students affected by this chaos.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ministers will finally change the law after losing a legal fight, to give grieving couples the same rights in future as those who wed. But there is still no date for the change, which it’s thought will help around , bereaved partners a year. And it will only apply to “cohabiting” couples who have children, not those without kids or who live apart.Mum-of-four Siobhan McLaughlin, who won a Supreme Court victory over the policy in , demanded the government set a date before more parents die of coronavirus.She told the Mirror: “Every day it’s another step and they’re letting down our children.

She appealed to the orced Prime Minister - whose partner Carrie Symonds gave birth to their son Wilfred in April.“ Boris Johnson had his brush with death when he had Covid-,” she said.“I wonder, when he was recovering, did he see the irony that his newborn son could quite easily have been in the same position as my four children ” Spouses or civil partners who lose their partner before pension age can claim a Bereavement Support Payment.  It is worth up to £,, plus £ a month for  months. But couples had to be married or in a civil partnership to qualy. Similar rules in Widowed Parentaposs Allowance were defeated in the Supreme Court in . In February this year the High Court then also struck down the marriage rule in BSP, which replaced the old benefit in . Mr Justice Holman said the scheme breached human rights adding: The child cannot make the choice between marriage and cohabitation. The government has now confirmed it will extend the scheme in an answer to an MP’s written parliamentary question.  Employment Minister Mims Davies said: “It is our intention to take forward a Remedial Order to remove the incompatibilities from the legislation governing Widowed Parent’s Allowance and Bereavement Support Payment by extending these benefits to cohabitees with children.

Ministers were accused of ‘closing the stable door after the horse has bolted’, six months into a crisis which has caused the deaths of tens of thousands and left Britain facing the worst recession on record. Department of Health and Social Careofficials will interview internal applicants for the “newly created and high-profile” job, which comes with a salary of up to £,, in the first two weeks of September. According to the advert, posted on the Government’s internal system, the successful applicant will be expected to implement lessons learned from Covid-, including reviewing our approach to pandemic procurement and stockpiling. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted there were “dficulties” in securing a sufficient supply of personal protective equipmentin the early weeks of the pandemic. He came under fierce attack over shortages of masks, gowns and other essential kit - and has promised to build the NHS stockpile in case of future outbreaks. Labouraposs Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said: We needed Government to be prepared to face a pandemic but this feels like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.” He added: “Itaposs very clear now how ill prepared the nation was at the outset and how they failed to heed the warnings from numerous exercises. “The government was too slow into lockdown, too slow on PPE and too slow on testing - this is just another example of the Tories playing catch up with what is required. A DHSC source said many aspects of the new role were already being performed by ious civil service teams. But the team has been “expanded to ensure our preparedness for all types of pandemic threats is robust and comprehensive.”  The Department of Health and Social care said it was standard practice to learn lessons and implement them after a major response. A spokesperson said: “This is not a brand new role - we have had an experienced pandemic preparedness team in place for many years who have covered these responsibilities across a number of dferent posts. “This simply reflects an expansion and merging of dferent teams.” The job is advertised at Grade  of the civil service scale - several rungs below the most senior departmental roles. It will sit within the Emergency and Health Protection Directorate, which the ad says plays a vital role in preparing for and responding to all types of national incidents, such as disease outbreaks or terrorist attacks. It will also involve providing policy leadership across the health and care system to prepare for future infectious disease threats. They will operate in addition to an existing team working on preparations for a flu pandemic - instead concentrating on potential outbreaks of Ebola, MERS and SARS. And they will be expected to develop major cross-government exercises” - simulations to test for weaknesses in the system. In May, a report from one such Whitehall exercise condemned the UKaposs insufficient preparedness for a pandemic like Covid-. The analysis, based on a  simulation of a flu pandemic and codenamed aposExercise Cygnusapos, identied major issues with how well prepared the government was.

The -year-old Senator blamed the US President for the vast coronavirus death toll - saying he pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. She added: While other countries were flattening the curve, he said, the virus would just–poof–go away. This virus has impacted almost every country, but thereaposs a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation, she said. Itaposs because of Trumpaposs failure to take it seriously from the start, his refusal to get testing up and running, his flip-flopping on social distancing and wearing masks, his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts.All of that is the reason that an American dies of COVID- every  seconds.  In a sharp jibe at the billionaire President she added: Trump is also the reason millions of Americans are now unemployed. He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything  he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground. Harris said Biden had recognised the critical moment being faced by the country by picking her to be the first black woman and Asian American on a major-party US presidential ticket. Biden was the former vice president under President Barack Obama. Today, he takes his place in the ongoing story of Americaaposs march toward equality and justice as the only person who served alongside the first Black president, and has chosen the first Black woman as his running mate,aposapos said Harris, a US senator from Calornia. Nearly nine out of  Democrats approved of Harris as Bidenaposs pick, according to a poll.The running mates were forced by the coronavirus pandemic to stage a more subdued launch on Wednesday than would be expected. But they managed to display a personal connection that dates back to Harrisapos friendship with Bidenaposs son Beau, who died of cancer in . Harris said she had long admired Bidenaposs commitment to his family and country. She described him as ready to meet the challenges created by Trumpaposs failures in handling the pandemic and its economic consequences, as well as racial unrest.  This is a moment of real consequence for America, she said. Everything we care about - our economy, our health, our kids, the kind of country we live in - itaposs all on the line. America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him, a president who is making every challenge we face even more dficult to solve, Harris said. The speech, delivered in a Delaware high school gymnasium near Bidenaposs home, featured no cheering crowds. The two candidates wore masks as they arrived and kept their social distance on a stage flanked by state flags.  The joint appearance came just days before Biden will formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination at next weekaposs party convention, which will take place largely as a virtual event due to Covid-. The Republican convention, where Trump is set to be nominated to seek a second four-year term, follows a week later and kicks off a -week sprint to Election Day on November . In choosing Harris, Biden selected a former rival for the nomination.  Her most memorable campaign moment came during a televised debate when she criticised his past position on using busing to integrate schools and talked about its effect on her as a little girl. On Wednesday, Biden said her addition to the ticket sent a powerful message to girls across America. This morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up - especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities - today, just maybe, theyaposre seeing themselves in the first time in a new way.  As the stuff of presidents, and vice presidents, Biden said. In recent months, as unrest has convulsed many US cities following the May police killing of George Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis, Harris has been a prominent voice calling for change. She has marched alongside protesters and pushed legislation to reform policing practices. Some activists have said her work in the Senate had helped temper concerns about her past as a prosecutor in Calornia and could build enthusiasm among some of the partyaposs liberal voters for the more centrist Biden.  Harris is the daughter of immigrants, her mother from India and her father from Jamaica. On Wednesday, Harris recalled her parentsapos involvement in the US civil rights movement, and her friendship with Beau Biden, who was attorney general of Delaware when Harris was attorney general in Calornia. She stressed that, like Biden, my family means everything to me. Harris, , was announced as Bidenaposs choice on Tuesday after a selection process that drew extra scrutiny due to Bidenaposs age. The -year-old would be the oldest president everhe wins, raising speculation that he would not seek re-election in . At a joint fundraiser with Harris later on Wednesday, Biden said his campaign had raised  million and had , new contributors in the  hours since he revealed his pick. Trump told reporters at a White House news conference that he had watched some of the Biden-Harris rollout event and was surprised his Democratic opponent had chosen someone who failed in her own presidential bid.

While two years have passed since they met, Kate cannot shake the feeling that she allowed the love of her le to slip through her fingers. Adam told Kate he was originally from Wales and was in Plymouth to see his friend Mac. She believes he was in his s. Kate also believes he is in the military and may have been part of the Royal Marines. I know there’s a chance Adam may not be single anymore but I thought it’s best that I at least try, she said. We met April ,  at Rust and Royal, we stayed there for a while and then went to a club in the Barbican, and then a diner at the end of the night and parted ways. He kissed me goodnight and we were planning on seeing each other the next day. When a text never came I started to realise I never put my area code in with my number in his phone.Kate has now created an Instagram account called  helpkatefindadam and uploaded a picture of herself and a friend on the night she met Adam, alongside his friend Mac.She has also messaged Rust and Royal to seethey recognised Mac, who Kate had a photograph with. She said that she hoped whoever saw the messaged believed in fairy tales and love at first sight andnot, she could just be the crazy American girl trying to find Adam. Unfortunately the staff did not have any answers. She wrote: Hey!  My name is Kate and this is going to sound crazy, but I was at your bar about two years ago and I met two really fun guys named Mac and Adam. I was there with a group of friends on a Navy supply ship that was in port for a few days and we came to your bar the first night we were in Plymouth. We met Mac and Adam and Adam really fancied me. We instantly had sparks fly and enjoyed a few drinks at Rust Royal. He was in town visiting his buddy Mac, who lived nearby. This may be a shot in the dark, but because I had a few drinks I failed to properly give my phone number to Adam. And unfortunately never saw him again.

Thunder storms and torrential rain caused the mobile homes to slide down a hill, sparking a huge emergency service presence. The landslide happened at Pettycur Bay in Fe, Scotland last night. Shocking snaps showed caravans had crashed into one another as they slipped down the slope of the holiday park, Daily Star reports. Glen McGill was one of the hundreds who was evacuated from his holiday home during the incident. He said: “We had hours and hours of the most horrendous lighting and heavy rain from at least pm to am. Were you one of those evacuated  Email webnews@mirror “I’ve never seen anything like it. No gaps between lighting– more like constant flickering like an electrical outage.” The landslide even blocked part of the nearby railway and even shut the A between Kinghorn and Burntisland. Officers urged drivers to avoid the area as emergency services worked to reopen the road.  Captioning photos that were uploaded in the early hours of the morning, Glen said: “We’ve just been evacuated from our caravan due to danger of landslip. “One along from us is already slipping. No sleep tonight as road out blocked both ways.” He then added: “All caravans now being evacuated at Pettycur. “Main road blocked to either side with landslips though Burntisland side might be passable for emergency vehicles.  “A lot of mud and a few vans where they shouldn’t be. Just hope the ground isn’t any more unstable.” Thankfully, it is understood that no one was injured in the landslide.

South East Water has warned that their demand – which was a record million litres last Friday more than  million litres more than normal – is not sustainable. A hosepipe ban has not yet been issued by the water firm but urged customers to not use sprinklers, hoses and jet washers and to only use water for “drinking, hygiene and cooking.” But Mims Davies, Conservative MP for Mid Sussex, blasted the firm not bringing in a ban quicker after parts of her constituency and growing areas of East Sussex have little or no water - with some households being cut off for six days. She said: “Why on earth can’t this have been part of a clear action plan to support those down the system with absolutely no water. We are in a sixth day.” At least  households in West Sussex have had no tap water since Friday – and others have had intermittent supplies during the heatwave. Gary Walker, from Warninglid, Mid Sussex, said he has been forced to manually remove waste from the toilet and bury it in the garden.

Hereaposs some top tips from the experts to keep babies and children cool and safe during the hot weather. Don’t cover the buggy Parents often put a blanket or cover over their babyaposs pram in the hope it will keep their child out of the sun, but a paediatrician has warned it could actually heat up the buggy like a thermos. News outlet Svenska Dagbladet tested the theory and found a buggy without a cover reached C, but when a cover was applied temperatures rocketed to C. Check their bedding The NHS advises keeping nightwear and bedclothes to a minimum for young children. Remove heavy bedding and do not cover your child when itaposs hot. It states: If your baby kicks or pushes off the covers during the night, consider putting them in just a nappy with a single well-secured sheet that will not work loose and cover their face or get entangled during the night.  Put ice in your babyaposs room Freezing bottles of water and placing them in your childaposs room at night can help to cool the air as they melt overnight.Placing them in front of a fan will also help lower the temperature of the air circulating the room, as reported by The Sun.Never leave them in the car Temperatures can soar in cars in an instant so never leave them alone in a vehicle for any amount of time, no matter how quick you plan to be. Also try to limit long drives and use plenty of breaks to cool off. Use flannels to cool them down Soak a flannel in cool water and dab it on your childaposs head and hands to help reduce their temperature. You can also give them a slightly cooler bath before bed to refresh them, but make sure itaposs quick to ensure they donapost get too cold.  Think about their clothes If their bedroom or your home traps heat and itaposs over C indoors, a nappy and a thin vest is probably all you need. When they go out in the sun, make sure their skin is covered when possible, but that the fabric is breathable and light. Use a paddling poolYou should keep small children out of the sun where possible and set up a paddling pool for them to enjoy the fresh air and cool down.

Londoner Alexandra Milam, , travelled to Durdle Door in Dorset, where she was snapped wearing a iety of skimpy bikinis up against the  million-year-old rocks.But Alexandra and hundreds of other tourists who flocked to the beauty spot to enjoy the hot weather left graffiti on the beauty spot.Some also left piles of litter behind which filled  bags when cleared up by Lulworth Rangers and teams of volunteers. They also spent hours scrubbing the rocks to remove the unsightly markings left by reckless visitors. After spending hours removing the graffiti in C heat, Lulworth Rangers posted on social media: Graffiti removal tonight by the Lulworth Rangers. Andyou ever wanted to know what scrubbing off a hundred tags in  degree heat for over  hours looks like, well the last photo says it all . Alexandra has now apologised and pledged money to a charity fundraiser set up to clean the beach. She said: I feel awful because of this horric event in my le and I wish to express my deep regret for the damage by my name written on the Jurassic Coast.  I have learned a huge lesson, one which will forever mark me. I reached back to the community to meet all the people who sacriced their precious time to fix this disaster. I want to spread the awareness to everyone who doesnapost understand the beauty and importance of this place. I am disappointed that I didnapost understand it at the time and I donapost want anyone  making the same mistake.  Maybe nothing will undo the damage the writing caused but I will try to make things better and I hope people will give me the chance. James Weld, owner of the Lulworth Estate which owns Durdle Door, described scenes over the weekend as aposhorrendousapos. He said: We have a support team that are litter picking day and night and there are some fantastic volunteers as well. They donapost just clean up after people, they offer advice and hand out rubbish bags to people on the beach. We try and educate people but we canapost speak to every person.  Itaposs constant. On Sunday morning we took about  bags and there was about  from Friday. Itaposs horrendous. It is a natural environment and managing it is a complete nightmare. Itaposs extraordinary how some people are behaving. Alexandra, who is a fashion and make-up influencer, said she will donate £ monthly to the fundraiser which was set up by artist Erin Tyrrell, a volunteer beach cleaner. Erin said: Itaposs really heartwarming to see when someone has done wrong makes up for their actions.

The borough of Pendle in East Lancashire has one of the highest infection rates in the country. Council leaders fear a full Leicester-style lockdowna recent surge in cases is not controlled. And the people of Pendle, which includes the towns of Nelson, Colne and Barnoldswick, answered the call. The Mirror on Wednesday joined worried residents at two testing sites, one a drive-in and the other a walk-up. Outside the Pendle Rise shopping centre in Nelson, a team of nurses guided passers-by through the process. Tom Connell, , from nearby Burnley, said: “I heard about it on the radio this morning and as I was coming shopping I thought I would get tested. “It is the right thing to do and was no trouble at all. It took seconds. “If the area is in danger of another lockdown, we have to do our bit.” Glenys Higson, , from Barrowford, had also been tested at the drop-in centre. “I think it is a good thing they are doing. We don’t want another lockdown” she said. She had recently ed from Spain where she said she felt safer. “We are all on top of each other here. There is not as much space.”  Linda Richardson, , a social care worker from Nelson, got herself tested last week to protect the vulnerable people she looks after. The results came back within days and were thankfully negative. “I go into people’s houses and there is a natural concern about the virus” she said. “Getting tested is not so much about protecting yourself, it is about protecting others.”  Gulan Yazdani, , also from Nelson, fears another lockdown after spending months indoors earlier this year. “We don’t want that again” he said. But he is hesitant about getting tested unless he is suffering symptoms. “If I feel that I am unwell then I will go” he said.  Sarah Jolley, , from Southport, a dental nurse who has been redeployed to join the testing teams, swabbed the Mirror’s reporter at lunchtime. The painless procedure, which took a matter of seconds, involved her swtly placing a long cotton bud on both tonsils and then up each nostril. She said: “It is my first day here but it has been really positive. It has been a really good response. We have had about  people coming along to be tested.” Earlier we used the nearby drive-in facility in the town.  Motorists are handed the testing kit in their cars and have to swab themselves, running the cotton bud over their tonsils for ten seconds, before shoving it up their nose, sealing the stick inside a liquid vial and biohazard bag, and handing it back. The process was a far less pleasant experience but despite the discomfort a constant stream of people arrived to be tested. Last month Pendle was one of a number of areas which saw new restrictions imposed in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. They included a ban on visitors to homes and gardens and not meeting members of other households in pubs and restaurants.

Kusi Kimani, , from East Sussex, was shocked when she discovered a brown bra on the retaileraposs website was called tobacco. The lighter colours of the £ Marks  Spencer Collection padded bras are described as cinnamon and fudge. Ms Kimani complained about the bra for her skin tone carrying negative connotations, while more positive words were used for lighter colours. Yet two months on from her initial complaint, the bra is still being sold in a tobacco colour on the Marks  Spencer website. However, the retailer pledged to drop the name when approached by the Mirror and apologised for not acting sooner. Ms Kimani told : I saw it about two weeks after George Floydaposs death and it was particularly raw to see at that time. Why not call it cocoa, caramel or chocolate - sweet dessert items  But they used tobacco. I was shocked when I saw it. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror Itaposs hurtful to me and my friends. If a young girl who is already uncomfortable with the colour of her skinshe will be feeling even more alienated. Each week that website is showing that racism is another week a young girl may come across it and feel bad for the rest of her le. To see that apostobaccoapos is for their skin tone will make them feel unwanted by society. Tobacco is referred to in society as bad, unhealthy, and highly likely to kill - ‘smoking kills’.  This is an example of how bias is ingrained into society and only helps fuel racism, be it overt or covert, however in this instance this is a form of covert racism. The pharmaceutical clinical trials manager said she just wanted Marks  Spencer to change the name online - and to explain its reasons for the delay. The companyaposs customer service team previously told her that its colour names were not supposed to carry negative connotations.  In an email on June , the retailer said it was reviewing its naming convention and also looking at its product range with BAME staff. The message said: The names we use are taken from those on a colour palette and were never designed to match to a skin tone - I would like to assure you the choice of names is absolutely not intended to carry any negative connotations. We review design trends in the market each year to ensure we are offering a fashionable palette to all our customers, and we are actively reviewing our naming convention in the light of the feedback we are receiving.  We liaise with our store colleagues on a regular basis to determine which colours we need to offer our customer and we are also working with our BAME colleague network to receive their input too. The customer service representative said the company knows it had to have a better, wider skin colour offer, particularly for black and dark skin tones. They added that the range is currently under review so improvements can be made. Ms Kimani told : I approached Marks  Spencer as I thought it could have been an oversight. It shouldnapost be a matter of having to fight to be taken seriously. They are willing to stand with the Black Lives Matter movement but they are not willing to put in the work to make changes. In the past I would have been upset about it and buried it away. But this BLM movement has given me courage.

While the logistics will be dferent, the nerves and excitement will be exactly the same as Year s find outtheir hard work has earned them their dream university place. Itaposs something many of us went through, and whether you look back at that day with joy or sorrow, at least we didnapost have to do it with the whole world watching on - which is what members of the Royal Family do. This is the added pressure every royal teen has to deal with on results morning, and even though you would expect the best education that money can buy guarantees you decent grades, that isnapost always the case. Princes William and Harry, their wives Kate and Meghan, Charles and Princess Diana have a real iety of A-levels between them. But despite having an aptitude for learning, The Queen didnapost have time for formal schooling and instead spent her youth learning about the constitutional monarchy ropes. In contrast, her children and grandchildren have enjoyed a more normal education - and ying degrees of success to show for it. Hereaposs how they all got on... Prince William William started at the famous Eton College in  and stayed there for most of his education. He picked up his A-level results in  and his results were fairly mixed.  He got an A in geography, a B in art and a C in biology. These grades earned him a place to study History of Art degree at St Andrews University in Scotland, but he later swapped courses and changed to georgraphy. Before heading to uni William took a gap year, spending time in travelling to Chile, Kenya, Tanzania and Botswana.  He packed his bags and moved to St Andrews in , where he met his future we Kate Middleton. He left with a :. Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex wasnapost as academic as his big brother and left school with slightly worse grades. On the royalaposs website it simply says: His Royal Highness went on to Eton College from September  where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. He got a B in Art and D in Geography in his A Levels. However during his time at school Harry excelled in other areas, and was House Captain of Games.  He also represented the school at rugby, cricket and polo, and was a member of the Combined Cadet Force. After finishing in  Harry also took a gap year, travelling to Australia, Africa and Argentina. He decided against university and instead joined the Army, where he embarked on a successful career. The Duchess of Cambridge Kate beat William in their A-Levels, taking home better grades than him on results day. A good student from early on, Kate achieved  GCSEs at St. Andrew’s School in Pangbourne before moving to Marlborough College in Wiltshire.  Her hard work meant she got As in Maths and Art, and a B in English in her A-Levels. Like William, Kate took a gap year before starting anniversary and the pair actually did a very similar trip but their dates didnapost overlap. Kate graduated from St Andrews University in  with a : in History of Art. Meghan Markle As she was educated in America, Meghan didnapost follow the same exam system the rest of the Royals did. Meghan began her secondary education at Immaculate Heart High School in  where she was known as a hard working and focused student. During her high school years, The Duchess of Sussex performed in theatrical productions at both Immaculate Heart and Loyola High School. Her former drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, who directed Meghan in seven plays, remembered that her former student sparkled. She said: You see someone nice to the other kids, who gets good grades, doesnapost say anything bad about anybody. America does not test students using GCSEs or A Levels, and it has not been reported what Meghan got on her SATsbut it is known that she got the grades she needed to get into university. She went on gain a double major in Theatre and International Relations at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in . During her time at university, The Duchess completed an internship at the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she learned to speak Spanish. She also studied French for six years. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie Princess Eugenie is probably the smartest royalwhose two As in Art and English Literature and a B in History of Art, beat older sister Beatrice, who received an A in Drama and Bs in History and Film Studies. Beatrice, who got married earlier this year, went on to get a : from Goldsmithaposs in History of Ideas. Eugenie studied English Literature, History of Art and Politics at Newcastle and graduated at the end of her three-year course in  with a :, though there are reports her application was only considered because of her royal status. Prince Charles Prince Charles had a very dficult education to his sons, and was sent to the very strict Gordonstoun. He left with five O-levelsand two A-levels - a B in History and a C in French.  He then went on to Cambridge University where he achieved a : degree in History. Legend has it his bodyguard who was present at all lectures with the young prince sat the exams too - and got a First. Princess Diana Princess Diana didnapost do quite as well at school and failed all her O-levels, twice. However she apparently excelled in deportment, having attended finishing school in Switzerland. The Queen Sheaposs met politicians and film stars, speaks French fluently, loves to colour block and still rides a horse at  years of age, but the Queen has never sat an academic exam in her le meaning she hasnapost a single GCSE or A Levelto her name. In her early childhood, the Queen was taught by a governess from .am until am. Following the abdication of her uncle Edward VIII in , Elizabeth needed to prepare herself for her future role and received lessons on constitutional history from the vice provost of Eton, Henry Marten. The Queen’s father had disliked school and her mother thought it was more important to have fun,’ Professor Kate Williams, author of Young Elizabeth told Good Housekeeping. Unlike her father, the Queen was and is very bright and had an appetite for learning as well as a razor sharp memory. The lack of a formal education didnapost harm her as sheaposs naturally analytical and something of an autodidact, as well as being hard working - which we know now is just as important as raw brainpower. Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, attended Benenden school in Kent where she gained six O-levels, and three A-levels in English, History and Politics.

The two young officers had become the very best of pals after joining the Royal Norfolk Regiment together at the start of the Second World War. Their friendship deepened when they were shipped to the Far East and taken prisoner during the fall of Singapore. Starved and brutalised by their Japanese captors, they helped each other survive the horric Burma Railway. That evening, in August , as the men were being moved to a new jungle camp, Eric helped an exhausted Peter clamber into a truck. But, as he tried to join him, a guard yanked Eric back, ordering him to wait for the next transport. Eric protested and was floored by a rle butt, watching in dismay as the truck pulled away. It was the last time the -year-old second lieutenants ever saw each other. For when Eric eventually made it to the camp, he learned Peter had died from a heart attack and beriberi, a disease caused by vitamin B deficiency. He was one of , Allied soldiers and , Asian labourers who died while working on the Burma- Thailand railway, which included the infamous Bridge on the River Kwai.  Eric was given Peter’s identity “dog “T tags” by another prisoner and vowed to but one daythem to his parents. “Sadly, he never got round to doing was so,” says Eric’s son Robert Adie, . “Perhaps he found it hard to part with not them or he worried it would upset Peter’s parents at the time. “Then, as the years passed, people didn’t want reminding of the war, and he felt he’d missed the moment.”  Eric died in  aged . But, now, thanks to his son’s remarkable detective work, the dog tags have been ed to Peter’s family, in time for the th anniversary of VJ Day on Saturday. Lockdown gave Robert, from Bromley, South East London, time to track down Peter’s nephew, Robin Green. Now the mementos of a bond forged in war are sparking a new friend ship between the soldiers’ relatives. Robin, , from Norwich, was stunned when Robert rang him earlier this year. “Uncle Peter was my mother’s brother and I knew he’d died as a Japanese PoW,” he says.  “When I was  I wanted to buy a Japanese camera and was told ‘For God’s sake, don’t tell your grandparents’. And Peter had somehow managed to keep two small diaries while in captivity which were sent back after the war. They are hard to read in faded pencil but speaking with Robert has helped piece together events. The last entry was made on August , . It says ‘It was thought I had a heart attack. I did not know what happened.’ Peter died the following day.” But it is clear that he was still thinking about his friend until the very end. Because in the entry for August , Peter talks about the arrival of men from their old camp, adding sadly: “But not Eric yet.” Like many who served in the “Forgotten War” Eric only started to speak about his experiences later in le. Robert explains: “My father gave talks to school groups at the Imperial War Museum, where he told them of his time on the Death Railway. In the s he ed to Singapore with other Far Eastern prisoners-of-war and then I went back with him in . “We paid our respects at Peter’s grave at the Commonwealth military cemetery in Kanchanaburi.”  Robert learned how Eric joined the Royal Norfolk in November . After training, he and Peter were based at Marbury Hall near Liverpool, where the regiment was helping with fire-fighting duties in the heavily bombed city. They then spent three months on a troop ship to Singapore, arriving in January . Robert says: “But on February  Singapore fell to the Japanese and they were taken prisoner. “They spent the first six months under canvas looting Singapore for the Japanese, stripping anything of value. After that they were sent up country to construct the Burma Railway, clearing forests and creating cuttings with explosives. But then they got separated. “It must have been a terrible shock when Eric finally got to the new camp only to find his friend had died.” Eric was moved to Hintok Camp in Thailand and forced to work on the notorious Hellfire Pass, the railway cutting that claimed thousands of lives. It got its name because the sight of emaciated prisoners labouring at night by torchlight was “a vision of hell”.  Robert goes on: “At some point Eric caught malaria and beriberi, and developed jungle ulcers. “As he was unable to walk or work, he was sent back to Singapore and ended up in Changi Prison, until the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to the Japanese surrender. “Eric was shipped home via Ceylon arriving in Liverpool in October  after four years away. With him he brought a little Japanese netsuke figure, a bar of soap made from prison kitchen fat and Peter’s dog tags.” After the war Eric trained as a quantity surveyor and worked for the Ministry of Housing. He and we Orian had a daughter, Corinna, and then Robert. “But he always regretted not ing the tags to Peter’s family,” says Robert. “After his death I often thought of tracking them down too. Then lockdown gave me the time and opportunity, and realising Eric and Peter would have been  this year gave me the impetus. “Eric’s parents had been in touch with Peter’s while they were serving and I found an address in my grandparents’ old address book and started from there.

The home looks cosy on the inside, but the new owner will have trouble getting in, because there isnapost a front door. The unusual property in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, is thought to be one of only a few houses that has a big window where you would normally find a front door. To get inside the home, you will need to use the back door which is accessed through a paved courtyard. It raises a few questions, such as where would the post be delivered  But previous owners solved that issue, by installing a post box beneath one of the street-level windows, which drops post into a little wooden hatch in the living room. Among the other features in the quirky property, you’ll find a wood-burning stove in the front room, so you can stay nice and toasty as you watch the world go by from the two front windows.Upstairs youaposll find two bedrooms and a bathroom with a bath and shower.In other strange property news, people were left scratching their heads after a video of a aposskinny houseapos went viral on TikTok.

Met Office warnings of thunderstorms and heavy rain were in place for large swathes of the UK on Wednesday. A yellow thunderstorm warning was issued by the Met Office covering much of England, Wales and parts of Scotland. An amber warning also covered a smaller area. In west London, Twickenham residents were pelted with large hailstones which cascaded down during a brief break from wall-to-wall sunshine. Footage on social media showed how roads were flooded by the unexpected deluge which sent residents running for cover. Extreme temperatures that have baked the UK this week have been responsible for numerous unusual weather events across the country. In Horsham, West Sussex days of scorching temperatures saw a dried out field burst into flames, while sun worshippers in Clevedon, Somerset headed to the townaposs marine lake to cool off. People in Aberdeen, Scotland were doing less sunbathing than they were wading after morning thunderstorms caused flash flooding. Nick Delves, assistant head gardener at the National Trustaposs Nymans Gardens in West Sussex, spent yesterday hoping forecasts for rain came true so his plants wouldnapost wilt. Social media users were left stunned as skies above the UK turned orange in a spectacular sunset.  And on Monday, huge hailstones the size of golf balls have pelted parts of north Wales. The huge chunks of ice came falling from the sky with such force in Capel Curig that they set off car alarms. An incredible video, recorded by Jenny Davies from Snowdonia shows the crazy scenes with some residents fearing that car windscreens would shatter due to the extreme conditions. She said: We were having a very hot and humid day, sun cream was needed this morning!  But storms had been forecast. At around pm the sky went darker until it was like night time. We had lightning and heard thunder. Probably around .pm it went even darker and the hail started - I was inside and it sounded like gunshots banging on the windows! Iaposve never seen hail like that. It was huge. We were worried it would break the car windshields.

The figures, taken from the American Academy of Pediatrics from July  to , come as the country tops five million cases - , of which are children - and over , deaths. As some schools re-open for face-to-face classes this month, Dr Tina Hartert, of Vanderbilt University, said increased testing of kids is key to understanding their role in transmitting the killer bug. The doctor is leading a government-funded study which has seen , families receive DIY testing kits. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE    The kits are shipped to the families, they are taught how to collect these samples, and then the samples are sent back by the families to a central repository, she told CBS News. It was initially believed children were less susceptible to the virus - however, at least  kids have died in the US in July from Covid-. Itaposs left teachers and school bosses desperately looking for solutions on how to follow restrictions while educating pupils.Some universities are also grappling with safely reopening campuses, with new restrictions including banning parties, road trips and outside visitors. A photo at North Paulding High School, Georgia, where schools have already re-opened, went viral last week showing pupils not wearing masks. It comes after Facebook deleted a post by US president Donald Trump  for the first time after he shared a clip in which he claimed children are almost immune. The social media  deemed this a violation of its rules against sharing misinformation about the  coronavirus. The clip came from an interview with Fox  Friends earlier that day. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhas said that while adults make up most of the known Covid- cases to date, some children and infants have been sick with the disease and they can also transmit it to others. During a briefing at the White House on the same day, Trump repeated his claim that the virus had little impact on children. Children handle it very well, he told reporters. If you look at the numbers, in terms of mortality, fatalities ... for children under a certain age ... their immune systems are very very strong and very powerful.

The situation will be reviewed again in a week’s time.Ms Sturgeon said: “Cases are still far higher than in any other part of the country and considerably higher than they were in Grampian before the outbreak started. So based on an assessment from the incident management team and advice from the chief medical officer, the Scottish Government’s conclusion is that it is not yet possible to lt any of the restrictions that were put in place last week for Aberdeen.”She added: “We continue to watch closely for any signs that the outbreak has spread to Aberdeenshire in any signicant way, but at present we are not placing any additional restrictions on people living in the #Shire.”Ms Sturgeon said police had reported a high level of compliance with the additional restrictions imposed last week and thanked the public for taking heed of them.Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland had been involved in the decision to continue the local lockdown measures.She added:  “I want to stress that nobody wants these restrictions to be in place for longer than is necessary. They will be reviewed in one week’s time and as soon as we can relax any of them, then we will do.”The restrictions in Aberdeen mean:Ms Sturgeon defended the Test and Protect system when Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie asked why it had been “unable to contain” the virus in Aberdeen.Mr Rennie said the city had gone from “isolated incidents to a full regional lockdown” in a “matter of hours”.Ms Sturgeon claimed the system had worked “very effectively”, saying that the situation in the city would have been far worse without it.The first minister said Test and Protect had identied Aberdeen’s pubs as the source of the outbreak, but stressed that the first line of defence against the virus was people taking action to protect themselves against it.“Test and Protect has worked very effectively in Aberdeen,” she said. “Without test and protect, we would not be dealing with – albeit a large and complex outbreak – but one that I hope is on its way to being contained. We would already be dealing with widespread community transmission.”In response to Aberdeen South and North Kincardine MSP Maureen Watt, Ms Sturgeon said she would press the Treasury to extend the Eat Out to Help Out scheme in the city to help hospitality businesses when the restrictions are relaxed.But the first minister added that it was not yet “safe of sensible” to reopen cafes which do not have an alcohol licence, but added that the situation would be kept under review.The first minister also pledged to look at guidance on childcare arrangements for those Aberdonians who rely on grandparents based in Aberdeenshire, after the issue was raised by Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It was a wee bit early for him this evening but he is improving all the time.“We hope he comes back into things for the weekend.”There was also encouraging news regarding Jamie Robson, who was involved in a terrible head clash with Hibs player Paul McGinn.Mellon added: “He took a nasty head knock in what was a really honest challenge.“Common sense has to prevail there. Why would he want to knock himself out going for header “He came off the worst but he is all right and we have good medical people here.“We will make sure he is well looked after.”Central defender Ryan Edwards, who made his debut, came off with what looked like a hamstring injury but Mellon was upbeat, saying: “He is all right. That’s the problem when you bring in players who are a bit behind in their match fitness.”Dundee United fans# group warns jobs could be lost nationwideScottish football shuts down\" title\"#Dundee United fans# group warns jobs could be lost nationwideScottish football shuts down# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp fears-for-livelihoods--scottish-football-shutdown-after-coronavirus-rule-breaches embed # secretfSEMzreV\" data-secret\"fSEMzreV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking. Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise.

The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding.

I#d thought with it being near a pre-historic site they might say no, but he thought it sounded great. I was a bit taken aback. The forestry people were also up for it and all of a sudden it was all go,# said Gabi.Weather depending, it should take  days from start to finish. The first job is to clear brambles and other trip hazards before the lime washing can be applied.Dr Aaron Watson from Kilmartin Museum will be documenting the project.Gabi continued: #When I was researching what to white the stumps with I knew I wanted to use something traditional to Scotland that would not contaminate the place. Limewash is used to paint houses here. Then I discovered it creates crystals. Rockart was made using quartz # they would peck at rocks with it to make their marks. I liked the link. It was a good coincidence.#The shape will change depending on where it is seen from. As visitors walk towards it, it will be like an oval but once at the rockart site it will look like a circle.To follow Ormaig Landart Project follow these links:  Instagram: @gstuckemeier"},{"url":null,"title":"rest and be thankful diversion route to close for second night","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFor the second night running the old military road ersion route at the Rest and be Thankful will close.Met Office weather warnings for thunderstorms mean that the route, which runs below the landslide-hit A trunk road, will close overnight again from pm on Tuesday August  as a safety precaution.The local ersion route closed during the hours of darkness on Monday night due to forecast heavy rain, re-opening around am on Tuesday.All traffic will be erted from pm on to the standard ersion route via the A, A, A and A.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

in the Far East endured a ldquobrutal war, but received little ldquolimelight.Speaking to the PA news agency ahead of the anniversary on Saturday, General Lord Dannatt highlighted the work of the multi-national th Army fighting the Japanese, particularly during the Burma campaign.ldquoThe geographic circumstances were very, very harsh in the jungle, fighting against an enemy, the Japanese,

probably didnrsquot know that much about it, you didnrsquot feel that close to it.Historian and author Neil Storey, who is compiling stories of the war for the Royal British Legion Industriescharity, explained that the first notion of a forgotten army applied to the British, Indian and Australia forces defeated at Singapore in .Some , Allied troops were taken prisoner of war, unable to communicate with their families back home, joining thousands of other forced civilian labourers from across the Far East working on the infamous Burma railway, on farms and down mines.ldquoIn a lot of ways, they are the first forgotten army and they were not released until August .

We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be

morning cycle.As I came out from Musselburgh Lagoons towards the mouth of the Esk, I saw the magnicent sight of all the seabirds, the swans and the geese gathered at that point where river meets sea.It occurred to me then that my best holiday this year could be to live in my own place as though I were a tourist.In my own hometown, I can still be awed by unexpected beauty, delighted by the

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.Sleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"new-head-education-named","story":"Ms Brown is currently the chief operating officer for education with the local authority and will take the place of Fiona

Authorityreviewed the submissions and using a lsquostatistical modelrsquo, which took into account the historic exam performances of schools, downgraded thousands of submitted grades, causing a national outrage.In East Lothian, , pupils received some grades which had been marked down.Only  of the , young people who were due to sit SQA exams had any of their final grades increased.The results dropped through letterboxes last Tuesday and sparked a furious backlash from students who received lower grades than expected.Erin Campbell, , Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor Musselburgh, said many friends had been left worried and scared after the initial results came out, warning that the fiasco had been ldquobad for their mental health.Erin, who was a sixth-year student at Musselburgh Grammar School, said: ldquoOn a personal level, I was lucky to receive the results that I needed in order to move on to university however, I am aware of a lot of young people, including close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish Government to step in and overturn the results.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray, Labourrsquos education spokesperson, called on Mr Swinney to resign after he initially backed the modied results before bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would

 adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who

Theyre the one point of contact between the vehicle and the road, meaning any issue with them could prove disastrous. Its why its so important to check them. Look at the sidewalls for any cuts or damage which could lead to a puncture, and scope out the general condition of the rubber. If its cracked and dry, it might be time for a change.And, of course, look at the tread depth. The legal limit in the UK and Ireland is .mm, and one of the easiest ways to tellyour tyres are within this is with a p coin. Simply insert the coin into the tread groovesthe outer band of the coin is obscured by tyre, then youre within the limit. If you can see the band, the tyres need replacing.Wed check the tyre pressures too. Most garages have air compressors to top up air . Check the required pressure for your tyres by consulting your cars handbook or on the instruction  inside the fuel filler cap. Adjust your pressures accordingly and not only will your tyres perform more effectively, but itll save you money in fuel, too.OilOil is crucial to the smooth running and operation of your cars engine. Without it, youre in for a whole heap of trouble. Its why ensuring your cars oil levels are correct is so important, as without a proper amount, theres the potential for a lot of damage to take place. Yet despite being so crucial, its simple to check. Simply wait for the engine to coolits been running, and find the dipstick within the engine bay. Its often highlighted with a yellow handle, butyoure struggling to find it, consult the cars handbook.Then, once found, pull out the dipstick and clean it with a rag or paper towel. Re-insert it into the engine and take it out once more now, youll be able to see the level of oil in the engine via the dipsticks markers.If its too low, add more oil. Only do a bit at a time, and repeat the dipstick process each time - you dont want to overfill it.Windscreen washer fluidParticularly during the summer months when theres more dust and insects on the road, making sure youve got enough windscreen washer fluid is important. Much like oil, its dangerous to run out of, but easy to check. Again, look under the bonnet, this time for a blue cap. If the levels are low, simply top up with the correct washer fluid. Avoid using just water.CoolantCoolant is integral to keeping your cars engine at the correct temperature. During summer this is very important, but its just as key during colder months too. Though its unlikely that your coolant levels will have dropped, its always worthwhile checking the tank - again, this is typically found under the bonnet. Only ever use the manufacturers recommended coolant to top up the systemits low.FuelIt might sound simple, but ensuring that youve got plenty of fuel in the tank in readiness for a long journey can easily slip peoples minds. In fact, plenty of drivers undertake a trip and forget to fill up, resulting in a fair amount of stress during travel.Before you set off, check your fuel gauge and ensure youve got enough to get you to your destination. If not, its worth filling up closer to home, where you know the location of filling stations. Leaving it until later could result in the stressful situation of having to find a fuel station in an unfamiliar area.LightsLights can be an aspect of a car which are easily forgotten during the lighter months when the days are longer and the nights shorter. However,youre making a longer trip, theres a good chance that youll be driving in darkness as you near your destination, which makes fully working lights crucial.Check that your headlights and indicators are working up front, and test the rear lights and brake lights too. Wed give the hazards a test for good measure too - you never know when you might need them."},{"url":null,"title":"create-seaside-themed-garden","story":"Award-winning garden designer Joe Perkins, who lives close to the sea in Brighton, and Lynette Talbot, chairperson of Sidmouth In Bloom, offer their tips on how you can recreate beach vibes in your outdoor space...Set the scene with sandy soil or gravel\"Ideally, youd need sandy soil or a gravel footpath. Gravel gardens can make it look like a beach,\" says Cha Gold medallist Perkins, whose  Facebook show garden Growing The Future will be displayed at next years show.\"You could do worse than put down four or five inches of gravel, and many seaside plants would be happy growing in it. If you have poor drainage or heavy soil, build up a gravel layer, adding sand or soil to add nutrients.:Letters: When it comes to language, lets live and let live\"A lot of coastal plants will be perfectly happy growing into that layer and many of them dont need much soil, andthey do, like sea kale, they will have a deep tap root which theyll send down to stabilise themselves.\"\"Treat your seaside garden like an alpine garden,\" says Talbot. \"You want free-draining soil, which you can build up like a rockery or clf face, incorporating shorter grasses like carex or small miscanthus, to give you the feel of the wispy grasses along the edge of the shoreline.\"Pick suitable plants\"If you like the spartan look, you could make a gravel garden planted with rivers of thyme, dwarf myrtle bushes and some evening primrose coming through it.\"Stock up on free-draining species\"Other good plants to create a sea feel would include santolinas, lavenders, silver-leaf plants and some sea poppies, which need to be planted in a very free-draining, gritty soil, with a good sand and compost mix because they dont like being in a very fertile garden. Known as the horned poppy, these perennials have lemon flowers and large, bean-like seed heads,\" continues Talbot.:Herald Diary: Getting to grips with a Titanic struggle\"Thrtis another good choice and comes in colours from white to darkish red. You can buy any of the Ballerina Series in the alpine section of a local nursery.\" She also recommends sea holly , sedums, artemisia and mallows.For border colour, you could go with acanthus, euphorbias, Phlomis russelianaand valerian , erigeronand low-growing herbs such as thyme, lavender and rosemary, Perkins suggests.Add seaside accessories\"Create a small area with some shingle and put some posts on the side, with a rope link between them or some firemens buckets or tyres or rings which could be painted red to resemble lebuoys, or get some glass fishermens jars. You might be able to get hold of some crayfish or lobster baskets, which give an area a nice seaside feel,\" Talbot advises.\"Thick ropes, which you often see tying a boat to a mooring, are a great accessory. You can get a garden-sized boat and plant that up, putting it on a small shingle bed, with alpine grit over the top to finish.\"Display beach finds carefullyPerkins says you have to be careful when putting shells or drtwood youve found on beach-combing walks on display at random points in the garden. \"Instead of dotting things around, make a display cabinet of perhaps a series of shells, which makes sense of them being there.\"Create a beach-inspired social spot\"For me, being on the beach is about getting together in the evening and relaxed social gatherings, so I would think about fire pits, deck chairs and that sort of low-slung seating you can really relax into. Fire pits are great, whether you choose gas or wood fire,\" Perkins observes.Hammocks and outdoor bean bags could also be added to create that beach feel, he suggests."},{"url":null,"title":"mary-contini-recipe-spaghetti-scottish-chanterelle-funghi","story":"Chanterelle are prolic in our woods at this time of year.

Independenceis a prerequisite for so many desirable changes.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.MARK Smith concludes that by concentrating on combating the pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon has a strategy that has made both independence and her party more popular. This is a two-fold issue. The first is that polling had independence rising in popularity before the pandemic struck. The second might bolster Mr Smiths case, but as a mirror image.It is British nationalists who have continued to push the constitution as their main concern in Scotland, with a parade of little-known politicians now wandering round our country, eulogising the virtues of a Union, even while forcefully removing Scotland out of another union that had all the positives they extol. That might go some way to explaining their unpopularity in this country. We will have an election in , where British nationalism will be represented by two politicians, one who will be a peer by then and one still an MP, both of whom refuse to consider that Scots should have a say in their own future. Their policy will be apparently guided by an Australian who is being invited into interfering in the Scottish democratic process.

This shameful record may explain why the Scottish urban working class, as Mr Maciver describes it, has deserted Labour.Reading Mr Macivers article closely gives a further clue to his thinking, politics as a career, not politics based on deeply held principles, this all too often has been a trait of \"social democratic\" politicians.Brian Harvey, Hamilton."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-comes-language-live-let-live","story":"I suspect there are myriad instances of misuse of language in all its multiple genres or categories.

Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled. But, strangely, there has not been anything like the controversy over moderation that we have seen here.The inconvenient truth is that the Scottish ldquopandemic cohort, as they are already being dubbed, has exchanged one unfairness for another. They may have got the grades they and their teachers wanted, but those grades will forever be tainted by the chaotic and unprincipled way in which they were awarded.

We are in a war. Not a war against another nation, or a terrorist entity, but a war against a virus. And just as when we emerged from great wars, we took the opportunity to do things dferently, we must do the same now.The impact of coronavirus has been so severe, the consequences so profound, that we have an obligation on behalf of our people to exploit any silver lining we can possibly find in the enormous cloud which hovers above us.This can be a time of total national renewal. A time to hit the reset button across public le.I am no longer a party political player, and I have written in these pages on many occasions that I have found the SNP in government to be reliable and competent.Since its election in , a relatively small group of talented people have managed the country perfectly well, however the key word in this sentence is \"managed\". This has not been a radical government, and given the inevitability of its continuation until at least , we are all invested in that changing.In Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney, the country has two people who, due to the formerrsquos historic popularity, are almost uniquely placed to take the country with them whatever they decide to do. Leaving aside the independence issue, to leave a legacy worth remembering, it is time to throw caution to the wind.The obvious first, and probably most important example, is uppermost in our thoughts this week: education. Our focus currently is on an acute issue in the form of the exam results, just as a few months ago it was on the acute question of when children wouldto school. But those are snapshots, stories, symptoms.:Jobs guarantee for young Scots backed by poundm fundingThe real issue here is not the acute but the chronic we have a state school system which is inadequately preparing our children for the world which greets them when they leave. I have now acquired direct experience of this, with four children in the state school system.It is not hyperbolic to say that I have encountered almost nothing which has genuinely impressed me. We are living a lie in this country, blindly accepting old tropes about Scotland having a world-leading education system. We do not. It is unambitious, with very little encouragement of the pursuit of excellence. It is secretive, with decisions iniably favouring councils and unions at the expense of pupils and parents, who are often treated as an inconvenience. And it is iniquitous, with thosewho have been able to pay for a house in a good catchment area effectively purchasing a chance for our children to emerge unscathed.Education leads to economic success. Education leads to high tax receipts. Education leads to good health and wellbeing. Education reduces welfare dependency. Education is everything. But we are sleepwalking into a national catastrophe because we are too afraid to admit that we are struggling.Today, the education secretary John Swinney faces a confidence vote a trap laid by opposition smelling political blood. Fine Irsquom certain the SNP would do the samethe shoe was on the other foot. But Irsquom not interested in that. As a citizen I recognise that the SNP will be in power for the next term of government and I believe that Mr Swinney has the skill, knowledge and respect to lead a rethink of everything. Starting age. Term times. Class sizes. Curriculum. Everything. We are all invested in his success.This is true not only of education. When the story of Covid  is told, Irsquod put the mortgage on the NHS emerging from that story as the hero. The NHS, as has often been said, is this countryrsquos national religion, and the hysteria which accompanies any sceptical comment about its quality ensures that the only political intervention it attracts is no-strings-attached increases in funding.:Letters: This is the final nail in the coffin of our education systemThat is no longer acceptable. As we try to analyse, in Scotland and the UK, whether we have coped well with Covid  relative to our peers, to leave the NHS out of that discussion would be an act of national self-harm.There are facts here, and they sit stubbornly in the way of the narrative. Our NHS has  percent fewer doctors per head than the OECD average. We have barely half the average number of hospital beds per head. We have less than half the number of MRI scanners, and one-third the number of CT scanners per head.We scrape into the OECD top- for survival rates for major cancers ndash colorectal, breast and cervical. We perform even worse ndash outside the top  ndash in mortality rates for heart attack, haemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. And all of this is despite comparable financing of the system. Readers, we are not the envy of the world.This is not OK. We should stop thinking this is OK. We should stop saying this is OK. It demeans us to do so. You can support taxpayer-funded healthcare, as I do, and support the people who work in it, as I do , whilst also advocating a renewal of the delivery mechanism.However the critical first hurdle in a national renewal ndash the part we in Scotland have always found ourselves unable to leap ndash is to admit that we have problems. That we too often bask in our own mediocrity. So herersquos one idea. The Scottish Government should create a small National Renewal Unit. Give them a big travel budget.

The credibility of a nationrsquos education system is based mainly on its examination processes and is the point at which international comparisons are often made. Those looking in from abroad must draw the conclusion that the robustness of the Scottish system has vanished and, in its place, are standards that should be openly questioned. Last week pupils who had worked hard were disadvantaged by the system put in place, today that situation has not changed as many pupils have been given awards that ultimately would not have been justied in normal circumstances due to gross inflation negligence by school staff. Despite assurances to the contrary from the SNP, the results for  cannot, by any sensible logic, be seen as comparable to years gone by. We now have a situation where a year of \"record\" results will be followed next year by unparalleled decline.Very little mention has been made of those schools and teachers who hugely inflated their pupilsrsquo performance, which in no small part is at the heart of the issue. This deception and lack of professionalism is truly breath-taking and highlights how the once-strong Scottish system has been hijacked by a combination of suspect moderation procedures and bully tactics by the EIS. This needs to be front and centre of any review, though how independent this will be is anyonersquos guess.As someone from a \"deprived\" area, I knew the value of education and the need to work hard to get on in le. As a result, I have been involved in education for more than  years, most of these in the classroom and I visit schools on a regular basis. I am sure there will be the usual protestations from teachers and the unions to this sort of letter, but those like myself who remember what our system once was and could be again look on utterly appalled. If the Cabinet Secretary had any honour, he would resign immediately, but as a career politician, I am sure his only thoughts are how to dig the SNP out of yet another hole.John Campbell, Glasgow.NATURAL justice required that the Government reverse the iniquitous \"moderation\" process applied this year, by the SQA, to teacher-based student assessments. The decision should be welcomed. But this is merely a first step to what needs to be the most fundamental reform.A claim that this decision will destroy the \"credibility\" of end of schooling certication in Scotland, because it is unfair to those who earned their grades in previous years, is woefully misinformed. There is an important historic injustice to be addressed but it is not that those who earned so-called \"good\" grades in the past have had these devalued by the awards in . It is that the SQA system that so grossly underestimated the achievements and performance of learners this year, has been doing the same thing to students, mainly from disadvantaged backgrounds, for at least  years.Evidence of predictive validity ndash the extent to which end of schooling grades correlate with subsequent performance in either higher education or employment ndash is conspicuous by its absence. If employers and universities base their admissions processes on grades earned through external examinations alone, they are truly \"buying a pig in poke\".The reductionist myth that it is possible to devise a \"national\" examination system that can accurately and fairly assess, at the end of formal schooling, the multarious skills and abilities of young people and convert these into meaningful numerical scales is plainly erroneous. The counter argument is that national assessments merely serve as an elaborate ndash but grossly unfair ndash social sorting process. This means that those with sufficient funds to live in \"leafy suburbs\", employ private tutors or patronise independent schools, can ensure the progress of their offspring to the most prestigious universities and careers.What would be a genuine insult to credibility would be a , after this year, to the previous system. It is welcome that there is to be an immediate inquiry. What this process needs to do is open to public scrutiny the assumptions and processes that have led us to this sorry state. What we do not need is another, glacially-slow-moving bureaucratic grand committee, led by the \"great and good\" and stuffed with nominees from education quangos ndash such as HM Inspectorate, Education Scotland and the SQA. The unimaginative institutional groupthink of these bodies is a major cause of the problems we face ndash they are most unlikely to spawn a solution.We should congratulate all those learners who earned their awards in this dficult year. We must also acknowledge a debt to the young people who took to the streets to protest at the injustice done to them. In this they have alerted a much wider community to the source of serious inequalities in Scottish society. It would be to betray these young people,those who can do not now ensure that this system is changed.Jim Rand, Blanefield.THE hagiographical accounts by contributors on todayrsquos Letters Pagesof the Damascene conversion of humble saint John Swinney on the road to next Mayrsquos elections, paled into insignicance against the more accurate and sober judgement of your columnist, Iain Macwhirter, who rightly identied Swinneyrsquos performance, not that of the SQA, as the fiasco .The decision by Mr Swinney, with the encouragement of his party leader, to complete a volte face over the exam results, is naked populism, based on a fear that droves of - year olds and their families might desert the SNP at the ballot box next May. It smacks of total panic and complete capitulation.An independent body of markers will, in my opinion, always be best placed to grade exam results. This is because, unlike teachers marking their own pupils, independent markers have no emotional ties with the pupils they are grading, and therefore can mark dispassionately and objectively no vested interest in the school doing well, and possibly rising up educational league tables, and use a standardised system across the whole of Scotland, not one applied dferently in each school, by each teacher, most of whom, no doubt, will have had little experience of objectively grading course work.In times of crisis, one expects onersquos political leaders to maintain a cool head in the penalty box. Instead of that, the SNP has gone into a blind panic and, at a stroke, has degraded this yearrsquos exam results and potentially put the future of the SQA in doubt.A definite \"E\" grade performance from Mr Swinney and Ms Sturgeon, Must try harder, I think is the phrase that best applies here.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.HOLYROOD has descended through farce into some form of infantile Punch and Judy Show where the aim is to score points and humiliate opponents rather than to further the interests of the general public. John Swinney was handed the poisoned chalice of exam results and was going to get a kicking irrespective of what he did. Imagine the furorethe original announcement showed pass-rates had soared to the now readjusted level there would have been demands that the outrageous results were downgraded as being unrealistic and that Mr Swinney should go.Why isnrsquot the finger of accusation being pointed at the SQA for having an assessment system where the exam results are so out of alignment with the estimations of teachers in both the private and public sectors who actually know the students  One-off exams are an imperfect form of assessing ability, we all know knew ldquosmart people who were good at passing exams but who couldnrsquot put a nut in the proverbial monkeyrsquos mouth what I canrsquot understand is how so many of them end up as politicians and civil servants.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.THIS week I wrote about the inequity facing poor students whose success was capped by statistics not merit . We have now seen the Education Secretary apologise and share how long he knew about issues. Signicant issues have been facing education for some time now around assessment, inequity, culture and governance. The announced retrospective review of the most recent crisis may collate issues. These were rightly raised by academics calling out issues. Some issues sadly remain now for eternity ndash teachers judgment was questioned and some students got uplted grades because the system rewarded rich, high-attaining schools.However, where are the forward-looking improvements  Education reform in Scotland has been spasmodic and unsatisfactory. One academic suggested only a third of reforms were successful. Furthermore there is still no date for the OECD review. Why canrsquot this happen remotely  Indeed, Scottish education missed a wider opportunity during this crisis. Shts to school online learning and other much-needed reform have not taken place. Change theories note the positive impact urgency can bring. It seems improvements for our young people are not changing fast.Neil McLennan, Senior Lecturer and Director of Leadership Programmes, University of Aberdeen.IF John Swinney considered it was correct to do another spectacular U- turn by ignoring the SQA downgrades and restoring the better grades proposed by the teachers, what is his justication for simultaneously accepting the upgrades proposed by the same SQA and ignoring the worse grades proposed by those same teachers  Clinical political hypocrisy on display Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.WHY is it when ordinary people change their minds itrsquos described as such and when politicians do the same in response to appeals itrsquos a \"humiliating climbdown  Small wonder that few want to enter politics when such a level of perfection is expected.Dave Stewart, Glasgow G.Read more: Letters: The credibility of Scottish education is now at risk"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : amAt least nine people in the Orkney community have been caught up in an emerging situation relating to a rising number of coronavirus cases in the county.

Pamela Walker, NHSO ambulatory care manager has explained that services are gradually being remobilised, with the situation ing to normal, but there are limitations on the number of patients who could be operated on every day due to the additional COVID- restrictions. “We can now do four general anaesthetics every day ,# she said. #However, patients needing local anaesthetics are being fitted in around the general anaesthetics and this is reducing the number of those still waiting for a procedure increasing the number of procedures being safely undertaken.”The theatre Day Unit teams are also limited to doing surgeries linked to one discipline a day as space in the Day Unit is reduced from ten to six trolleys. This is because some of the space normally used for theatre Day Unit has been given over to the COVID ventilation unit which, is to remain in place for the foreseeable future.“But we are working through the lists and we are confident that all those waiting will be attended to,” Ms Walker added. “While some people might feel we have forgotten about them, this is not the case.

These estimates, based on their work during the school year, were then submitted to a Scottish Qualications Authoritymoderation system which downgraded the results — on criteria including the historic performance of the school.This sparked a huge backlash from students and politicians.Orkney Islands Council’s executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said he was “delighted” by Tuesday’s announcement, made by an under-fire education secretary John Swinney.He said: “The signicant and detailed work carried out by teaching staff and school managers was to an incredibly high standard, and I had every confidence in the approach and final outcome presented to the SQA.”The u-turn now means that teacher estimates will be reinstated, and there will be no need for any appeals process.In Orkney, the downgrading of awards totalled .The total number of exam entries at Kirkwall Grammar School was , across National s, Highers and Advance Highers. Out of those,  were downgraded by the SQA.At Stromness Academy, there was a total of  entries, and a reduction of  across National s, Highers and Advanced Highers. In total, around  estimates were raised by the SQA at both schools.With the small numbers at Junior High Schools, there were very few changes made by the SQA up or down on teacher estimates.Mr Swinney, who is now fighting to save his political career, has already conceded that they got it wrong, and said an independent review would take place to look at where lessons can be learned.The SQA will now reissue grades, based solely on teacher judgement. UCAS and other admission bodies will be informed of the new grades as soon as practical to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.The headteachers of Stromness Academy and Kirkwall Grammar School, Jane Partridge and Don Hawkins both said they had full confidence in their teachers’ judgements to produce “well-considered” estimates.Mr Hawkins added: “The staff have gone above and beyond to ensure a considered and moderated set of results.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The council is also looking at ways to fill gaps in childcare provision for children under two and after school care for older children.The move is in tandem with schools and marks a signicant milestone in the Government’s “route map” out of lockdown as Scotland continues to make good progress in suppressing COVID-.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said the focus is very much “getting it right for every child” in ing to these services after a challenging period of many months.“The decision to close Early Learning and Childcaresettings has had an impact on the lives of children and families throughout Orkney,# Mr Wylie explained.#There was little time to prepare, or scope to explain, the changes to our youngest children. Their relationships and friendships were abruptly interrupted as well as their learning.“Our focus must be on supporting children when they are in settings, to form a secure and emotionally resilient attachment base which will stand them in good stead as they grow and develop.  Nurturing and attached relationships are essential to creating the conditions for children to flourish in early learning and childcare.“All children have a right to play, to learn and to access experiences that meet their physical, social, emotional and cultural needs, and they have a right to associate with their peers. The health and wellbeing of children and adults is vital and these important rights and considerations have all been factored into the development of a framework for reopening and delivering ELC services.“We now know that young children are less likely to be affected by or transmit the virus. This means we are able to reduce some of the restrictions on ELC delivery laid out in previous guidance. However, we cannot yetto normal ELC practice – we all need to ensure that we continue to manage services and mitigate risks.”Mr Wylie pointed out that every child will have dferent levels of required support. He explained that some children have additional support needs and it will be important as part of the risk assessments carried out to consider the inidual needs of a child. Where there is a need to work in close proximity with adults and children the appropriate safety measures should be put in place based on that risk assessment.There will be a short transitional period for introducing our youngest children back into their learning and childcare services this week and this will y within each setting. The aim is to have all children, where possible, back into their settings by August .In line with government advice, there will be no requirement for physical distancing between children in nurseries. In nurseries two metre distancing will not apply between adults and children as, this does not meet young children’s social and emotional needs. However, adults will need to stay two metres apart wherever possible.Similarly, no PPE is required when undertaking routine educational activities. However, staff will continue to follow existing guidance on PPEit is required.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

After the devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, , British and Commonwealth troops were posted to Japan to help support the US occupation and reconstruction effort.Among them was Tom Clarke from Ballymena and his daughter Sandra gave theaccess to her collection of photographs of her father and spoke about his memories to mark this sombre anniversary.Sandra, who lives in the village of Lundin Links on the coast of Fe, still keeps in contact with her old friends locally via social media.“Dad was born to Joseph and Jeannie Clarke nee woodcock at Clonavon Place. “He must have been a character in his earky years because he ran away to Belfast at  to try and join the RAF, but he said they gave him a good kick in the backside and and sent him home,” laughs Sandra.SELECTIONEventually Tom met the selection criteria and joined the RAF, subsequently being posted as groundcrew to the Far East where he served in Burma, India and Japan. “My dad was fiercely, proud of his time in RAF. He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had. So he always used to phone me saying I’ve got you another medal - he actually got another  medals,which were commemorative only.”Sandra looked set to follow in her father’s footsteps but her initial attempt ended in failure!“ I asked at  for my dad to sign my papers to join WRAF, but he refused, only for me to join QARANC  years later.” Sandra’s memories of her father also revolve around musicianship.“I asked him one day what would you like to be remembered for and he said his love of music. “He played the trumpet all his le and was in the Silver Band with his brothers Joe and James and their cousins the Woodcocks.“He had a little dance band in the early s ,I remember them playing in the green hut down Harryville Park.”Footnote: Japan surrendered to the Allies on August , six days after the Soviet Unions declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September  in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II.

AnnaSophia Gallaghergrew up in Glenavy but has lived in the Lebanese capital for the last two years.Last Tuesday, she was sitting outside a restaurant with a friend around a mile away from the port where the huge blast took place.She said the heroic efforts of volunteers since then stand in stark contrast to shocking neglect by the authorities, with an angry backlash forcing the government to resign on Monday.It#s believed that over  people died in the explosion - caused by , tonnes of ammonium nitrate being stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years - with thousands more injured and displaced from their homes while the threat of coronavirus remains.Speaking to the Belfastshortly before a minute#s silence was held across Lebanon, AnnaSophia recalled the terrying moment of absolute, total destruction.I was sitting outside a restaurant with a friend who had just arrived.

The international attention is very important to maintain the pressure to reform - whether or not those reforms will come and when and how is the bigger question.She said the arrival of foreign aid and finding her neighbour#s traumatised dog hiding under a bed in a dferent building had been among many emotional moments in the last week.One of the most poignant things was the night of the blast when I was sitting down having a short break.There was a man standing beside me and I asked himhe needed anything. He said, #I#m Syrian, we#re used to this# and my heart just broke like that. What world do we live in where someone is used to that  She added: Everyone is really taking care of each other and the solidarity among the people here is truly remarkable in the absence of any government solidarity with them.AnnaSophia works for a Northern Irish Lebanese company, Siren Associates, which works to make public institutions more accountable. Now working from home, she said the most pressing need is access to accommodation, healthcare and clean water.Meanwhile, work is continuing behind the scenes to form a new government after Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned.Some of the main demands emerging in Lebanon are for an independent cabinet not backed by any political parties, and for an independent investigation into the port explosion.

The UK has had a recession and Northern Ireland is in the same boat.# Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeAugust   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNow we know. The UK has had a recession and Northern Ireland is in the same boat. UK Gross Domestic Productdeclined by .% from January to March. Normally that would have been a terrible result, but that was nothing compared to a further .% decline which followed from April to June. Total output in the UK economy in the second quarter was .% down on the end of . The UK#s Covid-related recession has been worse than that in France, Germany, Italy and the USA. Only Spain was slightly worse. A % GDP reduction would be the worst recession since , topping even the Great Depression of -. You have to go back to the calamitous years of - to find something comparable. None of this is a surprise given the extent to which lockdown shut down the economy whilst international travel was reduced to a trickle. Most service sectors experienced output declines of about one-fth in the first half of the year. The decline in retail was slightly worse than that. In tourism and catering the reduction was about %. For the glass half full person there are a few glimmers of hope in the data. Although unemployment continues to rise, in a technical sense recovery began back in May when GDP rose by about %. This was followed by a rebound of .% in June. The critical question is how long it will take us to get back to the pre-lockdown output level. This is highly uncertain given many imponderables: further spikes of the virus, when will a vaccine be available, what sort of trading relationship is the UK going to have with the EU from the start of , and what happens to the world economy. Some forecasters think it will take the UK economy four to five years to regain  levels. After the last recession in - the NI economy took at least seven years. It seems reasonable to allow for at least five years to get us back to where we were in December . The challenge for both the private sector and government is immense. Public health considerations notwithstanding, the Executive seems to have decided that fundamentally health needs wealth. They have lted lockdown more rapidly than their Scottish and Welsh counterparts. Lockdown#s achievement was fewer Covid fatalities and reduced strain on the NHS. On other hand, we can now see just how deep the lockdown recession will be. We really cannot afford another general lockdown which costs the economy billions and also reduces well-being in all sorts of ways. We do not know when a vaccine will be available but the priority must be alternative ways of containing a second wave such as test and trace, track and trace and very localised lockdowns. Here are some further policy suggestions: Foreign direct investment opportunities: as businesses source at home Invest NI could market the region as a safer location for GB foreign investment.Sectoral change: manufacturing could gain and the planning and rates system could be used to promote city centre living. Adapt to changing tourism patterns: opportunities could emerge for more staycations. Re-skilling during furlough: encourage more e-learning and take the opportunity to reform scrap the often ineffective Apprenticeship Levy. NI#s next Programme for Government could be simplied to prioritise productivity and competitiveness. Whatever happens in terms of the virus or Brexit, these remain our key priorities.Dr Esmond Birnie is Senior Economist at the Ulster University Business School  Belfast   Most ReadGuess who#s not coming to dinner: Hard hit NI restaurants plagued by no showsBelfast bonfire disorder: Images released in police appealHe turned our lives upside down.

The facility would link up with the new Magee medical school to train future doctors. The Derry News has learned that plans for a ‘capital build’ project at the Derry hospital are at an ‘early stage’ but have been costed. The development comes shortly after the news emerged on Friday that Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical Schoolis now recruiting students for September  intake. The Western Trust has and will be the main partner to the medical school. Professor Louise Dubras, who will lead the course, appeared at a Western Trust board meeting to update members on the GEMS on August . googletag.cmd.push Speaking at the meeting, Mr Alan Moore, Director of Strategic Capital Development, offered a ‘hearty congratulations’ to Prof. Dubras. He made reference to on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital which were included in the business case. In response, Prof. Dubras said: “We costed in to our business case the requirement for a capital build at Altnagelvin Hospital to determine the amount of money that would be required for that. “What our expectation is, is that we wish to work with the Trust and Queen’s University Belfastto have a building which serves everybody and I think it’s really important that this is not two universities, two buildings and duplication of everything. googletag.cmd.push “We’re not big enough to do that and it doesn’t provide good education, the only way that this will work well as we move forward is to have a provision which covers all undergraduate education and that enables post-grad activity to take place there. “That’s really important for students to see and work with foundation year doctors and doctors at other stages of their training so that what you have as a Trust is a culture of education and growing educational excellence in the area – and a single place, which is the hub, is where it needs to happen.” TENACITY Addressing the meeting on behalf of the Trust, Dr Catherine McDonnell expressed her admiration for Prof. Dubras’ ‘patience and tenacity’ over the past two years for ‘sticking with the project’ to deliver a medical school in the North West. She said it is ‘extremely important’ to the hospital in terms of stabilising the medical workforce and creating local jobs. To clear up some ‘confusion’ there may be about the nature of the medical school Prof. Dubras pointed out that it’s not a post-graduate medical school for people who are qualied as doctors and doing a master’s degree. She explained that this school will accept students who will be trained as doctors and their degree could have been in any subject as long as they achieved a :. It will be situated within the faculty of Le and Health Sciences. “The medical school is about supporting local young people and improving the economic potential of the region and tackling long-term social deprivation.” Work is ongoing to refurbish buildings at the Magee campus in readiness for students next year. Prof. Dubras said staff recruitment is an interesting area and people have already expressed an interest in coming to Derry to work. Chairman of the Western Trust board, Sam Pollock, said he believes the medical school will help attract staff to address the ongoing issue of agency costs. Director of Performance and Service Improvement, Mrs Teresa Molloy, said there has been extensive interest from partner organisations such as Fermanagh and Omagh Council about the long-term benefits it could bring. EARLY STAGE In , the Department of Health commissioned a Review of Medical School Places which recommended that Northern Ireland needs  more medical students a year to meet the increasing demand for doctors. At last weeks meeting Prof. Dubras pointed out how the medical school will start off with  students and discussions are continuing with The Executive Office to increase that to . Currently, approximately % of medical graduates in Northern Ireland tend to stay and live within  miles of Queen’s University Belfast after graduation, according to the GMC. The new School of Medicine at Magee will address departmental recommendations by providing access to medical education in the North West, positioning theDerryCity region as an attractive place to study and work. Students will benefit from access to clinical placements across the full range of general practice, medical and surgical specialities with primary care-based experience from week one. This will enable students to develop knowledge and appreciation of the interconnectivity between primary, secondary, social and community-based healthcare. A spokesperson for Ulster University confirmed: “Ulster University continues to engage with local partners including the Western Health and Social Care Trust on medical education. “Discussions around joint additional training sites are at a very early stage and no plans have yet been agreed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new vaccine research registrywill help large numbers of people to be recruited into trials over the coming months, potentially leading to an effective vaccine being identied and made available to the UK public against coronavirus sooner. It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies. By collecting details about people who are interested in taking part in vaccine studies, the registry service will help cut down the time it takes to find volunteers for vaccine studies. This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK. To register, people fill in some personal and contact details, and answer a series of basic health screening questions on an NHS web form atwww.nhs.uk researchcontact. googletag.cmd.push   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk, who helped instigate the initiative, said the cost of school unorm can be a problem for some families. “I firmly believe unorms are a hidden cost of education,” she said. “Branded blazers and jumpers can be extremely expensive and beyond the reach of some families, but they are mandatory in most schools and that leaves parents in a dficult situation.” A survey completed by the Irish League of Credit Unions found that % of parents found school costs a financial burden. googletag.cmd.push It indicated % of parents get into debt for back to school costs, while % of those have used payday or doorstep loan providers. Cllr McGurk added: “This program aims to help local families reduce the cost of purchasing unorms. “However, we are relying on the generosity of the local community to donate items of unorm which are in good condition and are no longer needed by their own family. “We would appeal to all families whose children have moved out of school, or outgrown items of unorm, to donate to the program at any on the drop off points advertised in social media.” googletag.cmd.push Once items are received and sorted, families will have an opportunity to book an appointment to pick up items they need at Benbradagh Community Support or Hands That Talk.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has seven or eight rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Of that number, the most popular setting for wearing a face covering was the supermarket, with % of respondents indicating they had worn their covering there. Petrol stations and local shops were the next highest on .%, with hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons close behind on .%.  Just % said they had worn a covering on public transport, where they have been compulsory since July , while .% of those who took part in the survey said they never wore one. googletag.cmd.push Asked to comment on face coverings, many of those opposed to wearing one said they didn’t feel it would have any impact on the spread of the virus. One respondent said: “I really dont think they are necessary. Wearing them is not effective. Hand washing  social distancing are the best preventative measures. Others felt the issue should be a matter of personal choice, with one respondent stating, ‘it should be a choice, not an order’. “If it’s not safe enough to go out without a face mask then its not safe enough to go out period. The number of people with ill-fitting masks is unbelievable,” said another. “Gaping holes, noses uncovered, constantly adjusting them with their hands are all defeating the purpose of the masks.”  Protecting the vulnerable was a motivator for many of those who were in favour of mandatory face coverings. “We should protect each other as best we can. Currently the advice is that face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-, so take responsibility and wear one,” said one respondent. Some also felt that coverings should have been mandatory since the start of lockdown, while others who are shielding said the lack of face coverings makes them anxious. “I dont see enough people wearing them coming out of shielding myself,” said one respondent. “I feel really unsafe and anxious about going into enclosed places as it is with my mask on so when people are not wearing them it concerns me and my safety.” As the requirement came into force yesterday, the NI Executive launched their ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign, stressing the move was to make things safer for everyone.  A joint statement said: “The use of face coverings is a vital defence in our battle against Covid-. “This is about looking after each other and doing everything we can to stay on top of this virus. It will help to save lives. “It also has to be remembered that some people cannot wear face coverings, due to a disability or health condition. “There should be no stigma attached to anyone in these circumstances. If those of us who can cover up do so, then it will help keep everyone safe. “We are confident most people will comply, but those who do not wear a face covering without a reasonable excuse risk being issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said making face coverings mandatory was a positive step. “I welcome the move to make face coverings mandatory, and I think that we all should be doing whatever we can to minimise risks to ourselves and others,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across

not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to

Most of Europe was basking in a heatwav and race morning arrived with temperatures already at  degrees.The race statistics were scary with , metres of climbing to be covered in only .km race distance. The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place. Then with less than m nearly vertical metres to go, he surged past Cachard to move into thirrd place and crossed the line in  minutes and  seconds. The winner, Aymonod, was home in : with Magnini second in :. Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

Please try again later.Submitting...Minecraft is a game full of mystery to meAnd generally I leave it at that, surmising perhaps that his impatience is a symptom of youth and that a time will come in the future when he’s happy to sit with his silly old dad and watch a few balls being potted, or even a test match in cricket, or a rugby international.But this year something dferent occurs to me. When I was the age my boy is now I had already got my first miniature snooker table from Santa and played on it until the cloth was worn out.When I was the same age my boy is now I was deeply engrossed in the drama of watching Alex Higgins become world champion in .The conclusion is hard to avoid, my son is not interested in the things which occupy my thoughts. For him, the preferred leisure activities are an array of computer games, which are as much an impenetrable mystery to me as snooker is to him.And I feel a stab of regret at the realisation. The link which I so cherish refuses to form, the opportunity for shared experience is denied.I suppose there is a part of me which always looked forward to recounting to him the magnicence of Higgins’ achievement almost four decades ago.How, facing elimination in the semi final against a baby-faced Jimmy White, the Belfast man completed the greatest and gutsiest clearance in the history of the sport. How he potted a blue ball and then screwed the cue ball back to near the black spot in an act of motion which defied all the known laws of science. How a deeply flawed inidual, driven by a scowling intensity, performed a feat of courage and nerve which meant, in that moment, a game which should really mean nothing, seemed to mean everything. How those few moments were to define the man’s le’s work and character. There is no drug more powerful than nostalgia and I long to share what I experienced.But it is not to be. Instead I remain silent and nod along as my son breathlessly recounts to me his latest achievements in the game Minecraft, telling me over and over of a mysterious world of dragons, zombies and portals. Sometimes he sits beside me as he plays and I watch sport. So close together but moving in dferent directions.Then another latent memory stirs from somewhere deep. It is of my own father and his lelong fascination with machinery. How, when I was a little boy, so much of his time and thoughts were dominated with tractors and diggers. It was an obsession I was never to share or understand.I remember on New Year’s Day my da would always go to a ploughing match somewhere in rural County Antrim. Occasionally I would accompany him, trailing behind as my little wellies would get stuck in a muddy field. An array of brightly-coloured tractors moved earth up and down in straight lines while serious-faced men in flat caps watched and smoked. And throughout I would think about how alien and stuffy it all seemed.Sometimes we would travel to agricultural shows and my da would spend what seemed to be an age studying freshly painted machines and speaking to like-minded peers while my brothers and I would whine about wanting to go the playground.Now I consider that there may have been an inkling of what I am feeling now within my own father. A desire within him for his interests to overlap with mine, so he could pass on what he knew down through the generations. But I remained stubbornly resistant, preferring my own world of imagination, of writing stories, and of snooker, cricket and rugby. I consider how patient my da must have been to listen to that young boy waffling on for hours about sports that he never really cared about.Which brings me back to where I started, watching snooker while the rain patters the driveway outside. My son is beside me playing Minecraft. This time I try a dferent question.‘Hey buddy, what’s going on in your game ’He eyes me suspiciously at first.‘I’m trying to build a portal daddy, but I can’t get it to work. Can you help me ’I’m hesitant, because I know this is not my world. But I take the iPad and begin, for the first time, to study the game where landscapes are created out of square blocks. After a very long time I work out that my son has placed one block in the wrong direction, which prevents the portal from opening. I correct it and he yelps with delight.‘Thanks daddy! Now can you give me back the iPad ’He goes back to his game. I go back to my snooker. Our interests may dfer, but there is enough commonality to make the whole thing work. We don’t exchange many words in the next hour, but after a while he reaches across and puts his small hand into mine. We stay just like that.He sees the world in a dferent way than I do, just like I saw it dferently than my own da when I was a boy. Some day my son may develop some interest in sport and I’ll be able to pass on my memories of the legendary feats of Alex Higgins, although I now accept that it’s unlikely. After all I always remained stubbornly resistant to the charms of ploughing matches. But it’s ok, because it’s better that he digs his own furrow in le.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

last year, after five years of landscape preparation.Large blue butterflies have a remarkable le cycle, which involves the larvae tricking a particular species of red ant into carrying them into their nest where they feed on ant grubs before emerging the next year as butterflies. vw,vw,px, px\"The large blue vanished from Rodborough Commons, Gloucestershire,  years ago The species was declared extinct in Britain in , but was first reintroduced from populations on the continent nearly  years ago and has been established at a number of sites across southern England.Key to successful reintroductions has been creating the right conditions for the Myrmica sabuleti ant species and encouraging growth of wild thyme and marjoram, which the butterfly feeds and lays its eggs on.The scheme at Minchinhampton and Rodborough Commons is the largest ever reintroduction of large blues in the UK.Some , were larvae taken from other West Country locations and released last August on the -acre site owned by the National Trust.An estimated  butterflies have successfully emerged at the site over the summer,and the team members monitoring the scheme have recorded large blues mating and eggs

follows work to prepare the site by partners including the National Trust, Butterfly Conservation, Limestonersquos Living Legacies Back from the Brink project, Natural England, Royal Entomological Societyand the Minchinhampton and Rodborough Committees of Commoners.Small temporary grazing areas were created using electric fences, to allow cows including Luing, Hereford and long-horn cattle to graze slopes to provide the right conditions for the ants, and a programme of scrub control was carried out.\" srcset\"https:content.assets.pressassociation.io    db-b-f-aa-dbdcb.jpg w,

management plan, said: ldquoThe butterfly needs high densities of the heat-loving red ant Myrmica sabuleti, which has a crucial role to play in the lecycle of the butterfly.ldquoThe grazing cows create the ideal conditions for them by keeping the grass down so sunlight can reach the soil which gently warms it, creating perfect conditions for the ants, which are cold-blooded and therefore need warmth in order to actively scout for food throughout the spring, summer and autumn.In summer, the butterfly larvae deceive the ants into thinking they are their own young and carrying them into the nest to complete their le cycle by feeding on the ant grubs until they are ready to pupate and emerge.The grassland commons are also home to fourteen species of orchid, rare pasqueflowers, Duke of Burgundy butterfly and rock rose pot beetles.But amid the success of the reintroduction, the National Trust is warning that the coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on the charityrsquos finances just as it is focusing on nature and climate emergencies.Ben McCarthy, head of nature conservation and restoration ecology, said: ldquoNow, more than ever, we need support so that we can
