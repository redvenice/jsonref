Pictured: A container ship docked at a Qingdao port on July 6Washington imposed 25 percent duties on $34billion of Chinese goods on July 6 in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing retaliated by imposing similar charges on the same amount of US products.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Friday that \u0027instead of retaliating, China should address longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices\u0027.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman had earlier called on Washington to \u0027come to its senses\u0027 and settle the dispute.NRA has gone BROKE and \u0027may soon be unable to exist\u0027, court...Share this articleChinese leaders have offered to narrow their politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States by purchasing more American goods, but they have rejected changing technology development plans they see as a path to prosperity and global influence.There\u0027s no end in sight, and the dispute could chill global trade and economic growth.China\u0027s new threat targeting a smaller amount of US goods reflects the fact that Beijing is running out of products for retaliation due to its lopsided trade balance with the United States.China\u0027s imports from the United States last year totaled $153.9billion. After the earlier tariffs $34billion of US goods, about $120billion is available for retaliation.The highest penalties on the new list would be imposed on honey, vegetables, mushrooms and chemicals, targeting farming and mining areas that supported President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.The new list includes products as varied as snow blowers and 3D printers, suggesting Chinese authorities are struggling to find enough imports their own economy can do without.          White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a briefing Friday that \u0027instead of retaliating, China should address longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices\u0027Beijing\u0027s earlier round of tariffs appeared designed to minimize the impact on the Chinese economy by targeting soybeans, whiskey and other goods available from Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.Trump initially proposed 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200billion of Chinese imports, but he told trade officials this week to consider raising that to 25 percent. It will be September at the earliest before the U.S. decides whether to impose those tariffs.Chinese authorities warned earlier that if the dispute escalated, they would adopt unspecified \u0027comprehensive measures.\u0027 That prompted concern among American companies that retaliation might expand to disrupting their operations in China.The United States and China have the world\u0027s biggest trading relationship but official ties are increasingly strained over complaints that Beijing\u0027s technology development tactics hurt American companies.Trump\u0027s tariffs target goods the White House says benefit from industrial policies such as \u0027Made in China 2025\u0027, which calls for developing Chinese competitors in robotic, artificial intelligence and other fields.The dispute is part of broader US complaints about global trading conditions that have prompted Trump to raise duties on steel, aluminum, washing machines or solar panels from Canada, Europe, Japan and South Korea.A spokesman for China\u0027s foreign ministry appealed to Washington to negotiate but could not confirm reports the two sides were setting up talks.\u0027We urge the United States to come to its senses, correct its erroneous acts and create the necessary condition for a proper settlement as soon as possible,\u0027 spokesman Geng Shuang said.Trump campaigned on a promise to bring down America\u0027s massive trade deficits by renegotiating trade agreements and getting tough on countries like China that sell the U.S. far more than they buy from it.But the US Commerce Department reported Friday that the American trade deficit climbed to $46.3billion in June from $43.2billion in May. The deficit in goods trade with China also rose. So far this year, the trade gap is up more than seven percent from January-June 2017."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/03/16/4ECA920B00000578-0-image-a-51_1533308873669.jpg","title":"Seven week old walrus calf makes public appearance German zoo","story":"    A baby walrus has made its first public appearance at a German zoo alongside its mother, and appeared to have a great time as it was watch by adoring crowds          The seven-week-old mammal, who is not yet named, swam in the enclosure\u0027s pool  under the watchful eye of its mother Dina at Hagenbeck Zoo in Hamburg          Mother and son went swimming together with the adult giving her calf a nudge when needed to guide him around the pool          However, he appeared to already be a good swimmer able to follow his mother around in formationHe also got a pat from one of the keepers who came in to feed the pair from a bucket likely containing fish.\u0027He is in a good mood and already eats like a big guy in terms of quantity,\u0027 veterinarian Adriane Prahl said.

I want you to find your happiness.\u0027Markle used her blog as a platform to express her feelings about her personal life and past experiences growing up as well. In one post, she described the ‘constant battle’ of her ‘brutal’ 20s that involved incessantly judging her own weight and style choices.           Markle used her now-defunct blog to express personal feelings and recount past experiences\u0027My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as coolas hipas smartas “whatever” as everyone else.\u0027My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant. My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls.\u0027Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. So every day during lunch, I busied myself with meetings – French club, student body, whatever one could possibly do between noon and 1pm, I was there. Not so that I was more involved, but so that I wouldn’t have to eat alone,’ she wrote.For her birthday, Markle is reportedly planning to celebrate in Surrey at the wedding of Daisy Jenks and Charlie Van Straubenzee, one of Prince Harry’s best friends who also served as an usher at the Royal Wedding.Per Royal tradition, birthdays are usually low-key affairs celebrated at home. A notable exception is Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrates two birthdays in April and June.August 4 is also notable in the Royal Family as its marks what would’ve been the 118th birthday of the late Queen Mother, who was born on that date in 1900.Who is Doria Ragland?Doria Ragland is the mother of Meghan Markle.She was born in Cleveland, Ohio in September, 1956.          Doria Ragland, right, worked as a makeup artist when she met Thomas Markle, Meghan\u0027s fatherShortly after she was born, her family relocated to Los Angeles, California and she later worked as a makeup artist after graduating from high school. While working on the TV show General Hospital, she met her future husband Thomas Markle, whom she married on December 23, 1979.Ragland gave birth to her daughter Meghan in 1981, though she and her husband later orced in 1987. However, they remained friends and both helped to raise their daughter.Ragland later worked as a travel agent and obtained a Bachelor of the Arts degree in psychology. She later became a licensed social worker in 2015 after attaining a Master of Social Work from the University of Southern California.

When the cost of a degree can be up to £60,000, can it ever make financial sense — especially when the great majority of students (nine out of ten, on some courses) will be unable to find a job that requires a university education?Changes have to be made, and now. Unless university places are restricted, our great institutions will be reduced to nurseries for over-qualified baristas, gym trainers and call centre workers.We can’t wait for the academics to come to their senses and start turning away undergraduates — their jobs depend on filling those places.Thankfully, the new Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, seems determined to do something about it. This week, he gave a speech in which he argued that more pupils should think about shunning university for alternatives, such as high-quality apprenticeships.He argued that youngsters, both working-class and middle-class, could benefit more from the Government’s new technical qualifications — known as ‘T-levels’ — which are being set up as an alternative to A-levels.Mr Hinds said: ‘We need to consider whether in all cases a traditional degree at university is the right option, including those from more affluent backgrounds.’What is remarkable is that it even needs to be said.The fact is that many graduates now see minimal or even negative returns from their degrees.Figures from the Office of National Statistics revealed recently that a third of graduates from some of the most popular degree courses in the country — including agriculture, psychology, English and creative design — are likely to be earning substantially less than the national average salary.And that’s true not just immediately after leaving university, but five years later.While the average UK salary is £27,600 a year, an ex-student with a degree in education, for example, is likely to be earning £23,700 — nearly £4,000 less.Yet every parent wants their child to go to university.That’s not an exaggeration: an Institute of Education study in 2010 found that 97 per cent of British mothers with children aged ten and under wished to see them go on to further education.          Universities are making thousands of unconditional offers - but this has been criticised as the higher education system swellsNo one is willing to recognise the blatant disadvantages of the failing system . . . and it’s hardly surprising. Too many people have too much at stake.There are more than 160 different universities and H.E. colleges in the UK today — many with multiple campuses — serving 2.32 million students, equivalent to the combined populations of Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham and Derby. They employ 400,000 people. Add those figures together, and they represent around 5 per cent of the UK’s entire population.Tony Blair’s New Labour government pledged to send half of all school leavers to university. But this bloat has its beginnings much earlier, in the Sixties. The post-war population boom and the success of the grammar schools were producing far more highly able candidates than universities could accommodate.A government report in 1963 recommended: ‘Courses should be available to all those who are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and who wish to do so.’The author, Lord Robbins, could not have imagined what his well-meaning proposal would set in motion.Today, more than 600,000 people apply for degrees every year. They surely cannot all be ‘qualified by ability and attainment’. The figures certainly suggest that they are not. In 2010, 51 per cent of university applicants had three grade Ds at A-level or worse. And there are places for them.Some establishments, mainly the newer ones, have been so desperate to fill up their courses that they have made huge numbers of unconditional offers to sixth-formers, which give prospective students guaranteed university places regardless of the outcome of their A-levels.Figures released last week by the Universities And Colleges Admissions Service show that universities made 67,915 unconditional offers this year — a staggering rise since the 2,985 given out in 2014.Schoolteachers have voiced concern that these unconditional offers are being dished out ‘like candy’.This removes the motivation to work, they say: ‘It affects performance,’ said one, who didn’t want to be named. ‘I would say that pupils with unconditional offers drop at least a grade.’Others regard it as a form of corruption: ‘That looks very much like bribery . . . “Come here, because you don’t need any grades.” ’The inevitable result is that, rather than attracting the finest young minds in the country, our universities are becoming breeding grounds for third-rate thought.Hundreds evacuated in central Virginia over fears dam could...Sleep really is the best medicine: How getting less than six...Has Malia Obama inherited her dad\u0027s weakness for nicotine?...Share this articleOnce, they produced young people with inquisitive, independent, open, questioning intellects.Now, the opposite is happening. The past decade has seen a worrying rise in the scale and intensity of self-censorship at universities, and an increasing demand for ‘safe spaces’ where students will be protected from any views that might disturb their intellectual, political and moral comfort zones.Students are imposing gender segregation, banning national newspapers, demanding the removal of statues they find offensive and, as occurred last month at Manchester University, defacing and painting out the text of the poem If by Nobel prize-winner Rudyard Kipling because the author was perceived as a racist.The famous verse was replaced with some lines by black American feminist Maya Angelou.Anything that could be construed as ‘cultural appropriation’ is stamped out, even down to the naming of foreign dishes in university canteens, and speakers as erse as Germaine Greer, Peter Tatchell and Nigel Farage have been denied a platform as a consequence of holding views deemed beyond the pale.In 2016, the magazine Spiked, which monitors censorship on campus, found that 90 per cent of British universities now place restrictions on freedom of expression.If that sounds unlike the heady, free-thinking days of yore, so is every other aspect of undergraduate life.With accommodation scarce and expensive, and the prospect of future unemployment ever more real, the student existence is no longer a three-year party. Instead, it can be expensive, difficult and isolating — causing a steep rise in mental illness, even suicide in the most tragic cases.Those who arrive with hopes of intense intellectual debate are quickly disillusioned: other students often lack interest and ability, and academics have no time to engage.In many departments, courses are so crowded that it is now the norm for each student to have just one face-to-face meeting with a tutor per term.There are also a large number of international students. It’s no surprise: — many universities are so eager to take students from abroad, and to charge them up to £100,000 in tuition fees over three years, that proficiency in English is no longer seen as necessary.One mature student told a House Of Commons Select Committee, as long ago as 2009: ‘The varying ability of the students and their poor English meant things had to be pitched to the lowest common denominator.‘One of my lecturers was being asked to slow his lectures down so that the significant number of Chinese students could follow what he was saying.‘His speed was fine for native speakers, so I would assume that any slowing down will have an impact on the material covered.’It all has an impact, of course. The inevitable result is that many graduates emerge with third-rate degrees in less than useful subjects from often third-rate institutions — and realise to their horror that what might be the most expensive purchase of their lives, apart from property (if they can ever buy a house), is worthless.Graduates with useless degrees are so numerous that one in ten childminders has a university education. So does one in six call centre staff, and one in four air cabin crew and theme park attendants.This can create bigger problems than mere frustration and bitterness. A former intensive care nurse, Rona Johnson, told the Mail in 2009: ‘Many graduate nurses feel they are too superior to clean floors and change beds.  Tony Blair’s New Labour government pledged to send half of all school leavers to university ‘Many less glamorous but vital elements of nursing have dropped off the syllabus, to be replaced with empty jargon about “holistic care” and “cultural sensitivities”.‘As a result, the incidence of lethal hospital infections is going through the roof.’The cost of all these useless degrees is almost beyond calculating. Each year students borrow over £12 billion. The total debt owed by UK graduates and undergrads is thought to be £100 billion.As a result, an entire generation will spend the first 30 years of their lives struggling with debts they cannot repay. The average debt of a British graduate is £50,000, the highest in the developed world.An income tax surcharge of up to nine per cent will be imposed on those who do manage to find well-paying jobs. This will prevent many from buying their own homes, getting married and starting families. Then, after 30 years, the remaining debt will be written off, at the cost of untold tens of billions to the taxpayer.All this financial grief is quite pointless. It is the mathematics of the madhouse.How do we end it? The most obvious first step is to gradually reduce the number of students — say, by five per cent per year for five years. This would reduce overcrowding on courses and increase the amount of contact between tutors and students.How can this be achieved? Well, for one thing, a minimum grade tariff should be set for access to student loans. Currently, a school leaver with just one grade E at A-level can claim a place at a new university — though they are likely to struggle academically, and quite probably drop out.Why should they automatically qualify for student finance when it’s so likely that the bill will eventually fall to the taxpayer?If an applicant cannot demonstrate a minimum level of attainment and ability, why should there be an automatic expectation of funding? It’s worse than ludicrous that a student capable of nothing better than one E-grade should be burdened with £50,000 — it’s cruel.(It also emerged this week that middle-class parents of students are being hit with a ‘stealth tax’ of up to £4,000 a year to pay for their child’s rent because rooms at some of the most popular universities cost far more than the maintenance loans available.)Of COURSE, low achievers with a genuine desire to better their education should not be denied the chance of tertiary education. Pupils can fail at school for all sorts of reasons, not all their own fault.          University graduates are not necessarily earning more than those who did not take degree courses, it has been foundThose with weak grades could be offered part-time education, initially with one credit for a module at the Open University. By passing that module, they could earn access to more funding, and so on.Student headcount could also be reduced by withdrawing or restricting funding for courses and universities with high drop-out rates and low levels of post-grad employment or earnings. At the very least, those courses should have to face a few pertinent questions.Do they offer the country some sort of benefit, perhaps improving our cultural life, that justifies the burden on taxpayers — ordinary working people whose hard-earned cash goes to pay for abandoned studies?Does the university make extra efforts to support mature students, who perhaps dropped out years or decades ago but who now want to tackle education in earnest?Does it have an especially good record with people from disadvantaged backgrounds, those with disabilities or from communities in the UK’s remoter areas?If the answer to all those is ‘No’, there’s an even more important question: why should we keep wasting public money? And there’s a simple answer: withdraw funding.Above all, Britain has to shake off the delusion that half our school leavers are better off going to university. It’s a monstrous con. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/04/01/4ECED65D00000578-6025143-image-m-98_1533342921805.jpg","title":"Mines double Theyre supermarket spirits brazenly copy classics","story":"Caversham Pale Cream sherry is more than £5 cheaper than Croft Original SherryTwin Gins Oliver Cromwell London Dry Gin 70cl, £9.99, AldiFrom the green bottle to the curly ‘G’, this looks like a close relative of Gordon’s.

Pit accidents were common I remember him saying how often they’d hear the siren, warning of an accident. And when he was seven, that siren rang for his father Joe, who was killed in a collapse.His mother remarried soon after and the family moved south, to Coventry. But their new stepfather was a violent man. By the age of 13, Dad felt he had to leave home. He told me he felt he might have killed his stepfather if he’d stayed.Taking his younger brother with him, Dad moved back to Scotland to live with their uncle, and found work in the local pit. It was the start of World War II and mining was a protected industry, so he was never called up to fight.After the war, Dad worked as a waiter at Butlins Holiday Camp at Filey in Yorkshire, and later at another camp at Portelet Bay, Jersey — which is where, in 1949, he met my mother Olive, then 19. It was love at first sight for them both.Dad moved to London to find work and to be near Olive, and they married in 1952, settling in Hounslow. At Mum’s suggestion, he began to study maths and engineering at night school, so he could find work as a tooling engineer.She also encouraged him to join her ballroom dancing lessons, which became a lifelong shared passion. They were a fixture in the world of ballroom and knew Len Goodman, the former Strictly judge.

So when he was told to sign an eviction notice for an overcrowded property in Chiswick — Britain’s first home for battered wives, founded by Erin Pizzey — he refused.He was warned he might be prosecuted and go to prison, but Dad knew what life was like in a violent home and he stood firm, appearing on Thames Television’s Today programme to explain how important these sanctuaries were.He remained a friend of the Chiswick Women’s Aid movement, now known as Refuge, all his life. When the charity celebrated its 45th anniversary at the House of Lords in 2017, Dad and Mum were invited.Dad’s career in local government flourished and in 1978, he and Mum were selected as Mayor and Mayoress of Hounslow.His family, though, was the centre of his life and he was a loving father to my elder brother Kerry and me, and adoring grandfather to his four grandchildren.Dad and Mum retired to Windlesham in Surrey, where they continued to dance. When Mum developed dementia, Dad was happy to be her carer. He always credited her with ‘saving his life’ by encouraging him to study and better himself.Dad’s death was unexpected, following a routine heart operation.

Blame my brilliant friend! MY COLLEAGUE NUALAby Richard ColferIf you find yourself scratching your head over the Giant Crossword on page 62 of today’s Mail, I hope you’ll spare a thought for Nuala. For the past 25 years she has been compiling that puzzle every Saturday, a run that will only come to an end in December when the final one, her 1,248th, which she completed before her death at the age of 90 last month, will be published.It all started 72 years ago. Shortly after the war, Nuala was working as an air hostess when she met Brian Considine, a pilot from Limerick who had been wounded in the Battle of Britain.Brian introduced her to cryptic crosswords and they subsequently compiled one together. To their joy and surprise, it was published by the Irish News when Nuala was still just 18.In the more than seven decades since, she is thought to have compiled more crosswords than anyone else in history.She was born Aisling Fionnuala Maire Kiernan on October 10, 1927, in London, the second of four children of Delia Kiernan, a noted Irish folk singer, and Dr Thomas J. Kiernan, a diplomat and later Ireland’s ambassador to West Germany and the U.S.          Nuala Considine is thought to have compiled more crosswords than anyone else in history. Notably shunning the use of computers — she preferred instead to design grids by hand to go alongside the neat, witty clues that were her hallmarkShe married Brian in 1948 and joined the press and puzzles agency Morley Adams Ltd (now part of the Press Association) in Fleet Street in 1955, where she worked for the rest of her life.In that time she compiled crosswords for a range of newspapers including the Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph and Daily Express (for some years setting all their daily cryptics single-handed).Once, when she was compiling a crossword called ‘The Stinker’ for the Weekend Mail, a group of people who used to try to tackle it together became so frustrated that they wrote to the paper asking for a photograph of the setter to put on their dartboard. The request was politely refused.She and Brian never had children and after his death in 1996 she carried on compiling, notably shunning the use of computers — she preferred instead to design grids by hand to go alongside the neat, witty clues that were her hallmark.I will remember her as a kind woman, ready with encouraging words and helpful advice, who loved splitting her time between Britain and her second home in San Diego.Even in her 80s she remained fit and active, showing amazing speed in providing a cup of tea and a slice of cake for guests, zipping up and down her stairs with ease.To hear that she had been diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer was an enormous shock, but Nuala accepted it with great dignity.Her funeral in London on Friday, July 27, was attended by many family members and friends, from crosswords and beyond, who couldn’t resist swapping stories in the pub afterwards.All I can say is that if her story has inspired you to try her crossword, please do! You won’t find a better one.Nuala Considine, born October 10, 1927, died July 24, 2018, aged 90.  Aaron\u0027s smile was a tonic for all who met him MY SON AARONby John MollittWhenever I think of my son Aaron, it’s his huge smile that comes to mind first. He was such a happy person — yet so disabled that he couldn’t even say hello.But Aaron had a way with him. Pushing him in his wheelchair through our tiny village of Ingleton in the Yorkshire Dales could take a couple of hours because everyone wanted to stop and see how he was.And that wonderful smile was such a tonic that I often took him with me when I visited hospitals in my role as a minister of Ingleton Evangelical Church. His presence seemed to be uplifting for others.The great tragedy was that when Aaron was born in August 1987, he was a healthy baby. His multiple disorders — spastic quadriplegia, epilepsy, severe spinal curvature and visual impairment — were caused when he was just four weeks old, by his violent biological father, a heroin addict.My wife Pat and I fostered him, intending to keep him for a year. We had two children and had fostered babies before. But Aaron had such profound needs that he became a full-time job for my wife.          Aaron Mollitt had profound disabilities, but his pleasures were simple. He loved being pushed in his wheelchair, to breathe fresh air and feel the breeze on his faceAnd somehow he became family, and our fostering role just kept going until, in 2004, when Aaron was 16, we adopted him.Of course, doctors warned us that Aaron’s health was not compatible with a long life. He had repeated chest infections and often needed hospital treatment. But Aaron was a fighter and kept defying the odds.He attended a special school in Carnforth until he was 18 and was very happy there. After he left, I took early retirement and we spent another happy decade together — he became a familiar figure at churches I visited, football and cricket matches, brass band concerts — in fact, everywhere we went.Great kindness was shown to us because of Aaron. One afternoon, we were having coffee and scones in a cafe but when we went to settle the bill, we were told the staff had had a whip-round and there was nothing to pay.When Aaron finally succumbed to a chest infection, the family was devastated.For someone with such profound disabilities, his pleasures were simple. He loved being pushed in his wheelchair, to breathe fresh air and feel the breeze on his face.And that’s how we remember him now, with an annual family walk up Ingleborough peak. We miss Aaron every day but we are so thankful for the years we spent with him.Aaron Luke Mollitt, born August 30, 1987, died May 18, 2016, aged 28.  Our \u0027Magic Mary\u0027 made crazy ideas come true MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW MARY MCDOWELLby Oenone McDowellEveryone knew my daughter-in-law as ‘Magic Mary’ because she could conjure up miracles out of thin air. She just had that knack of making the craziest ideas a reality.And the best example of that was when she and her friend Claire organised a huge fundraising event called the Pink Tie Ball for charity. They persuaded Sittingbourne Golf Club to host it free, then arranged wonderful auction prizes, including a VIP box at the Manchester United football ground. They raised more than £9,000 for the Medway Maritime Hospital.Sadly, the only magic trick Mary couldn’t pull off was beating breast cancer, although for ten years she gave it everything she had.Mary was born in Gillingham, Kent, the only girl in a family of seven and perhaps that’s why she grew up sports-mad, especially football (Gillingham FC) and playing netball and badminton.          Everyone knew my daughter-in-law Mary McDowell, pictured here with husband Rob, as ‘Magic Mary’ because she could conjure up miracles out of thin air She met my son Rob and there was a special bond between us from the start. I even made her wedding dress — a fashionable, bouffant affair (pictured).They went on to have two children, Samantha, born in 1988, and Ben, two years later. To celebrate, Rob bought her a gold necklace from a local jeweller. To their shock and delight, it turned out to be one that had been stolen from her in a burglary a year or two before.With her own children at school, Mary trained as a teaching assistant. She had left with few exam passes herself, but was in her element helping others.As a family, they loved camping and caravanning, taking their children to festivals and open-air concerts all over the country. At home, they hosted wonderful barbecues for the family. It seemed a charmed life to all of us.So when Mary was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, it was devastating news. But she was typically upbeat, although realistic: ‘I know this thing is going to get me,’ she said to me once, ‘but not yet.’Mary McDowell, born March 18, 1960, died January 27, 2018, aged 57. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/04/04/4ECF35F700000578-6025533-image-m-25_1533352960473.jpg","title":"Samantha Markle wishes half sister Meg happy birthday","story":"    Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha wished the duchess a happy birthday just before midnight Friday - alongside a reminder to send a belated birthday card to their father Thomas  August 4 marks Meghan\u0027s 37th birthday, the duchess\u0027s first as part of the Royal FamilyAround the time of Thomas Markle\u0027s 74th birthday, reports emerged that the reclusive former Hollywood lighting director hadn\u0027t spoken to his daughter in at least two months. Thomas has spoken about the estrangement in several interviews during that time, telling TMZ last month that he will continue talking to the media until he hears from Meghan. Meghan Markle\u0027s birthday wish every year is inspired by her...Prince Harry and Meghan Markle told friends \u0027if you talk to...Share this articleSamantha has been her father\u0027s most ardent defender amidst the media storm that has surrounded her half-sister\u0027s marriage to Prince Harry.

Robert E. Lee and a small obelisk marking a Reconstruction-era fight between city and state militia and a group called the White League.Research is being done to find out who might own the capsules, said Nungesser, who supported proposed state legislation to keep the monuments in New Orleans, and then a proposal to move the three statues to a suburban plantation.\u0027We will work with the city to find out what is proper,\u0027 Nungesser said.Two private conservators carefully removed each artifact or piece of an artifact.

After the earlier tariffs $34billion of US goods, about $120billion is available for retaliation.The highest penalties on the new list would be imposed on honey, vegetables, mushrooms and chemicals, targeting farming and mining areas that supported President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.The new list includes products as varied as snow blowers and 3D printers, suggesting Chinese authorities are struggling to find enough imports their own economy can do without.          White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a briefing Friday that \u0027instead of retaliating, China should address longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices\u0027Beijing\u0027s earlier round of tariffs appeared designed to minimize the impact on the Chinese economy by targeting soybeans, whiskey and other goods available from Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.Trump initially proposed 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200billion of Chinese imports, but he told trade officials this week to consider raising that to 25 percent. It will be September at the earliest before the U.S. decides whether to impose those tariffs.Chinese authorities warned earlier that if the dispute escalated, they would adopt unspecified \u0027comprehensive measures.\u0027 That prompted concern among American companies that retaliation might expand to disrupting their operations in China.The United States and China have the world\u0027s biggest trading relationship but official ties are increasingly strained over complaints that Beijing\u0027s technology development tactics hurt American companies.Trump\u0027s tariffs target goods the White House says benefit from industrial policies such as \u0027Made in China 2025\u0027, which calls for developing Chinese competitors in robotic, artificial intelligence and other fields.The dispute is part of broader US complaints about global trading conditions that have prompted Trump to raise duties on steel, aluminum, washing machines or solar panels from Canada, Europe, Japan and South Korea.A spokesman for China\u0027s foreign ministry appealed to Washington to negotiate but could not confirm reports the two sides were setting up talks.\u0027We urge the United States to come to its senses, correct its erroneous acts and create the necessary condition for a proper settlement as soon as possible,\u0027 spokesman Geng Shuang said.Trump campaigned on a promise to bring down America\u0027s massive trade deficits by renegotiating trade agreements and getting tough on countries like China that sell the U.S. far more than they buy from it.But the US Commerce Department reported Friday that the American trade deficit climbed to $46.3billion in June from $43.2billion in May. The deficit in goods trade with China also rose. So far this year, the trade gap is up more than seven percent from January-June 2017."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/03/22/052E5B24000003E8-6024615-image-a-4_1533331225611.jpg","title":"British dog owner applies Belgian citizenship PUG Pippa help travel Brexit","story":"    Pippa the pug is leading the pack for Brexit dogs abroad by getting Belgian citizenship so she can travel freely around Europe          The Pets Passport Scheme for international travel in Europe allows ferrets, cats and dogs who have been issued the document to travel to and from Britain           Pippa the pug\u0027s owner does not want to leave her in Brussels - preferring to bring her to Britain - where she enjoys the treatsOwner Nick Petre, 38, is forking €100 out for the Belgian pet passport – in a move which could well be replicated by frequent travellers.Pippa the pedigree pug and European Parliament employee Nick travel back to Britain and Ireland to see friends and family.But worried about their future travel together, Mr Petre set about finding a way to keep his dog by his side.Now, four-year-old Pippa has applied to become a citizen of Belgium in case Britain crashes out of the EU with no deal.Currently, around 250,000 pets travel from the UK to the EU every year.Under the EU\u0027s pet passport scheme three animals (cats, dogs and ferrets) can travel without being quarantined because they are cleared by a vet.Their little blue passport confirms they are in good health, have been vaccinated and can cross into Britain freely.But if Theresa May\u0027s Government fails to strike a deal with Brussels the passports may be rendered unusable.Paw\u0027s up, dude: Pups show off their skills and ride the...Australia\u0027s most popular dog breeds have been revealed – and...Pug life!

When the cost of a degree can be up to £60,000, can it ever make financial sense — especially when the great majority of students (nine out of ten, on some courses) will be unable to find a job that requires a university education?Changes have to be made, and now. Unless university places are restricted, our great institutions will be reduced to nurseries for over-qualified baristas, gym trainers and call centre workers.We can’t wait for the academics to come to their senses and start turning away undergraduates — their jobs depend on filling those places.Thankfully, the new Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, seems determined to do something about it. This week, he gave a speech in which he argued that more pupils should think about shunning university for alternatives, such as high-quality apprenticeships.He argued that youngsters, both working-class and middle-class, could benefit more from the Government’s new technical qualifications — known as ‘T-levels’ — which are being set up as an alternative to A-levels.Mr Hinds said: ‘We need to consider whether in all cases a traditional degree at university is the right option, including those from more affluent backgrounds.’What is remarkable is that it even needs to be said.The fact is that many graduates now see minimal or even negative returns from their degrees.Figures from the Office of National Statistics revealed recently that a third of graduates from some of the most popular degree courses in the country — including agriculture, psychology, English and creative design — are likely to be earning substantially less than the national average salary.And that’s true not just immediately after leaving university, but five years later.While the average UK salary is £27,600 a year, an ex-student with a degree in education, for example, is likely to be earning £23,700 — nearly £4,000 less.Yet every parent wants their child to go to university.That’s not an exaggeration: an Institute of Education study in 2010 found that 97 per cent of British mothers with children aged ten and under wished to see them go on to further education.          Universities are making thousands of unconditional offers - but this has been criticised as the higher education system swellsNo one is willing to recognise the blatant disadvantages of the failing system . . . and it’s hardly surprising. Too many people have too much at stake.There are more than 160 different universities and H.E. colleges in the UK today — many with multiple campuses — serving 2.32 million students, equivalent to the combined populations of Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham and Derby. They employ 400,000 people. Add those figures together, and they represent around 5 per cent of the UK’s entire population.Tony Blair’s New Labour government pledged to send half of all school leavers to university. But this bloat has its beginnings much earlier, in the Sixties. The post-war population boom and the success of the grammar schools were producing far more highly able candidates than universities could accommodate.A government report in 1963 recommended: ‘Courses should be available to all those who are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and who wish to do so.’The author, Lord Robbins, could not have imagined what his well-meaning proposal would set in motion.Today, more than 600,000 people apply for degrees every year. They surely cannot all be ‘qualified by ability and attainment’. The figures certainly suggest that they are not. In 2010, 51 per cent of university applicants had three grade Ds at A-level or worse. And there are places for them.Some establishments, mainly the newer ones, have been so desperate to fill up their courses that they have made huge numbers of unconditional offers to sixth-formers, which give prospective students guaranteed university places regardless of the outcome of their A-levels.Figures released last week by the Universities And Colleges Admissions Service show that universities made 67,915 unconditional offers this year — a staggering rise since the 2,985 given out in 2014.Schoolteachers have voiced concern that these unconditional offers are being dished out ‘like candy’.This removes the motivation to work, they say: ‘It affects performance,’ said one, who didn’t want to be named. ‘I would say that pupils with unconditional offers drop at least a grade.’Others regard it as a form of corruption: ‘That looks very much like bribery . . . “Come here, because you don’t need any grades.” ’The inevitable result is that, rather than attracting the finest young minds in the country, our universities are becoming breeding grounds for third-rate thought.Hundreds evacuated in central Virginia over fears dam could...Sleep really is the best medicine: How getting less than six...Has Malia Obama inherited her dad\u0027s weakness for nicotine?...Share this articleOnce, they produced young people with inquisitive, independent, open, questioning intellects.Now, the opposite is happening. The past decade has seen a worrying rise in the scale and intensity of self-censorship at universities, and an increasing demand for ‘safe spaces’ where students will be protected from any views that might disturb their intellectual, political and moral comfort zones.Students are imposing gender segregation, banning national newspapers, demanding the removal of statues they find offensive and, as occurred last month at Manchester University, defacing and painting out the text of the poem If by Nobel prize-winner Rudyard Kipling because the author was perceived as a racist.The famous verse was replaced with some lines by black American feminist Maya Angelou.Anything that could be construed as ‘cultural appropriation’ is stamped out, even down to the naming of foreign dishes in university canteens, and speakers as erse as Germaine Greer, Peter Tatchell and Nigel Farage have been denied a platform as a consequence of holding views deemed beyond the pale.In 2016, the magazine Spiked, which monitors censorship on campus, found that 90 per cent of British universities now place restrictions on freedom of expression.If that sounds unlike the heady, free-thinking days of yore, so is every other aspect of undergraduate life.With accommodation scarce and expensive, and the prospect of future unemployment ever more real, the student existence is no longer a three-year party. Instead, it can be expensive, difficult and isolating — causing a steep rise in mental illness, even suicide in the most tragic cases.Those who arrive with hopes of intense intellectual debate are quickly disillusioned: other students often lack interest and ability, and academics have no time to engage.In many departments, courses are so crowded that it is now the norm for each student to have just one face-to-face meeting with a tutor per term.There are also a large number of international students. It’s no surprise: — many universities are so eager to take students from abroad, and to charge them up to £100,000 in tuition fees over three years, that proficiency in English is no longer seen as necessary.One mature student told a House Of Commons Select Committee, as long ago as 2009: ‘The varying ability of the students and their poor English meant things had to be pitched to the lowest common denominator.‘One of my lecturers was being asked to slow his lectures down so that the significant number of Chinese students could follow what he was saying.‘His speed was fine for native speakers, so I would assume that any slowing down will have an impact on the material covered.’It all has an impact, of course. The inevitable result is that many graduates emerge with third-rate degrees in less than useful subjects from often third-rate institutions — and realise to their horror that what might be the most expensive purchase of their lives, apart from property (if they can ever buy a house), is worthless.Graduates with useless degrees are so numerous that one in ten childminders has a university education. So does one in six call centre staff, and one in four air cabin crew and theme park attendants.This can create bigger problems than mere frustration and bitterness. A former intensive care nurse, Rona Johnson, told the Mail in 2009: ‘Many graduate nurses feel they are too superior to clean floors and change beds.  Tony Blair’s New Labour government pledged to send half of all school leavers to university ‘Many less glamorous but vital elements of nursing have dropped off the syllabus, to be replaced with empty jargon about “holistic care” and “cultural sensitivities”.‘As a result, the incidence of lethal hospital infections is going through the roof.’The cost of all these useless degrees is almost beyond calculating. Each year students borrow over £12 billion. The total debt owed by UK graduates and undergrads is thought to be £100 billion.As a result, an entire generation will spend the first 30 years of their lives struggling with debts they cannot repay. The average debt of a British graduate is £50,000, the highest in the developed world.An income tax surcharge of up to nine per cent will be imposed on those who do manage to find well-paying jobs. This will prevent many from buying their own homes, getting married and starting families. Then, after 30 years, the remaining debt will be written off, at the cost of untold tens of billions to the taxpayer.All this financial grief is quite pointless. It is the mathematics of the madhouse.How do we end it? The most obvious first step is to gradually reduce the number of students — say, by five per cent per year for five years. This would reduce overcrowding on courses and increase the amount of contact between tutors and students.How can this be achieved? Well, for one thing, a minimum grade tariff should be set for access to student loans. Currently, a school leaver with just one grade E at A-level can claim a place at a new university — though they are likely to struggle academically, and quite probably drop out.Why should they automatically qualify for student finance when it’s so likely that the bill will eventually fall to the taxpayer?If an applicant cannot demonstrate a minimum level of attainment and ability, why should there be an automatic expectation of funding? It’s worse than ludicrous that a student capable of nothing better than one E-grade should be burdened with £50,000 — it’s cruel.(It also emerged this week that middle-class parents of students are being hit with a ‘stealth tax’ of up to £4,000 a year to pay for their child’s rent because rooms at some of the most popular universities cost far more than the maintenance loans available.)Of COURSE, low achievers with a genuine desire to better their education should not be denied the chance of tertiary education. Pupils can fail at school for all sorts of reasons, not all their own fault.          University graduates are not necessarily earning more than those who did not take degree courses, it has been foundThose with weak grades could be offered part-time education, initially with one credit for a module at the Open University. By passing that module, they could earn access to more funding, and so on.Student headcount could also be reduced by withdrawing or restricting funding for courses and universities with high drop-out rates and low levels of post-grad employment or earnings. At the very least, those courses should have to face a few pertinent questions.Do they offer the country some sort of benefit, perhaps improving our cultural life, that justifies the burden on taxpayers — ordinary working people whose hard-earned cash goes to pay for abandoned studies?Does the university make extra efforts to support mature students, who perhaps dropped out years or decades ago but who now want to tackle education in earnest?Does it have an especially good record with people from disadvantaged backgrounds, those with disabilities or from communities in the UK’s remoter areas?If the answer to all those is ‘No’, there’s an even more important question: why should we keep wasting public money? And there’s a simple answer: withdraw funding.Above all, Britain has to shake off the delusion that half our school leavers are better off going to university. It’s a monstrous con. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/03/18/4ECD6E2D00000578-0-image-m-13_1533315937182.jpg","title":"Do feel glum German health bosses play Brexit blues lure midwives come work them","story":"Health bosses in Germany are attempting to lure British midwives to work for them by asking them if they feel ‘glum’ about BrexitThe NHS can scarcely afford to lose more midwives, with English hospitals already 3,500 short of the 29,000 they need.The Commons Health Select Committee warned earlier this year that there have been more midwives leaving than joining the profession.Germany also has a shortage of midwives and the advert, placed on the Indeed.co.uk website, offers to help applicants find somewhere to live in Hanover and assistance settling in.It says British nurses should find it easy to work in the hospital, which follows similar guidelines to those of NHS watchdog Nice. ‘Our emphasis is on women-centred care, based largely on Nice guidelines, dating from our time as a designated hospital for UK service personnel,’ it says.Non, Madame!

The UK is more reliant on overseas doctors and nurses than almost any other health care system in the developed world, according to a report published by the NHS Providers organisation last year.

I just wish all British people had as much confidence in our great country’s future as those EU migrants who are going to remain after we leave.’But Jon Skewes, executive director of external relations at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘We can understand that British midwives may find this German offer very tempting.‘Nonetheless, we hope they choose to continue to work in the NHS at a time when it is already thousands of midwives short, at least in England.‘Many UK citizens feel very negative about being stripped of their EU citizenship, and will be considering their options before their ability to work elsewhere in Europe is made much harder.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/04/04/4ECE9B3A00000578-0-Louisiana_Lt_Gov_Billy_Nungesser_looks_over_artifacts_removed_fr-a-53_1533351909121.jpg","title":"Time capsule reveals cash flags more","story":"    This photo shows a 1913 time capsule before it was unpacked Friday, Aug. 3, 2018, at a Louisiana State Museum in New Orleans          Louisiana Lt.

Sun blazes out of a blank sky, heat beats “like a hammer on the pavement”, silencing the birds. A bookseller shuts up his shop and flees the city, but in his sunstruck confusion forgets a map. Lost, he comes upon a cool holloway, “a tunnel of green shade” that leads to “the edge of a dying lawn sloping slightly upward to a distant house … it seemed to me the most real and solid thing I’d ever seen, and yet at the same time a trick of my sight.” A child’s voice calls his name and he enters.The reader enters oddly familiar territory, too – territory that has seemed so ever since LP Hartley published The Go-Between in 1953. Hartley’s mesmerising novel about 12-year-old Leo, who finds himself, under slightly false pretences, in a grand house in Norfolk in a heatwave in 1900, was of course not the first to use summer as a framing device. There was Edith Wharton’s uneven but lingering 1917 novel Summer, for instance, and F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925) – but Hartley understood so well what summer allowed, it is sometimes hard not to see everything else in its light. “In the heat the senses, the mind, the heart, the body, all told a different tale,” as Leo puts it. “One felt another person, one was another person.” So too for the novelist, who is suddenly given the freedom to explore ideas and dilemmas that would have seemed implausible if the weather had stayed cool.At its most basic, this means a release from the usual constraints, although at the same time summer provides a usefully closed system. In The Cement Garden, Ian McEwan’s short fever-dream of a novel, 40 years old this year, a mother dies, orphaning her children, on the last day of term, stranding them in a summer that McEwan (who, as Alexandra Harris notes in Weatherland, has been explicit about The Go-Between’s influence on his work) points out contains “the hottest day since 1900”. But the reader knows, or at least guesses, that even though the children bury their mother in the basement, in concrete – even though all order breaks down and the kitchen, like their world, becomes “a place of stench and clouds of flies” – adult structure and authority, if only in the guise of school, must at some point reassert themselves. Colson Whitehead’s Sag Harbor (2009) begins on the first day of the summer holidays, as a family arrives on Long Island – and immediately posits an ending: “Ask, How long are you out for? … and all answers contemplated the end, the death of summer in its very beginning.” The reader knows that whatever “teenage entropy” ensues (for, as in The Cement Garden, Whitehead largely removes parents from the picture), some sort of order will eventually prevail. JL Carr called his brief, luminous, utterly original 1980 novel of a recently demobbed soldier finding peace and purpose in a Yorkshire belfry A Month in the Country. Carr played with his self-imposed constraints. Birkin, and another ex-soldier, Moon, are the classic strangers entering the closed system of a small village in summer at the same time, they make a working fraternity of two, which the villagers and a beautiful (married) woman interrupt.McEwan’s 2001 novel Atonement begins in a country house one hot day, when a misunderstanding by a child, Briony, of an adult sexual encounter (as in The Go-Between) changes the course of many lives. At one point Leon, Briony’s brother, observes “I love England in a heatwave. It’s a different country. All the rules change”, a deliberate allusion to Hartley’s opening line, one of the best-known of any English novel. Leon’s England is, as in Hartley’s novel, prewar upper-class England, when the rules were so much more evident, and the existential effect of their loosening so much greater. (The debt to Hartley was originally even clearer: in an early draft a novel by the adult Briony was rejected by Cyril Connolly, who noted: “I trust you’ve read The Go-Between.” McEwan was disappointed when he was told it was an anachronism and had to take it out.) Sag Harbor is similarly anchored and contained by a house in the Hamptons, a holiday home: important partly because it represents the hard work it took to afford it, and partly because, like almost every other house in Sag Harbor, it belongs to a black family. Although another summer house not far away, where memory is inextricable from lost happiness, turns out to be more important still.Taking characters to another (hot) country for a short space of time works, too: So Rachel Cusk, in Outline (2014), removes her protagonist to broiling Athens to teach a course Deborah Levy, in Hot Milk (2016), parks a mother and daughter in southern Spain in August. Constraint is useful for the basic plot reason that it can force unexpected people together summer adds heat to the pressure.Heat and long days do interesting things to time, and, however short and finite the season, it can give the impression both of being separate – “Summer is its own time”, as Whitehead puts it in Sag Harbor – and of going on for ever. “There was so much time that marvellous summer,” remembers Birkin in A Month in the Country. “Day after day, mist rose from the meadow as the sky lightened and the hedges, barns and woods took shape until, at last, the long curving back of the hills lifted away from the plain. It was a sort of stage-magic. … I had a feeling of immense content and, if I thought at all, it was that I’d like this to go on and on, no one going, no one coming, autumn and winter always loitering around the corner, summer’s ripeness lasting forever.” In The Cement Garden, there is too much time, terrible time, dripping and sweating and shapeless. In After Me Comes the Flood, the bookseller John Cole is repelled by the degree to which the adult inhabitants of the mysterious house drift through summer days, lost in games, making papier-mache heads, building a kind of curdled, dangerous child-world.Long time, and often deep time: Sag Harbor is, among other things, a bravura enactment of how the repetitiveness of summer – the arrival, the hope, the familiar porches and the corners of beach – both anchor a self and illuminate how it is changing how Benji and his friends (and his parents’ friends, and his grandparents’ friends) find themselves mingling “with who we had been, and who we would be”. Tove Jansson’s The Summer Book (1972), a small wonder of a novel, occurs over the warm months after a six-year-old’s mother has died, and which she, her father and her grandmother are spending on a small island in the Gulf of Finland. The father is largely absent, working, or planting misguided gardens, so the girl spends her time with her grandmother who, close to the end of her own life, is able to drift through the nightless days sharing the rhythm of a child’s vivid present. One summer, but also a lifetime of summers, memories growing out of each other, like the underbrush the two know so intimately the tree trunks, ferns and lichens and moss, layered and revealing glimpses of each other. Much of the power of the last third of To the Lighthouse, too, comes from Virginia Woolf setting one summer moment against another in the same place, but 10 devastating years later the attempt to repeatcomplete an innocent trip only underlining how impossible that is.Because things must change. In F Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, Jay Gatsby moves to West Egg and attempts, with his golden net of money, to recapture the summer when he and Daisy Buchanan fell in love in André Aciman’s Call Me by Your Name (2007), Oliver comes to stay with Elio’s family for a summer in the Italian Riviera, and Elio discovers a love against which all his later life will be measured. And in Hartley’s Norfolk, Leo loses his innocence. Early on he sees the elder daughter of the house, Marian, saying farewell to a man. But when Marian’s mother asks if they met anyone in town, Leo is so distracted by the pleasure of being chosen by Marian, who has just bought him beautiful clothes better suited to the heat than those he arrived in, he forgets and says no – thus committing his first act of complicity, and displaying his suitability as a go-between. For the next few weeks Leo enjoys the heat, is ecstatic with it, but becomes caught between Marian and her working-class lover, Ted, feeling but not always comprehending the degree to which his childhood is being stripped away.The moment Leo definitively grows up is the moment he learns what “spooning” is for Briony it is the day she thinks she sees her sister being attacked. The Cement Garden builds inexorably to a moment of transgressive sex – sex that might never have occurred if it wasn’t so hot, if the children weren’t so alone, if there were any boundaries operative at all. The discovery of sex isn’t always terrible, of course in Sag Harbor, for instance, Benji experiences his (classically underwhelming but nevertheless precious) first kiss. The summer fling is a cliche – elegantly mocked in, for example, Michael Frayn’s 2012 Greek island farce Skios – but that only underlines its ongoing power as an idea, which is of sudden possibility, of the promise of self-fulfilment and a kind of adult joy no less potent for probably being doomed. “If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures,” thinks Nick in The Great Gatsby, “then there was something gorgeous” about Gatsby, “some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life … he had an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.” The summer is an emblem of it.Summer is full of erotic charge. People wear fewer clothes, see more of each other. Things grow into ripeness, and more than ripeness, which is exciting but also threatening, overwhelming – a worry traced again and again through female sexuality. So the belladonna plant that plays a starring role in The Go-Between is a none-too-subtle metaphor in The Cement Garden a hormone-soaked teenage boy watches, fascinated and discomfited, as his sister flowers into adulthood. Charity Royall’s sexual awakening amid the proprieties of turn-of-the-last-century rural America is, in Summer, Edith Wharton’s central subject. In Salvage the Bones – Jesmyn Ward’s devastating 2011 novel set in the summer of 2005 in an isolated, rackety house in coastal Mississippi – sex is something 15-year-old narrator Esch takes almost for granted the discovery that she is pregnant, “womanly ripe”, however, changes the emotional landscape almost as much as Hurricane Katrina will alter its physical lines.In Hot Milk the young female protagonist visits her father and his new partner, then returns to the Spanish beach where she is suffering a doomed love for another woman. “I was flesh thirst desire dust blood lips cracking feet blistered knees skinned hips bruised, but I was so happy not to be napping on a sofa under a blanket with an older man by my side and a baby on my lap” – the latter a situation that in Wharton’s Summer seems the best possible outcome for a young woman in Charity’s position. And yet even this progress is not what it seems, because a central theme of Hot Milk, published more than a century later, is how much of the mother’s indefinable illness is a response to a marriage – traditionally the culmination of the season of love – in which she “could not find the words for how her own wishes for herself had been dispersed in the winds and storms of a world not arranged to her advantage”.It is not just women who find the world organised for someone else’s gain, however. Again and again summer is cast as a time when the icy ramparts of class might, just possibly, melt. The young man Wharton’s Charity meets is an urbane, book-writing architecture enthusiast from New York. Gatsby’s dubiously acquired money, spent on parties, a pool, a huge house, gives him the illusion for a few short weeks that he might claim to be Daisy Buchanan’s social equal. In Helen Cross’s My Summer of Love (2001), the father at the big house asks the working-class girl who mucks out his pony to make friends with his troubled daughter. In The Go-Between, Leo enables Ted and Marian to continue their trysts, and feels increasingly at home in a milieu far grander than his own. What is happening, he feels, is nothing less than a “struggle between order and lawlessness, between obedience to tradition and defiance of it, between social stability and revolution”.But even as these class-crossings seem possible, isions become apparent. Leo is troubled by small moments – his hostess noting how well his clothes are mended, or his friend mocking him for wearing his school hat in the country – that illuminate his social inferiority. Charity works in the village library but has no education when the young man from New York asks for advice, at once she sees the gulf between them, and while later she can briefly forget it, it is always there, getting deeper.Which is of course one sign of the irreversible process of growing up – a glimpse of one’s relation to the world and to other people. In Summer, the fourth volume in Karl Ove Knausgaard’s season-cycle, published in June, he remembers his youthful summers as being the worst time of year, because they were “accompanied by an expectation of pleasure and joy and groups of friends swimming or boating or on holiday and there I sat … while the sun was shining outside and I didn’t know where to go or what to do … it marked me, not just who I was in the eyes of others, but also who I was to myself.” Leo, while glorying in a kind of zenith of the self, becomes alienated in fundamental ways – yearning for a more glamorous life, troubled by the duplicities he is being required to enact, while only, like the child he is, wanting to please. Marian, “I dimly realised, was the rock on which I was split.”In the summer light things seem clearer, more vividly themselves than at any other time. Just before the harvest ends, Birkin is taken on a Sunday school picnic. “For me that will always be the summer day of summer days – a cloudless sky, ditches and roadside deep in grass, poppies, cuckoo pint, trees heavy with leaf, orchards bulging over hedge briars.” Charity goes on a buggy ride with the youth she now knows loves her too. “The haze of the morning had become a sort of clear tremour over everything, like the colourless vibration of a flame”: Wharton uses the word flame so often in this novel that it has to be deliberate: a flare of great heat and light containing in itself extinguishment and ashes.One great power of Hartley’s book is the contrast between Leo’s bright conviction that he is among the “inheritors of summer and the coming glory of the 20th century”, and the knowledge shared by the narrator (Leo in the 1950s) and the reader of just how terrible the first half of that century was going to be. In The Great Gatsby, the first world war is only just over, and any travel from East or West Egg to New York City requires one to pass the valley of ashes. A Month in the Country is set in 1920 Birkin somehow survived Passchendaele – the extreme shade a setting for his jewel of a Yorkshire summer, an unlooked-for gift given “on borrowed time”. Atonement begins in 1935, the second world war a coming darkness that gives extra brightness and fragility to the summer day. There is a whole subgenre of fictions set in the heatwave of 1976, when writers could use the ominous background of National Front marches, forest fires, a falling pound and the Notting Hill carnival riot: Maggie O’Farrell’s Instructions for a Heatwave, Alex Wheatle’s The Seven Sisters, Ruth RendellBarbara Vine’s A Fatal Inversion, Stephen Poliakoff’s play Strawberry Fields. And by simply mentioning the word Katrina, Ward invokes the ruin that will be visited on thousands of largely black, largely poor families like Esch’s their father tries to prepare for it, but he is chaotic and alcoholic, and for a long time his children, preoccupied with their own challenges, do not listen. The reader, however, knows what kind of storm is coming.So there is ripening, flowering, fecundity, but also, as the heat climbs, putrefaction, the unpredictable dog days, the invisible, gathering flood (Sarah Perry’s title is, as an engine of inevitable dread, extremely effective). The tension in The Go-Between comes less from the mechanical threat of the lovers’ being discovered than from a growing sense of moral tarnishment, a deflowering, the reader willing Leo to step back before it’s too late. The Great Gatsby, as with a whole later line of novels and short stories (by James Salter, John Updike, Fitzgerald’s own Tender Is the Night) set among privileged Americans, already contains its fallenness. The days and nights are beautiful, white sand and green grass and blue breakers, but full of alcohol and faithlessness Gatsby’s parties, all “whisperings and champagne and stars”, whirl around an empty core. “But it’s so hot!” wails Daisy Buchanan, late in the novel and on the verge of tears, looking out at Long Island Sound “stagnant in the heat”. “And everything is so confused. Let’s all go into town!” They end up in a New York City hotel room, drinking too much, the thin veneer of respectability cracking all about them. In The Cement Garden, the mother’s body releases a terrible smell and splits the cement open.Remarkably often in novels that take summer for their shape and impetus, a day of unbearable heat coincides with a major set piece (a cricket match, a concert, a harvest party, a homecoming festival, a firework display, a declaration of the heart) – and a storm. “During the night,” Birkin says, “the year had crossed into another season.” All too suddenly possibilities wither. The marriage survives, the upstarts are vanquished – they kill themselves, or sacrifice themselves to a loveless marriage, or are sent to war. Gatsby floats dead in his lovely pool, then is buried alone in the rain – punishment for the delusion that with his wild chutzpah he could bridge the ide between his beginnings and his dreams, could finally reach the little green light at the end of the dock. The upper classes close ranks. There’s a disappointing conservatism about it – where is the revolution so confidently promised? – or perhaps more accurately, a chilly realpolitik: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together.” Sag Harbor never even makes the pretence that racial isions might be healed: part of the preciousness of summer at this particular beach is that it is a breathing space a couple of months without the need to “know where the exits were in case something racial went down”.“A few days of autumn cold had wiped out all trace of the rich fields and languid groves,” writes Wharton. “She could no longer believe that she was the being who had lived them she was someone to whom something irreparable and overwhelming had happened, but the traces of the steps leading up to it had almost vanished.” Over and over again one summer becomes the hinge, often but not always the high point, of an entire life.The question then is how to look back on it: as tragedy and the cancellation of a life’s promise (The Go-Between)? As a mistake for which to make decades of reparations (Atonement)? As unavoidable as growing up, and thus an everyday grief (Sag Harbor)? Or perhaps just sometimes, it is possible to attain a different kind of realism, to celebrate, as Elio’s father tells him in Call Me by Your Name, a brief time where hope and life and love were, against all odds, at one. “Remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. Most of us can’t help but live as if we have two lives … one a mockup, the other the finished version … but there’s only one and before you know it your heart is worn out.” Grasp the moment, even though you know it will pass. “Ah those days,” writes Carr in A Month in the Country, which is that extraordinary thing, a novel that manages to bring alive, without sentimentality, a rare, unlooked-for few weeks of gentle happiness. “Sometimes, listening to music, I drift back and nothing has changed. The long end of summer. Day after day of warm weather, voices calling as night came on and lighted windows pricked the darkness and, at day-break, the murmur of corn and the warm smell of fields ripe for harvest. And being young”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ed15676891144e5485f5d6de6eadf84e0b2ff9/0_225_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b50e633b3c2c2af81c1990ad365d40e","title":"bangkok street vendor ban prompts outcry thailand","story":"Tourists and stallholders say city’s attempt to sanitise the bustling, chaotic Khaosan Road is stripping the area of its charmFew streets evoke the chaos of Bangkok like the Khaosan Road, a place of pilgrimage for tanned, dreadlocked, tassle-adorned backpackers for decades.Yet this week, in an attempt to impose some order on the capital’s famed tourist road, the Thai authorities ordered all street vendors selling food, clothes and trinkets to clear off the pavements during the day.The edict caused an outcry from locals and tourists alike. The Bangkok politan Administration (BMA), a form of city police, has been accused of trying to sanitise the atmosphere that makes this stretch such a draw for millions each year – and at the expense of the street’s 200 vendors, who already have meagre earnings.“It’s such a shame, it’s a shocking idea,” said Taisha Thompson, who was visiting from Sydney. “We came here this time last year and the street was full of food and it was amazing, it was a beautiful atmosphere. I was wondering what had happened, the atmosphere is entirely different now. They are wrong if they think this is what visitors want.”Sitting surrounded by beads, gold buddhas, elephant-embroidered trousers and an assortment of coloured, dreadlocked hair extensions, one shop owner who has had a business on the Khaosan Road for more than 20 years was downbeat. On a Thursday afternoon, the day after the clearance, the road was unusually deserted.Gone were the stalls, and with them the tourists who would usually be purchasing mango smoothies, pad thai and cheap sunglasses. She declined to give her name for fear of angering the authorities. “Yes, it’s been quiet since the street vendors were cleared,” she said. “The street is now orderly but I think it’s lost the charm. As you can see it now looks quite ordinary, like any other street in the world. The BMA’s controversial edict keeps Khaosan Road empty in the daytime – in stark contrast to the surrounding streets, which have vendors every few metres – and restrict all street sellers to the evenings. After 6pm, stalls are allowed to set up in the road in strictly allotted slots. A similar approach was taken in neighbouring Singapore, where street life exists only in highly regimented spaces. Yet, as most vendors have pointed out, most people trawling the Khaosan Road at night are not looking to shop but to taste the street’s notorious nightlife. They argue the plan takes the life out of the street during the day, and have petitioned the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, to intervene.“Independent stalls helped develop this street over the last 30 years until it became an important Bangkok landmark,” said Yada Pornpetrumpa, the president of the Khaosan Road street vendor association. “Now, the government won’t even listen to us.”In order to get around the new law, Phai had set up his stall in a cramped alcove, but business was much poorer than usual – he had only sold two dreamcatchers that day to passing tourists, rather than the usual dozen. It was a similar story for fruit juice seller Dao, who had been forced to move to a small hole in the wall instead of her usual pavement spot. She had made just 500 baht (£11), a fraction of her usual takings, because tourists had been driven elsewhere for their shopping and eating.“We were here two weeks ago and there was so much more going on,” said Alice Preece, 22, from Yorkshire. “We had to walk down the road with our rucksacks on and it was a nightmare trying to get around all the street vendors, so it’s nice to have a bit of space but it’s taken the buzz away. That chaos is what makes Bangkok Bangkok. It’s messy and mad – they shouldn’t try to clean that away.”It is not the first time Thailand’s military government has tried to impose order in Bangkok’s tourist hotspots. In January last year, Sukhumvit, a district popular with expats, was cleared of its street vendors. Stalls selling everything from shoe-fixing services and fried chicken to fish balls, somtam (papaya salad) and fresh fruit, disappeared from the busy pavements, again prompting complaints that the soul of the city was being sanitised.The Sukhumvit clearance has not been entirely successful, however. Many stallholders remain, using moveable carts that can be quickly picked up if authorities approach. Most vendors on the Khaosan Road remain hopeful that the BMA will abandon its unpopular rule.Vikram Bahardu, who usually sells clothing, said the row was now about money and saving face. Negotiations have taken place between the BMA and traders about a possible levy on daytime carts, rather than kicking them off altogether. “They used to charge us 500 baht per month, now they are talking about charging 1,000 baht, maybe 2,000 baht, to let us sell on the streets in the daytime,” said Bahardu. “All I want is not to lose my stall.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89370be708ba4bb8dac3906f011ab516b4ddc0d0/0_66_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7de8699b78fa38264436ad546a6c50c4","title":"frank field labour mp brexit birkenhead","story":"To follow the career and pronouncements of Frank Field is to guarantee a lifetime of banging your head against the nearest table in abject misery.

Every last one of them, apparently, yelling, “The only Brexit is hard Brexit” as they left the polling station.Now Field has been subject to a vote of no confidence by his constituency Labour members, it’s about time his obsessions – with immigration, with working-class respectability, and with meting out punishment to those on the margins of society – were held up to greater scrutiny. He has made a name for himself as an “independent thinker”, when the reality is his views and his party membership are essentially incompatible.I’m hesitant about mandatory reselection of MPs, given that every time the party’s pendulum swings from left to right and back, everyone who doesn’t slot in neatly will be more likely to be slung out. But Field’s views are so clearly inimical to Labour principles of justice, humanity and acceptance that in his case it’s reasonable to ask whether he should still be representing Labour voters in parliament.Since the Blair era, Labour has suffered a lack of confidence in applying those principles, adhering rigidly to the belief that voters in working-class constituencies are socially conservative with authoritarian leanings, and preferring to tack to the right than to offer genuine alternatives.Field does not lack confidence: he really does think there’s no alternative. He has campaigned to have constituents who engage in antisocial behaviour housed in metal containers under the M53 motorway. He has complained that “We still haven’t really taken the gloves off” to confront “neighbours from hell” and frequently makes distinctions in his own constituency between “toerags” and “decent hardworking taxpayers”, with only the latter deserving fair treatment.This is in the context of Birkenhead – a Merseyside town that has lost nearly half of its population since the 1950s, and was recently classed as the fourth-worst place to earn a living in the UK in part because of low earnings and business closures. The idea that Birkenhead might be shorter than other places on “decent hardworking taxpayers” might have something to do with there not being enough jobs to work hard at and pay tax.For a long time it was possible to see Field’s authoritarian worldview as part of a left-right continuum in Labour’s internal politics, with Field representing a strongly held “traditional” view of, for instance, working-class family and neighbourhood life (which wasn’t so much traditional as imposed by prevailing middle-class norms and, in any case, virtually impossible to achieve in conditions of extreme poverty).When New Labour entered power in 1997, he was tasked with “thinking the unthinkable” on welfare reform because he had, according to his own website, “led the campaign to make the Labour party electable” after 1979. As well as that self-styled “campaign”, before entering parliament he headed the Child Poverty Action Group and the Low Pay Unit in the 1970s, during which time he developed a specific and obsessive image of who “real” working-class people were – revealing, by definition, who are not.For Field, the line between respectability and its lack, and deserving and undeserving, is sacrosanct. The emphasis in his many statements on working-class respectability always comes down to self-reliance and mutual interdependence within strict local boundaries. He views the universal benefits offered by the postwar welfare state as having corrupted this ideal by offering assistance as a right rather than a conditional reward. Immigration he views solely through the prism of its perceived effects on “the white working class”.As with many other Labour MPs who frame their obsession with immigration as simply representing the views of “real working-class people”, he happens to represent a constituency with little recent immigration (although, of course, it was built on generations of inward migration from Ireland). No matter what Field suggests, EU membership has not driven down living standards and pay rates in places such as Birkenhead, which is in the state it’s in because of actions taken – and not taken – by British governments, the current one of which he seems determined to support.His supporters in Merseyside and beyond will point to his tireless opposition to universal credit and the fact that, in places where the scheme was piloted (Birkenhead included), its introduction has made people destitute. He has set up the Feeding Britain charity with fellow Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck to ensure children in constituencies such as theirs are fed all year round. Yet he campaigns against child poverty and family suffering while, with his other hand, brandishing a stick to anyone who, in his view, doesn’t come up to scratch.That puts him not on the “sane left”, as I suspect he would put it, but on the hard right. Labour is within reach of winning an election not by pandering to social conservatism but by pointing out, calmly and optimistically, that we are not living in the past. Even Field himself thought, “God, what am I doing in this party?” in 2015, when he couldn’t get Ed Miliband to agree with him on immigration.

Will they stay off their phones and, specifically, off Twitter and Facebook?I’m filled with admiration for the pal who stayed off the tweets a full month, only now gradually re-entering that realm, blinking into the darkness. That took some serious willpower. How funny to think that we once regarded the humble email device as addictive – the CrackBerry, we called it – when, in fact, those machines exerted a tiny pull next to the iron grip of social media on a smartphone. The BlackBerry was a post-dinner cigarette compared to the full smack habit that is hand-held Twitter.How compulsive is it? Let me take you to a golden summer’s evening in Hyde Park, for last month’s farewell concert by Paul Simon. Most of the crowd were rapt, absorbing this swansong by a musical legend. But in front of me was a woman who, clearly enough of a Simon enthusiast to have bought an expensive ticket, nevertheless pulled out her phone every 20 or 30 seconds. Four or five times during each song. She was not using it to take photos of the performance. (I was close enough, and distracted enough, to see.) She was, instead, scrolling through social media updates, thumbing her way through observations about the news – including factoids about France’s World Cup victory that afternoon. Even when Simon closed with The Sound of Silence – a transcendent, transporting moment – she couldn’t help it: she reached for the phone. She needed one more fix.Where there is anecdote, there is also data. On Thursday Ofcom reported that the average Briton checks their smartphone every 12 minutes – which obviously means plenty are checking it much more often than that. Britons are spending an average of 24 hours online each week, with one in four clocking up 40 hours.There are obvious reasons why this might be bad, reasons of both time and space. The time suckage is striking. I know myself how quickly an hour or more can disappear down a Twitter rabbit hole. (I’ve never really done Facebook, but I confess to a Twitter problem: I still like the speed, range of stories and expertise I’d otherwise miss.) Think of all the conversations you could have had, the books you could have read, when instead you were going deep into some thread you’ll have forgotten seconds later. I recall the cartoon of the man who won’t go to bed, even when summoned by his partner. “I can’t, this is important,” he explains. What is it? “Someone is wrong on the internet.” But it’s also the view out of the train window that you never saw, because your head was down, staring at that glowing screen.Still, that, frankly, is the least of the harm. The real problem is that “addiction makes people crazy”, to quote internet pioneer Jaron Lanier, author of a polemic published this summer: Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now.Just look at how people who are otherwise sane and courteous behave online: the arguments, the sarcasm, the aggression, the abuse. Of course human beings have always been capable of fighting, but something strange happens on social media. For one thing, confrontation on the screen happens more often than it ever would in our daily lives. Put a device in people’s hands, and suddenly they’re on a hair-trigger – either giving or taking offence.One crucial factor is social media’s ability to stage a confrontation in public. Suddenly two iniduals will be slugging it out in front of everyone else. If they’re famous, someone will post a gif of Michael Jackson munching popcorn. This has no counterpart in real, or pre-Twitter, life. In the past, TV might have hosted a bust-up between two antagonists. But the spontaneous, genuine row unfolding in real-time in front of a mass audience: that’s new.And those exchanges often descend into the toxic. The instant they shift to Direct Message mode – without an audience – they become calmer and more considered, freer of performance and posturing. But on the platform, in public view, Lanier is right: even good people rapidly become “assholes”. If they have something else at stake – for example, their career prospects when they post on LinkedIn – they tend to behave better, he says. But when it’s just sounding off about politics, broadly defined, the asshole within reigns supreme.Part of the problem is the lack of context. On social media, people too often approach a statement as if it is the very first that person has made (unless, of course, they want to expose the tweeter as a hypocrite, by revealing the contradiction with thoughts posted earlier). Sometimes the results are comic – when a bloke in the pub is telling a nuclear weapons engineer how nukes work – but more often it’s just infuriating. So you’re denounced for “failing to address” x, when you have, in fact, been addressing x for years and, indeed, addressed it in a tweet posted a matter of minutes earlier. It’s partly this lack of context that explains the aggressive atmosphere. Those we know well need do little to gain our attention those we don’t have to shout and scream and swear to get noticed.And all this is before you get to the proven, documented abuse and manipulation of these platforms by people who mean us harm, as revealed by my Observer colleague Carole Cadwalladr in her exposés of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: witness the Russia-backed content that reached 126 million Americans via Facebook during the 2016 presidential election.But the truth is, the problem lies not with abuse of the medium, but with the medium itself. Addiction was built into social media’s design from the start – recall former Facebook president Sean Parker describing the “little dopamine hit” the product gives users to keep them hooked – and so too was the anger. The feedback algorithm rewards “engagement”, and a swift, vicious denunciation registers as engagement of a particularly intense kind. Lanier notes that an unintended consequence of Black Lives Matter was that, thanks to the algorithm, it connected its fiercest opponents with each other online, fuelling and cohering the resurgent white supremacist movement we see today.Philosophically, the right people to blame for these products are their producers, not their consumers – just as we ought to blame junk food manufacturers for obesity, rather than railing against iniduals for insufficient willpower. That makes moral sense and we should push the tech giants to change.And yet, for some of us, that change will not come quickly enough. Deleting our accounts – total abstinence – might feel like too great a leap, but an August holiday presents an opportunity, if not to delete then at least to detox. So when the time comes to pack my bags later this month, I’ll be taking sunscreen, a few novels, but no Twitter. I’ll listen instead to the sound of silence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/097afc740489358bbc3ccd1b8be4c41a5826af5f/0_139_4181_2508/master/4181.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c713faa717b135e83ab138cb2638fe65","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A quarter of a million roosting gannets in Yorkshire, an orca whale mother keeps her dead calf afloat and Norwegian reindeer seek cool in busy road tunnels – it’s the week in wildlife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908e7b2fc05518507013d7397182d7e10be4777e/0_84_2816_1690/master/2816.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e979b97b73ecbe26a2b105a0cf2c4f63","title":"michael lehmann on the legacy of heathers cult teen film","story":"While some of the taboo-busting elements of the Winona Ryder-starring film have not aged well, much of its toxicity still resonates Any doubts about whether Heathers still appeals to people 30 years after its release were answered by a recent trip to Heathers: The Musical. I’m old enough to remember seeing Heathers in the cinema in 1989, but looking around the auditorium, my generation was easily in the minority. It was overwhelmingly young adults and teenagers, mostly female, many of them dressed in full Heather regalia: shoulder-padded blazers, knee-high socks, tartan, primary colours and, of course, scrunchies. The movie’s pitch-black comedy has been brightened somewhat on its journey to the 21st-century stage, with the addition of musical numbers such as Freeze Your Brain (on the transformative properties of 711 slushies) and My Dead Gay Son (in which a double funeral becomes an anthem to inclusivity). The show, which transfers to the West End in September, was raucously received. As a Heather would say, it was very.Clearly, one reason Heathers endures is its compendium of high-1980s style tips. Another is its arsenal of eminently quotable lines (“Well fuck me gently with a chainsaw”, “What is your damage, Heather?” “Did you have a brain tumour for breakfast?”). But, like all good cult movies, Heathers went further than was generally considered acceptable, and in doing so it captured what other movies of its era missed. This was the era of Reagan’s “Morning in America”: a facade of cheery, 1950s-style conservatism veiling “greed is good” capitalist ruthlessness. It was also a time when the Brat Pack and John Hughes movies such as The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink ruled the teen roost. Hughes could go deep but he rarely went dark. Heathers, on the other hand, is a black comedy about America’s black soul.“We didn’t think things were as fun as everybody else did,” says Heathers’ director, Michael Lehmann. Lehmann is as surprised as anyone to still be talking about Heathers. It was his first movie, working to a script by another first-timer, Daniel Waters. “We were looking at the John Hughes films and saying ‘This is bullshit!’ The movies are fun, we like them, but we didn’t think they really represented the truly cruel nature of interpersonal behaviour in high school.”For the uninitiated, Heathers is the tale of teenage Veronica (played in the movie by Winona Ryder), who is caught between the clique of vicious, immaculately attired in-girls (all named Heather), and the charming outsider rebel, JD (Christian Slater), who really wants to kill everybody – and partially succeeds, with Veronica’s help. Heathers touched on, and laughed at, suicide, self-harm, eating disorders, school shootings, peer group pressure, fat-shaming and even rape. It is high school red in tooth and claw, and scrunchie.“People look at the movie now and go, ‘Wow. Did people really dress like that?’ We were saying the same thing at the time!” says Lehmann. As with its fashion sense, Heathers exaggerated what was already there. “One of the reasons the movie still has an afterlife is it’s such a perverse vision of what people looked like and acted like at the time. And it’s not that far from the way things really were but stylised enough to make it clear that we were doing satire, you know?”Needless to say, not everybody in 1980s America saw the funny side. Heathers was not a box-office hit. “People were outraged: ‘How dare you make a comedy about teenage suicide?’ Well I didn’t make a comedy about teenage suicide,” says Lehmann (nobody in Heathers actually commits suicide). “There were plenty of people at the time who thought the humour was irresponsible, and that the choice of subject was not something that should be put up for satire and, you know, I just rolled my eyes and said the most horrific topics should be the ones that are best suited to satire.”Not all of Heathers’ taboo-busting has aged well, Lehmann admits. The idea of shooting a couple of jocks then making it look like a gay suicide pact (hence the father’s declaration: “I love my dead gay son!”) would not really wash today. Nor would the image of a trench-coated teen casually waving around a gun in the cafeteria. This was 10 years before the Columbine massacre, when jokes about school shootings were still in the realms of far-fetched fantasy.The movie is also somewhat blithe when it comes to matters of sexual assault. Three characters try to rape Veronica over the course of the movie. There is also an uncomfortable scene where the two jocks take Veronica and weak-willed Heather McNamara (played by Lisanne Falk) on a disastrous double date involving cow-tipping in a field. While Slater turns up to rescue Veronica, and while they converse in the foreground, Heather McNamara is being sexually molested in the background.Lisanne Falk winces when she looks back on that scene, she says: “I thought we were doing this funny scene in the background. I’m not going to call myself stupid but I want to say ‘naive’. I didn’t over-think it, but I look at it now and think: ‘I guess that was pretty horrible.’” Many teenage actors, including Heather Graham and Jennifer Connelly, turned down roles in Heathers, or rather, their parents didn’t let them do it. Falk now has a 14-year-old daughter of her own. Having held out for as long as possible, they sat down to watch Heathers a couple of weeks ago “because all her friends had seen it”. Her daughter’s reaction? “She was really weirded out seeing her mother on screen, of course,” says Falk, “but she just laughed like, ‘Oh my god, these people still exist!’ I guess they will always exist, and that’s the thing we talked about afterwards, being able to find your own identity when you have all these people trying to figure out who they are but then end up following what they think is popular. She tells me when they have non-uniform days at school – it’s a girls’ school – all the girls come in and they’re wearing the same outfits. It’s that thing where you think you’re being different but you’re all being the same because it’s safer.”As well as capturing its time, Heathers caught something universal, then, but bringing it into the modern day has required some adjustments. Heathers: The Musical is a brighter, more optimistic proposition than the movie, with more of a female self-empowerment theme and less in the way of transgressive satire. The sexual assault incidents have been removed, fewer guns are waved around, Veronica no longer burns her hand with a cigarette in self-loathing. It hits the spot with fans, but others have likened it to “a mere Glee episode about suicide”.The musical is not the only recent repackaging of Heathers there is also Heathers the TV series. Set in the present day, it is billed as “a satirical comedy that takes creative risks in dealing with many of society’s most challenging subjects, ranging from personal identity to race and socio-economic status to gun violence”. The show makes some drastic changes to the original set-up: the new Heathers of the piece are no longer all thin, privileged white girls instead, one is a plus-sized girl, one is a black lesbian, and one is a genderqueer male (Veronica is white and blonde). Thus, the original film’s political satire is turned on its head. It was applauded by far-right commentators, which was probably not the intention. As one review put it: “If you believe that kids these days are fragile ‘snowflakes’, that political correctness is running amok, and that LGBT people are now society’s true bullies, this new Heathers is the show for you.”The series was scheduled to air this March but was postponed at the last minute in light of the high-school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Three months later, after the Santa Fe school shooting, the show was pulled from US schedules altogether. “The combination of a high school show with these very dark moments didn’t feel right,” said the studio, although it has been made available, without fanfare, in some European and African countries – where presumably the far-right vibes play better. A sequel to Heathers the movie was also talked about for many years, says Michael Lehmann. Winona Ryder was especially keen. “Her idea was that the Heathers had all gone to work in Washington DC.” In its absence, some of that Heathers legacy has percolated down through the generations, in teen movies such as Clueless, Mean Girls and Election, or this year’s Thoroughbreds, about two privileged white girls who coolly plot a murder.Now Lehmann wonders if we’re not actually living in a Heathers sequel: “I watch the American political news and I can’t believe how much it’s like high school! I watch Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders: they are Heathers – absolutely flat out. Ivanka is certainly a Heather, and Donald Trump himself is like a big Heather!” There’s something about the Trump establishment’s combination of pitiless, cliquey belligerence and presentational power-dressing that suggests teenage girls aren’t the only ones who’ve been using Heathers as a style manual. In an irony Veronica would surely appreciate, the jocks and the bullies and the mean girls triumphed after all. That’s not to suggest someone needs to blow up the White House and make it look like a mass suicide, but it’s certainly fuel for some kind of rebellion.The 30th anniversary re-release of Heathers is out in cinemas on Friday 10 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1129ee104cf861a43dbf99514502dbc0a853a34/1072_350_2716_1630/master/2716.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87affb06557f2745f2946111c0f8870f","title":"mum youtube bollywood star mawaan shahnaz rizwan","story":"When the comedian Mawaan Rizwan put his mother Shahnaz into his videos, they were an instant hit. And then Bollywood came calling...In 2012, the comedian Mawaan Rizwan was making videos for YouTube and gaining modest success. One day, he found himself in need of a stooge for his latest sketch, so he roped in his mum, Shahnaz.The resulting video, My Mum Hates Me, in which the two of them banter back and forth about all the ways in which they annoy each other, took off in a way he’d never experienced. “That got 115,078 views,” he says. “So we did loads more sketches. In one of them, she dressed up as a goth, in another she was a midwife.”His mother proved to be Mawaan’s secret weapon: in his first year on YouTube, working alone, he had managed a million views in total by 2013, with his mother alongside him, he was getting 6.1m.Then, almost exactly a year after he’d first put Shahnaz in front of the camera, Bollywood came calling. Mawaan was thrilled still in his early 20s, he was convinced his big break had arrived. “I thought, ‘Here we go! Fame is around the corner. When do you want to meet me? And they said, ‘Oh, it’s not you we want. The person we’re interested in casting is your mother.’”“I thought, ‘There’s no way mum will be interested in a career in Bollywood.’ But when I mentioned it to her she said, ‘Why not?’”Five years on, Shahnaz is one of the most recognised faces in Asia after starring in a TV series called Yeh Hai Mohabbatein (This Is Love), one of India’s top five TV shows. Mawaan, meanwhile, still a struggling standup, has incorporated the story of how he accidentally made his mother a Bollywood superstar into the show he’s taking to this year’s Edinburgh festival.Mother and son are fast-talking live wires – colourful, engaging and funny. But it’s very clear that Shahnaz is centre stage, and Mawaan waits for his cues with charm and obvious pride in his mother’s achievements. Those achievements, it transpires, are as much off-screen as on: in 1994, when Mawaan was two and his older sister was four, Shahnaz realised they were never going to get the sort of education she wanted for them in Pakistan, so she brought them to Britain. “I knew no one,” she says. “Had no contacts, no money, and my husband said he didn’t have the courage to come. But I knew I had to do it.”When her husband followed them to the UK, Shahnaz had another son and turned her single-minded approach to raising the family. “If we needed help, my mum would teach herself, whatever the subject was, so she could tutor us,” Mawaan says. “Then she started tutoring other kids to make some money. We had to study at home for at least two hours a day. Home was more school-like than school: there were colour-coded timetables on the walls and our main furniture was books. I went to school for a rest.”But as well as Shahnaz’s energy – she was holding down two or three jobs at a time – Mawaan was aware of her dramatic potential, because his mother had form: her father had been an actor and director and, aged three, she had made her film debut. She had gone on to appear in 35 black-and-white Pakistani films – always playing a boy.She gave up when she hit her teens because her family didn’t approve of acting as a career. She’d never expected to do it again, but was excited by the YouTube opportunity offered by her son, and wanted to experiment.“She had always been very strict and focused on our schoolwork, but when she acted in my videos, I saw her in a new light,” Mawaan says. “Playful and fun in a different way. She started to open up. It changed our relationship – it was good for us.”But there were two tough conversations ahead. First, Mawaan’s education. “I loved making those videos I loved doing standup. I knew it was my future, so I had to tell her that I wanted to stop studying – I didn’t want to go to university. And that was hard for her to hear.”“It was a big shock, a terrible shock, very disappointing,” Shahnaz says now. “I’d sacrificed so much for Mawaan’s education, and here he was saying he was giving it all up.”The second difficult conversation took place during one of Mawaan’s videos – but it was so exposing, he says, that he never posted it. “Somehow the topic of homosexuality came up, and my mum said something I disagreed with. And I said to her, ‘What would you say if one of your children was gay?’ My mum came from a different world – it was something she’d never considered.”Eventually, Mawaan told his mother everything. “I told her I was gay, that I’d done drugs and had a nipple pierced. And I said: ‘I’ve also tried bacon.’” For Shahnaz, that was the final straw. “I cried about the bacon,” she says. “I’m very religious. The truth was that I had an idea of what he would become, and he turned out to be something else. That’s what parents have to learn to cope with.”When Shahnaz embraced Bollywood, she gave her son the space he needed. She headed to Mumbai and signed a TV contract, working in India for five years. But living away from her family took its toll, and she recently left the show in order to return to the UK.Mawaan remembers being worried for his mother when she originally left, but when he visited her and they both went to India’s version of the Baftas, buzzing with famous actors and producers, he could see she was perfectly at home.Soon, she was being recognised on her trips back to the UK. “If we go somewhere like Tooting or Southall, she’s mobbed,” Mawaan says. “And the neighbours were like, ‘Isn’t that lady from No 62 the big star on the telly?’”There has been a downside: without his mother, Mawaan’s YouTube views have declined. But Shahnaz has given him so much more than material. “The truth is, my mum is an unstoppable force. She’s subverted every expectation her family had of her as a child growing up in Pakistan – she’s broken every convention, defied every rule, and she’s taught me that same spirit. Because of her, I’m aiming for the top.• Mawaan Rizwan is performing Juice at the Edinburgh festival fringe 1-12 and 14-27 August tickets frompleasanceeventmawaan-rizwan-juice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d73ba57983b66d538b59991d96ffee4607a07bc/116_0_2572_1544/master/2572.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0119bec8ed201272201948010be89a1a","title":"leeds united marcelo bielsa","story":"The legendary manager has implemented bold changes at the Championship club since his arrival in EnglandMarcelo Bielsa had a question. The new Leeds manager wanted to find out how hard the average supporter had to work to pay for a ticket to watch the team. How many hours did he or she have to put in? It was unclear what kind of calculations went into the answer but one was provided. It would be about three.So the Argentinian called his players together and he told them that, for the next three hours, they would be picking up litter from around the club’s Thorp Arch training ground. He wanted them to learn a lesson to appreciate how the fans laboured to fulfil their passion.It was classic Bielsa on many levels, taking in his empathy for the worker, his fixation with discipline and team spirit and, above all, the quirkiness and unpredictability that has led to the “El Loco” nickname. The 63-year-old is not crazy. It is just that his obsessive nature, ferocious intensity, eccentricities and refusal to adhere to convention can make him seem that way.When Bielsa strode into Leeds on 15 June to replace Paul Heckingbottom, it quickly became clear the club would never be the same again. The stories of Bielsa’s attention to detail are already legendary. He runs his forefinger across various surfaces at Thorp Arch to check for dust, invariably being appalled at what he finds, while he once inquired why there was a bootprint on a wall – about half a yard from the floor.It was explained to him that, perhaps, it was the result of somebody leaning back against it, with his or her foot up. “That shows the person is not concentrated on their work! Unacceptable!” Bielsa exclaimed. Leeds have had and do have bigger problems than the odd dirty mark but this is Bielsa, the perfectionist, and this is how he intends to drag the club up by their bootlaces: little bit by little bit.Leeds are often described as the deepest sleeping of England’s giants and their travails since relegation from the Premier League in 2004 are well-documented. The club have tried many things and gone through many managers yet the roll of the dice on Bielsa is arguably the most intriguing and exciting.This, after all, is a former Argentina manager a man who became a hero in Chile for his work with the national team and somebody so revered at Newell’s Old Boys, his local club in Rosario and the first one he managed, 28 years ago, that they have named the stadium after him.Bielsa has also taken charge of clubs in Mexico, Spain, France and Italy – although only briefly in the last of these. He walked out on Lazio after two days in 2016 because, to his mind, things were not right and he could feel it straight away. The drama somehow added a further layer to his maverick legend. The year before, he quit Marseille after the first game of his second season.Bielsa is a mentor to some of the game’s leading managers, chiefly Pep Guardiola, Diego Simeone and Mauricio Pochettino, whom he took to Newell’s as a promising 14‑year‑old defender and set on the path to an international career.It was the idea of Victor Orta, the Leeds director of football, to consider Bielsa, and Andrea Radrizzani, the club’s owner, saw the merit in it the intrinsic sense of boldness. Bielsa’s CV spoke for itself, as did his commitment to attacking football. He was also available, his previous job at Lille having ended quickly and badly in December 2017.Bielsa was the No 1 candidate. After what amounted to a job interview in Buenos Aires with the managing director, Angus Kinnear, and Orta, he became the only candidate. Kinnear and Orta had wanted to know how well he knew the Championship. Bielsa delved into his copious notes and began his response by detailing the respective teams in formation from last season’s Burton v Bolton game.Then, he went through every formation Burton and Bolton had used throughout the season and, after that, he did likewise for every other club in the ision. Bielsa could say, for example, how many times a team had played 4-3-3, 4-4-2 or 3-5-2. He had even calculated the probability for one formation to beat another. The story of how Kinnear and Orta reacted has gone around Elland Road. They are said to have looked at each other, shrugged and agreed it was a pretty good answer.Leeds had a final obstacle to clear regarding a work permit because Bielsa had not worked often enough over the past few years. He needed to go down the FA’s exceptional talent route but he would receive exceptional backing, with Pochettino – following a request from Leeds to Tottenham – only too happy to write a letter of support.Bielsa went before the FA’s expert panellists – the Portsmouth manager, Kenny Jackett, and the former Blackburn and England winger Stuart Ripley – and it is fair to say the outcome was not in doubt. Unlike Bielsa, neither Jackett nor Ripley has managed at a World Cup. Bielsa has brought eight members of staff with him to Elland Road and the club are paying them a collective £3m a year after tax.Bielsa has made a typically radical impression. Previously, the first team and academy players shared the same areas at Thorp Arch but no more. Having studied the architectural drawings, Bielsa demanded the first team be granted their own private space and that a dormitory and games room be created for them.He has stressed the training ground is a place of work and the players are there to work all day. They are in at 9am and stay until seven or eight in the evening – quite a departure from the lunchtime finishes of old. The training is gruelling, mentally and physically, with an emphasis on one-on-one coaching. They will break for lunch and a siesta at the new sleeping quarters.Bielsa has had a bed installed in his office. The amount of time he spends within its four walls, poring over videos, is remarkable. His approach to match preparation – and everything else – pushes the boundaries of total immersion.Leeds’s appointment of Bielsa has had the feel of a coup. The reality of the club’s situation, with recently relegated rivals still receiving parachute payments and the financial fair play rules hemming United in, means they have needed to seek a creative solution.Bielsa is it. The hierarchy believe he offers a competitive advantage in terms of knowledge, experience and patented tactical approach, which is characterised by a three‑man defence, extreme width, aggressive pressing, risk-taking, constant movement and relentless physical effort. The statistics show the players ran more, on average, across their six pre-season games than they did in league matches last season.The Bielsa factor, along with his contacts, was also intended to help with transfers and there has been evidence it has been the case. Guardiola suggested Bielsa take the England Under-21 winger Jack Harrison on loan from Manchester City, which he did, while the Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker, who was chased by several clubs, took a significant pay cut to join on loan because he wanted to play for Bielsa.The anticipation has built around Sunday’s opener at home to Stoke but it is undercut by a number of concerns. Can the players cope with Bielsa’s demands over 46 games? Will he adapt to the Championship? Are his best and most innovative days behind him? Will there be conflict, which has been a theme of his career?It feels as though this could go very well or very badly. Then again, Leeds is not a place for the middle ground."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc37e3387edd998b9a533ea3a109e0fde12d621/296_515_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1459c76505c4d7a1414109d931eabe98","title":"sunderland charlton athletic league one match report","story":"Some journeys are straightforward and others ultimately prove unnavigable but most offer varying degrees of trickiness, hazard and sheer slog.It is still far too early to tell precisely what sort of route Jack Ross and his brand new Sunderland side will take as they plot their way back to the Premier League’s sunlit uplands but at least it started well.In the sixth minute of stoppage time on an unusually warm Wearside afternoon Lynden Gooch, a United States midfielder recently converted to a forward by Ross, headed the winner that ensured Sunderland won on opening day for the first time since 2009.On Saturday, a club that two years ago belonged to England’s top ision began just the second season in the third tier of a sometimes illustrious history and, initially, they found Charlton to be thoroughly disrespectful guests.With their play at times as abrasively impudent as some of the old tackles by their manager, Lee Bowyer, last season’s League One play-off semi-finalists hardly looked world beaters but still revelled in reminding their hosts that they, too, are among the pre-season promotion favourites.It took a half-time switch from a back four to 3-5-2 on the part of Ross, Scotland’s manager of the year thanks to his work at St Mirren last season, to offer a measure of hope to the 31,079 crowd – incredibly more than 22,000 season tickets have been sold.The overhaul of the squad has involved the recruitment of 11 new faces but injuries dictated that five were in the first XI here, with two more on the bench.One of the starting quintet, the former Bury striker Chris Maguire, was directly responsible for Charlton taking a first-half lead from the penalty spot. Maguire’s rash challenge on Karlan Grant seemed every inch a forward’s tackle and he was rightly booked.Lyle Taylor stepped forward to direct the penalty high into the net leaving Jon McLaughlin, newly signed from Hearts, with no chance of a save. A pronounced weakness in the goalkeeping department cost Sunderland dear last season but the early indications are that McLaughlin might provide a long-awaited solution.He certainly did very well to clear up the mess when, shortly after the opening goal, Glenn Loovens hinted why Sheffield Wednesday released him courtesy of a dodgy backpass that left Taylor preparing to pounce once more.After that McLaughlin again kept his defensively vulnerable side in the game by spectacularly saving Darren Pratley’s long-range shot. At this stage Ross’s embryonic ensemble looked very much a work in progress with Alim Öztürk, newly acquired from Turkey’s Boluspor appeared a central defensive liability.Tellingly, Stewart Donald, Sunderland’s new owner, spent the early part of the game hunched forward in the directors’ box with arms folded and a pensive expression on his face.Although Taylor and Grant ensured Charlton were slightly the better side, Josh Maja would surely have levelled things just before half-time had he not shot straight at Dillon Phillips.Unconvinced, Ross promptly switched to 3-5-2 and a significant improvement ensued. A deserved equaliser arrived when Maja met an Adam Matthews pass with his back to goal and turned Patrick Bauer adroitly before squeezing a well-weighted, tightly angled low shot just inside a post.Finally, Sunderland were in control. Phillips duly performed wonders to repel Maguire’s rising, curving, 25-yard free-kick and Watford loanee Jerome Sinclair stabbed wide from four yards before finally, Bryan Oviedo floated the fall out from a partially cleared ball back into the box and Gooch’s head did the rest. Down on the touchline, Ross performed a joyous dance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1010b4c8aa5471eb40eee10ba6fa0fe5b74fb836/0_181_3780_2268/master/3780.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a408e3d6fe17aa68abd9a36b932bb0d2","title":"championship scottish premiership and more football clockwatch live","story":"More woe for Big Mick.

Football’s back! Admittedly, it only loosely went away, the World Cup ensuring that we weren’t bereft for too long. And, let’s be honest, we could all have probably lived with another couple of weeks off, before the grind begins again. But the grind is comforting, the knowledge that you’re never more than a day or two away from a game of some description, and it will be this way, give or take, until May. The English Football League season is two games old, Frank Lampard’s Derby County (FLDC for short) having beaten Reading in thrilling fashion last night, and at the time of writing CCCA (Crisis Club Charlton Athletic) leading CCSAFC (Crisis Club Sunderland Association Football Club) 1-0. And there are a stack more this afternoon, to delight, frustrate, anger and bore you. Where to start in the Championship? With Tony Pulis and Middlesbrough, who travel to last season’s nearly boys Millwall? Darren Moore’s West Brom, starting afresh after relegation last season with a trip to Bolton, a fixture that would have been a stodgy one to avoid in the Premier League a few years ago? Nottingham Forest, who take their ersatz Wolves stylings, having spent a packet on three attackers from Jorge Mendes’s approved list of Portuguese youngsters, to Bristol City? What about Preston, consistently the most under-appreciated side in the ision, facing Steve McClaren and QPR? Or your team, that I have neglected to mention because of the worldwide conspiracy against them?Then there’s League One, which is frequently a barrel of laughs. How will Shrewsbury do without Paul Hurst? Will Portsmouth go one further having just missed out last season? Will Barnsley bounce back like Alan Partridge, the appointment of Jose Morais last season being their equivalent of driving to Dundee in their bare feet? What about Chris Powell at Southend? Will Steve Evans think Steve Evans can do the business at Peterborough?And League Two! We keep going! Will MK Dons be able to deal with the gales of laughter that accompanied their relegation last season? Will Kevin Nolan get past that he sometimes looks like he slept in his car and take Notts County up? What about the Cowleys, still at Lincoln despite much talk of a move elsewhere?So much to keep track of. We’ll also be keeping tabs on the Scottish Premiership, where Celtic kick off their latest procession to the league title, with only Steven Gerrard in their way. Probably.There are 35 games kicking off at 3pm today, and we’ll try to keep you abreast of them all. It’s back. Even though it never really went away.

Sunderland showed great character to give their long-suffering fans a little happiness Charlton proved they’ll be in the promotion mix too, providing there’s a few quid spent to reinforce a threadbare squad. Louise Taylor was at the Stadium of Light. Her report will be up soon. See you later for Sheffield United versus Swansea City!The view of Jack Ross. “I don’t think there’s a better way to win a football match. Hopefully it’s a sea-change for us. But it was a really tough game. We were hanging in a little bit during the early exchanges, but I thought we were stronger as the game went on. We deserved something from it. It was a really competitive game, but winning in that manner is obviously something we’ll take. Their shape caught us by surprise, so I was keen to get two strikers on the pitch. Our players’ desire to get the winner was evident. It’s a small step forward, and we’ve a long way to go. The fans were incredibly positive for us during the game, even when we were a goal down. There’s a perception that it should be easy for us in this league, but that’s far from the case and today was a good example of how difficult it’s going to be, week in, week out. But it was an enjoyable afternoon for them, supporters will go home pleased, and hopefully we can develop a taste for that and do it more consistently.”Goalscoring hero Lynden Gooch speaks! “The club’s gone through a rough time the past few years, and I’ve been here a long time, so it means a lot to everyone. The manager’s been really good with everyone, he’s been really upbeat and changed the mood of the place. You can see it with the fans. It’s a Premier League club, we need to get back, and he’s doing everything he can.”What a magnificent effort by Sunderland! They were not far short of abject in the first half, but Jack Ross gave the side a good old shoogle at half time, and they came out much better for it in the second. A dramatic late winner may well have cleared a few pipes after a couple of difficult seasons on Wearside. This is how momentum shifts! Pity poor Charlton, though, who go away with nothing after an excellent showing in the first half, but were a little too passive in the second.Sunderland have won on the opening day for the first time since 2009! This is how it began in 1987-88.Maguire pulls back the corner for Gooch on the edge of the area. he shapes to shoot ... and takes a fresh-air shot! No matter, because Oviedo picks up the ball on the left, and floats it diagonally into the area. Gooch hasn’t let his head drop, and uses it to guide a brilliant effort across Phillips and into the top left! The Stadium of Light explodes!90 min +5: Solly and Pratley form a yellow wall, and Charlton clear. But Sunderland come back at them. Oviedo has a whack from distance. It’s deflected, and out for another corner on the right. From which ...90 min +4: Molyneux is instantly into the action, powering down the right and earning a corner. Late drama here?90 min +3: Sinclair is down feeling his hamstring and wincing. He limps off. Luke Molyneux takes his place.90 min +2: Page earns a corner for Charlton down the left. Sarr gets to Marshall’s delivery, but can’t bother McLaughlin.90 min: There will be six additional minutes. Some good news for Charlton: Pearce is up on his feet, trudging slowly around the perimeter towards the dugouts.89 min: It doesn’t look as though Pearce can continue. He’s in some distress, holding his left knee. Off he goes on the stretcher. Naby Sarr will come on in his place.87 min: Gooch is booked for a late lunge on Pearce. For a second, he was out of control, both feet off the ground, but he managed to get one boot back onto the turf before making contact with Pearce. It’s probably the difference between yellow and red.86 min: Taylor tries to get something going for Charlton. A left-to-right crossfield pass is sent in the general direction of Lapslie, but there’s too much on it. Goal kick.84 min: Honeyman crosses deep from the right. Oviedo, on the left, hits a low, diagonal, cross-cum-shot across the face of goal. Sinclair slides in, and must score from six yards ... but somehow pokes the ball wide left! Charlton really are holding on now.83 min: Sinclair bothers Pearce into the concession of a corner on the right. Solly manages to clear after a couple of attempts. But Charlton can’t get out of their final third. They’re trapped. They’re holding on now.81 min: Solly is booked for a tug on Sinclair as the Sunderland man wreaks havoc down the left.80 min: Maguire makes room down the right and curls one into the box, looking for Mumba, who isn’t a million miles away from connecting with a spectacular ing header.79 min: Charlton were first to most loose balls in the first half. They’ve been markedly less proactive in this second period, and Sunderland are benefiting accordingly.77 min: Gooch cuts in from the right and is sent sliding across the turf on his face by Aribo. A free kick 25 yards out, a little to the right. Maguire larrups a shot towards the top right. Phillips turns it away spectacularly. Great football all round! Then the ball’s whipped back into the mixer. Maja gets a header on target, but there’s no pace on it to trouble Phillips.75 min: A quick throw down the right releases Taylor into some space. He wins another corner off Oviedo. Bauer wins a header on the penalty spot, but his effort flies wide left.73 min: Marshall wins a cheap corner down the right off a snoozing Oviedo. He takes it himself. And miskicks it, the ball bumbling apologetically to the near post. It’s hacked clear by Oviedo. In the area, Taylor stands, hands on hips, nonplussed.71 min: Lapslie tries to release Pratley down the right, but there’s too much on the ball. Charlton haven’t done a great deal in attack since the restart.69 min: Charlton can’t keep hold of the ball right now. Sunderland - driven forward by today’s 31,079 crowd - have a new energy. Can they find the goal that would give them their first opening-day win since 2009?67 min: That’s got the Stadium of Light singing! The release of 65 minutes of frustration ... scrub that ... two years of frustration. Gooch clips one in from the right, forcing Phillips to punch clear in a panic. For the first time, Charlton are suddenly on the back foot.He’s been tested now! And what a glorious goal, out of nowhere! Matthews slips a ball down the inside-right for Maja, who is just inside the area, with his back to goal. He turns crisply, leaving Bauer, and whistles a low shot into the bottom right!64 min: Oviedo scuffs a shot from just inside the area. The ball deflects out for a corner, which is wasted. Phillips still hasn’t been seriously tested today.63 min: Honeyman embarks on a power dribble across the face of the Charlton box, right to left, then into the area down the channel. It’s a fine run, but Marshall and Solly perform a fine pincer movement on him. Neither make a rash challenge, and Honeyman runs the ball out for a goal kick.61 min: And now Sinclair returns, to a great surge of emotion from the crowd. They’re doing their best to get the home heroes going.60 min: Solly is back, but Sinclair is still off the field, getting stitched up. In the meantime, Maguire drags a shot wide right from distance.59 min: Charlton win a corner down the left, the result of some good work from Aribo and Taylor. From the set piece, the latter nearly gets the chance to shoot from the middle of a melee. He’s crowded out of it just in time.58 min: Sunderland are so dozy at the back. Loovens, not for the first time today, leaves his keeper short with a header back. Taylor nearly nips in. McLaughlin does extremely well to make up the ground and clear.57 min: Solly’s up and about, but leaves the pitch to get patched up.56 min: Sinclair departs down the tunnel, blood squirting from his forehead. He’ll be OK to continue, by the looks of it he just needs a plaster and a new shirt. Solly looks in worse shape, though: he’s flat out for a while, and though he’s now sitting up, he’s leaking a lot of blood from his head too, and looks a little dazed.54 min: Aribo drops deep and nearly slips a clever one down the middle to release Ahearne-Grant. Not quite. Then Matthews goes up the other end, dancing his way down the inside-right channel and making his way into the box without much Charlton resistance. He dinks into the middle for Sinclair, who catches more of Solly than the ball with his head.53 min: Marshall, tight on the right touchline, tries a cheeky whip into the bottom right from distance, with McLaughlin on walkabout. The keeper is wise to the grift, though, and gets over in time to save.51 min: Solly curls one in from the right. Aribo loops a header towards the top left. Shades of the goal that won it for Derby at Reading last night. But McLaughlin backtracks and claims the ball on the line. Sunderland go down the other end, Gooch fizzing a cross through the six-yard box from the right. He can’t find Maja or Sinclair, but the home side have a little more presence in the final third now.49 min: Sinclair is quickly into the action, latching onto a Honeyman pass down the right and purchasing a cheap free kick from a clumsy Bauer. A dangerous position. Loovens nearly gets to the set piece at the far post, but Pearce blooters clear. Sinclair has another run at Charlton down the right, but passes the ball out of play, and the danger is finally over.47 min: A Charlton free kick is dealt with easily enough by the new back line of Loovens-Ozturk-Matthews, but the visitors are soon coming back at them. Pearce barges his way into the box down the left, but can’t find space to cross or shoot, eventually running the ball out for a goal kick.And we’re off again! Charlton get the party restarted. Sunderland have made their second change, this time a tactical one: Luke O’Nien is replaced by Jerome Sinclair. And the hosts are going three at the back.Half-time reading: In case you missed it, the Championship kicked off last night. Derby boss Frank Lampard enjoyed the kind of start Jack Ross is still dreaming of.Jack Ross runs off down the tunnel. He’ll have a few words to say to his men during the break. They’ve been poor, albeit with signs of improvement towards the end of the half. Charlton deserve their lead. It’s going to be a very interesting second half!45 min +2: What a chance for Sunderland to equalise! Maguire takes a speculative shot from distance. He shanks it, but the ball dribbles diagonally, right to left, for Maja, who is clear on goal! But Phillips is out quickly to narrow the angle, and Maja shoots straight at the keeper. What a mood-changer that would have been!45 min: Maguire earns a corner down the right. He takes it himself, and finds the head of Loovens, on the penalty spot. Loovens sends a header to the left of goal. Ozturk tries to bundle it in, but can’t quite replicate this goal:43 min: Sunderland cause Charlton to panic for the first time today. Matthews whips a cross into the box from the right. The visitors can’t clear, and suddenly Oviedo is in a fair bit of space to the left of the box. A heavy first touch means he rushes his shot, which becomes a cross that Maja tries to turn into the net from ten yards. It screws wide left, but for the first time Charlton looked shaky at the back.42 min: Oviedo takes a touch into some space down the left, and pearls a speculative shot straight at Phillips. Pearce is then booked for coming through the back of Maja in the alehouse style.40 min: Gooch has another look from the left, and cuts inside, shoulders hunched, looking for a split second like Ted McMinn. He crosses deep, and nearly finds Honeyman romping in at the far post. But there’s a little too much on the cross. Goal kick. Gooch has been Sunderland’s most promising attacker so far.39 min: Marshall floats a poor free kick towards a bunch of yellow shirts racing into the area from the right. McLaughlin, Sunderland’s best player so far by some distance, comes off his line to claim confidently.38 min: Page makes good for the Sunderland box, cutting in from the left, and he’s bundled over by Mumba. Now it’s Charlton’s turn to load the box.36 min: And then another reminder of Sunderland’s defensive vulnerability. The busy Ahearne-Grant twists and turns down the left and lays off to Lapslie, who dinks into the centre for Taylor. The striker tries an audacious spin and back-heel into the bottom right, a skill that has a difficulty tariff of 6.0, but he doesn’t connect and he’s offside anyway.34 min: Maguire’s delivery is good this time: he curls it down the corridor of uncertainty, and Loovens nearly gets his head to it, six yards out. Not quite, and the ball goes out of play, the danger over. But much better from Sunderland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef078fd642b2ed8ccccbe42f48717553eaa4dab/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4acf1c17242405d77b33a392893ee8b","title":"cosmic orgasm rise of conscious breathing","story":"You do it more than 23,000 times a day, but are you breathing properly?

He claims that by performing this exercise daily (along with a regimen of cold showers and meditation), we can help treat a whole suite of conditions and diseases, from depression to arthritis. “It’s so simple,” he tells me. “That’s why people overlook it. They stay in their brains thinking, ‘This cannot be so simple.’ But it is!”While Hof may be the most eccentric person to tout breath as a panacea for the 21st century, he is not alone. I first started noticing how fashionable breathing had become when I moved to Los Angeles in 2016. One of the first people I met, an English film producer, had just had the word “BREATHE” tattooed on her wrist. New friends told me about conscious breathwork circles and breathing re-education classes. Hardcore gym types talked excitedly about breathing as a “remote control for the brain”. Even Hillary Clinton claimed, in her book What Happened, that yogic alternate-nostril breathing was what helped her get over losing the presidential election to Donald Trump: “Breathing deeply from your diaphragm, place your right thumb on your right nostril and your ring and little fingers on your left…” and so on.Now breathing classes and retreats have reached Britain, too: the Transformational Breath Foundation UK lists events all over the country, promising that “you’ll access the full potential of your breathing system”. “Breathfulness” is touted as the new mindfulness (though one attendee of a recent session in London described it as “yoga without the yoga”). Breathing: once you start noticing it, everyone’s doing it.And, in some ways, it’s inevitable. A whole self-care industry has made us doubt everything we do naturally – eat, exercise, sleep – and breathing is at the heart of it all. Since you do it around 16 times a minute, 960 times an hour and 23,040 times a day, there’s an awful lot of room for improvement.Still sitting comfortably? You can breathe normally now.“Breath has been ignored by the general public,” Dr Belisa Vranich says. I suppose she would say that: a child psychologist by training, she now works at the Ash Center in New York, an “integrative and functional medicine” practice, where she teaches breathing techniques to firefighters, police officers and soldiers to help them manage stress. She now has her sights on the general breathing public. “Pulmonologists have been looking at severe dysfunction. Yogis have been looking at pranayama. But no one has been thinking of the average person like you and me. People are realising that they’ve been completed neglected.”She tells a respiratory version of The Fall humans used to breathe correctly. When a three-year-old breathes, their tummy goes in and out. Same with animals. But at a certain point we started breathing “vertically”. That’s how we’re designed to breathe when we face genuinely stressful situations – but not, say, when our phone pings 150 times a day. The way she describes it, we have been hit by a “perfect storm” not only are we much more sedentary, we’re also constantly responding to digital technology, a respiratory disaster. “When you’re looking at these screens, your breathing changes. You’re like an animal in stalking mode. And, if you notice, you’re spending all day taking incredibly small breaths. The only time you’re really breathing is when you take a big, expansive sigh.” Breathing properly, she maintains, is the single most important intervention you can make for your own health. Cheap, too.Breathing is automatic and not automatic at the same time. Respiratory function is controlled in the brain stem, the part of the brain that controls the basic things that keep us alive, like a heartbeat. You still breathe when you’re unconscious, asleep or anaesthetised. But, in some ways, it’s closer to somatic functions (such as walking) than autonomic, involuntary functions (such as sweating). You don’t have to think about each step you take, you just head somewhere. Your brain automatically adjusts your steps, just as your brain will occasionally insert a sigh when it needs more oxygen. But you can also decide to hold your breath, hyperventilate or, as the more out-there breathwork practitioners promise, use your breath “to journey between the conscious and unconscious mind”.When I first became conscious of my breathing, aged five or so – about the time Dr Vranich thinks we start doing it wrong – I remember experiencing a childhood version of an existential crisis. What if I forget to breathe? Sometimes, I’d catch myself not breathing and worry. Not without reason: I used to faint frequently due to a lack of oxygen in the brain. But somehow I went through the next few decades barely thinking about it, until one Sunday morning last year when I went to report on a communal exercise class on a basketball court in Runyon Canyon, LA, hosted by a group of wellness bros who call themselves the Wildfire Initiative.I was expecting a gruelling session of weights, cardio, humiliation. In fact, it was quite pleasant. The instructor, Bryan Ellis, a singer-songwriter with a face tattoo and a messianic demeanour, told us that since he was “lazy as fuck”, he had finessed his exercise routines right down to the two essentials: walking and breathing. He asked us to lie down and put us through a breathing exercise in which we hyperventilated, then held our collective breath.“I want you to notice that point of anxiety,” Ellis said as we lay under the sun. “Because that feeling of anxiety we get when we realise we need more air is very similar to that feeling of anxiety we get 100 times a day from the littlest thing. This feeling is natural in life-or-death situations, like when we can’t breathe. Not when our phone has died.” I expected to faint, but I felt fantastic. As we hiked up the canyon, Ellis told me that he can hold his breath for six minutes, despite smoking 10 cigarettes a day.I later discovered that his teachings are a loosely modified version of Wim Hof’s patented Method (known as WHM), which has gained a cult following among bodybuilders, athletes and celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Orlando Bloom. Hof is also known as the Ice Man, which comes from his penchant for encasing himself in ice, swimming under bits of the Arctic and climbing up mountains in shorts. (He made it up Kilimanjaro, but didn’t quite manage Everest.) He holds 26 world records for withstanding extreme temperatures, partly thanks to his breathing technique, and runs retreats in Holland, Poland and Spain he also sells online courses, while giving away the basics free in his app.“The autonomic nervous system! The endocrine system! The lymphatic system! The immune system! The vascular system!” he declaims when I Skype him in Holland. “According to science, humans couldn’t actively influence any of these. But we have shown that you can tap into them.” Just by breathing? “Yes! That’s why we made a T-shirt that says: ‘BREATHE MOTHERFUCKER!’” He bursts out laughing. “It’s so good, because it’s so simple!”His thesis is that modern humans live in a comfort zone that’s slowly killing us (and also making us fat: you burn many more calories in the cold). Our ancestors used to be fine mooching around the tundra in loincloths. But as humans have learned to control our environments – with central heating, insulation, coats and so on – we are losing our ability to respond to nature.There’s no doubt Hof is a peculiar inidual. But while he is what you might call “conspiracy minded”, he is careful not to position his method as any kind of substitute for conventional medicine. And there is some evidence that he may be on to something. The American author Scott Carney set out to debunk Hof’s methods for his 2017 book What Doesn’t Kill Us, but ended up broadly convinced. The most credible evidence came in 2014, when a team of researchers at Radboud University in Nijmegen in the Netherlands studied 12 subjects who had followed the Wim Hof Method and found they had an increased ability to resist infection and fight inflammation. The researchers concluded that this had “important implications” for the treatment of diseases that involve excessive inflammation, especially autoimmune diseases. It was a small sample, and it remains to be seen whether it’s the cold exposure or the breathing that’s the crucial factor, but there are a number of further medical trials under way across the world.Still, the notion that breathing is good for you is one of the least controversial things you could say about the human body . “All chronic pain, suffering, and disease are caused by a lack of oxygen at the cell level,” wrote Dr Arthur C Guyton in his Textbook Of Medical Physiology in 1956, one of the world’s most widely used medical primers. “Proper breathing nourishes the cells of the body with oxygen and optimises the functioning of the body on all levels.” Studies have shown that conscious breathing exercises such as the 4-7-8 (breathe in for four, hold for seven, out for eight) are beneficial for a wide variety of conditions. Conscious breathing activates the body’s relaxation response, which in turn reduces blood pressure, which in turn lowers the risk of stroke and improves cardiovascular health. It’s also good for digestion and general immunity, both of which are impaired by stress. Similar techniques are at the heart of hypnobirthing classes, which are becoming increasingly popular. As long as you don’t expect breathing alone to cure you, it probably won’t hurt you.A little more on the edge are the consciousness-altering breathing techniques adapted from various Buddhist practices by the psychedelic pioneer Stanislav Grof at the Esalen Institute in California in the 1960s – now seeing a comeback as part of a wider psychedelic renaissance. Essentially, Grof learned how to induce “natural” psychedelic states through controlled hyperventilation. The author Michael Pollan tries out one such technique, holotropic breathwork, in his new book How To Change Your Mind, and pictures himself on a horse, galloping through a forest, “absorbing the animal’s power”, before returning to normal consciousness to find his heartbeat is all over the place. Holotropic breathwork is not recommended if you have prior heart conditions, as Pollan had. But that hasn’t stopped it gaining popularity in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond.A British entrepreneur, Poppy Jamie, 28, tells me she was so inspired by the holotropic breathing workshop she attended in LA that she decided to reassess her whole career. “We were in this room of 40 people, all hyperoxygenated. And it was such a release, I cried for two hours afterwards.”She decided to “pivot” away from her online accessories brand and concentrate on her wellness app, Happy Not Perfect, which offers a series of exercises and techniques designed to help stressed-out young millennials cope with their hyperconnected lives – a tech-on-tech solution. When she conducted focus groups, Jamie says, the breathing exercises were the most popular part of the app: “My generation found it really difficult to ‘think of nothing’ and ‘meditate’, but breathwork was something they could focus on and feel the physical effects of immediately.” She sees it as being a bit like yoga or mindfulness, but without the complicated bits. “I think more and more people need to hear about breathing. It grounds you in the present moment. In my dreams, there would be a breathing centre on every street corner.”Intrigued, I visit a breathwork practitioner named Federica Ferro at her home in London. She used to work in fashion in Milan and New York, but became disillusioned. On holiday in Mykonos, she decided to submit to a “rebirthing” at the hands of Katia Boustani, the founder of an initiative called Global Breathing Awareness. This is described as a “safe and natural breathing method which connects us with our subconscious mind”. The idea is not to pause between exhaling and inhaling, so every time you breathe out you cut it a little short and breathe in again. This induces a trance-like state in which the conscious mind quietens down, apparently allowing the subconscious to do a little rewiring.Her own first experience was life-changing. “At some point, everything that was in my mind started to dissolve, almost like I was detaching from my thoughts,” Ferro says. “Then I started to laugh. It came up through me and I felt this spiritual liberation. After a while, I saw galaxies, darkness, stars, and felt this sense of belonging. I had this incredible peace of mind. But it wasn’t just my mind. It was my body, my breath, all of my dimensions: everything. And it lasted for quite a while.” When she emerged an hour later, she tried to explain what had happened. “Katia told me, ‘Well, you’ve had what we call a cosmic orgasm.’” Ferro decided to become an instructor herself, performing rebirthing work for private clients at her home.“So what do you want from your rebirthing session?” she asks me as I lie on her bedroom floor. A cosmic orgasm? Instead, I get a sort of waking trance. After a few preliminary deep breaths, Ferro instructs me to breathe in and out on her instruction, establishing a deliberate rhythm. “When you inhale, you can think you’re breathing in everything you need: love, compassion… The exhale corresponds to the surrender, the letting go of everything you don’t need.”At first, I find it sort of stressful. It takes a lot of effort to breathe in and out to someone else’s command. But before long, my mind wanders away from my tangle of deadlines and errands to some other zone. Time bends a little. I emerge after what feels like 10 minutes but is actually an hour. I feel refreshed. Clear-headed. I didn’t quite experience what she experienced, but perhaps the cosmos wasn’t willing. Ferro writes me a list of things I should take from the experience: “I now give myself permission to prosper and flourish in all areas of my life. It is safe to feel all my emotion and let my heart guide me.”I’m not holding my breath.Put one hand on your belly and one on your chest, between your collar bones. Breathe slowly and deeply from the diaphragm. Your belly should expand in an exaggerated way on the inhale, your top hand should be still. This is the sort of “horizontal” breath you should aim for.Now do it “wrong” to feel the contrast. Breathe upwards into the chest, so your top hand moves but your bottom hand is still. This is the “vertical” breathing you should try to eliminate.Exercise 1Perch on the edge of a chair with your back straight. Breathe through your mouth. On the inhale, lean forward while expanding the belly. On the exhale, contract the belly as you lean back – breathe out until you are completely empty. Repeat 20 times. The movement should help situate the breath low in the body.Exercise 2Lie on your back and place a large book on your belly. Take a deep belly breath so it rises up in your peripheral vision. Repeat 50 times, adding heavier books. This will strengthen your core breathing muscles.

She slept on a friend’s sofa in Palo Alto and wrote “lovely letters” to Apple, Google and other digital behemoths, looking for a job. She had studied fashion design but not long into her degree realised it wasn’t for her. It was while she was an intern at Vogue in New York that she had an even bigger revelation. “I was working on vogue, and discovered that you can translate something so rich in print into something even more beautiful online.” That was the point, she says, when she fell in love with digital.But Silicon Valley wasn’t as welcoming as she’d hoped. “Vogue means nothing out here,” she laughs. “Most people see fashion as frivolous and feminine – it’s so frustrating. But I thought, I’m going to make them care about it.”The only company to reply to her letters was a shopping app called Shopkick. Röehrs took a job there and moved to San Francisco. “It’s much cheaper than Palo Alto, which I found culturally vanilla, not very stimulating.” Six years later, she has just joined Rothy’s, a company that makes women’s shoes from recycled plastic bottles, as art director. But it’s the modest fame she’s found online that has propelled her career in a way she never expected.Röehrs lives in Hayes Valley, an artistic, creative neighbourhood of San Francisco. It was once partly covered by an elevated motorway, the Central Freeway, which was seriously demolished after an earthquake in 1989. Almost overnight, Hayes Valley was transformed into a bustling, walkable part of town. Its powerful residents’ association has banned almost all chain companies, resulting in an inevitable imbalance: you can pop out for a deconstructed vintage shift dress but not a pint of milk. “It’s wonderful: no Starbucks, and so many great independent shops,” says Röehrs, “but it’s impossible to find a good grocery store.” The modern, three-storey apartment building where she lives with her partner, Jeremy, and their two dogs is built in a gap where the freeway once stood. Inside, it’s a warm jumble of antiques, books, artworks and plants – the latter something of an obsession – that belie the modern surroundings. The large canvases, mostly portraits in oil, are by Röehrs. “I haven’t sold a single one, so our home serves as a pop-up gallery.”A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf is artfully messy, with titles displayed at all angles. Next to it is an industrial grey wall – actually a cement support beam left bare. An Eero Saarinen oval dining table is from Craigslist, surrounded by mismatched vintage chairs and stools. “I love colour and excess. I’m the complete opposite of a minimalist,” she says. Most of the antiques in the apartment are Jeremy’s. “He’s from a classical home, and had a proper upbringing with real silver and china,” she smiles. “We have a lot of heirloom pieces from his family.”A previously “dark, dead hallway” now has a well-lit gallery hang of artwork – a mixture of friends’ pieces, photographs by Jeremy, and Röehrs’ own “scribbles” and paintings. Plants are everywhere, including a pair of magnificent fiddle-leaf figs standing watch over the sofa. “I know they’re going out of style, but they’re so beautiful,” she says. “I’m trying to replicate a jungle in our apartment. I end up making my way to Flora Grubb (the only plant shop in San Francisco you need to know) and getting another plant. We look after our plants and dogs as if they were our children.”With the success of her “edibles” and her new job, “which is finally, properly in fashion”, Röehrs feels like life is starting to settle into place. “Growing up, I always wanted my surroundings to reflect who I am. Now they finally do.”• Edible Ensembles: A Fashion Feast For The Eyes, by Gretchen Röehrs, is published by Rizzoli priced at £18.95.

At around the same time, a Japanese seed scientist crossed Chinese kale with broccoli to produce a new vegetable in which the stem is as delicious as the tip. It was named Tenderstem. Today’s dish brings together these two plant-based creations – and it makes me wonder: what could we be eating in another few years’ time?White miso is a genius ingredient that makes almost anything it touches taste ine, because it instantly adds bagfuls of umami.

We’re all familiar with boiling grains and serving them with a rich sauce or stew on top, but there’s a lot to be said for cooking them in the sauce itself, so the grains soak up the richness and, in the process, thicken the liquid. Today I have two such stews, plus a quick fritter for when you don’t want to wait.This bowl of goodness is somewhere between a stew and a soup. It’s light enough for a summer supper, but also warming when the temperature drops. Serve in the pot at the table. 1 large head of garlic, top fifth cut off to expose the bulbs80ml olive oilSalt and black pepper300g pearl barley3 banana shallots, peeled and finely sliced2 tsp caraway seeds1 lemon – finely shave off 5 strips of peel, then cut into wedges, to serve½ scotch bonnet chilli400g cherry tomatoes1½ tbsp tomato paste250ml dry white wine800g mussels60ml double cream50g watercressHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Take two cloves from the garlic head and peel and thinly slice them. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil over the rest of the head, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Wrap the head tightly in foil and roast for 40 minutes, until the cloves have softened and turned golden brown. Remove the foil and, when the garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves and discard the skin.Meanwhile, put the barley in a medium saucepan with plenty of cold water and put on a medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and cook for 25-30 minutes, until the barley is semi-cooked but still has a good bite to it, then drain.Put a large saucepan on a medium heat with the remaining 75ml oil, the raw and cooked garlic, shallots, caraway seeds, lemon peel, scotch bonnet and two and a half teaspoons of salt. Fry gently for 10-12 minutes, stirring often, until the shallots are soft and golden brown (turn down the heat if they start colouring too quickly). Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, and cook for eight minutes, until the tomatoes start to break down. Add the wine, 750ml cold water and plenty of pepper, bring to a simmer and cook for seven minutes. Add the barley and cook for eight minutes more, until it has swollen a little in the sauce. Turn up the heat to medium-high, add the mussels, cover the pan and cook until they open – anywhere between three and six minutes.Pour over the cream, add the watercress and plenty of pepper, and gently stir everything together. Serve hot with the lemon wedges.This dish has just enough sauce and couscous to serve without side dishes.

Add the garlic, caraway and tomato paste, and cook, stirring, for a minute, until fragrant. Add the squid and wine, cook for seven minutes, then stir in the sugar, tinned tomatoes, three-quarters of the fresh coriander, a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a good grind of pepper. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat to medium and cook for 20 minutes.Stir in the couscous and cook for 12 minutes, until the couscous is cooked through and the squid is tender, then stir in the harissa and charred tomatoes and cook for two minutes more, to heat through.While the couscous is cooking, put the shallots, vinegar and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a bowl, leave to pickle for 15 minutes, then stir in the olives and remaining fresh coriander.

The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

And a Massenet first in deepest DorsetOpera galas rarely merit reviews all those artists and works can read as dull inventory if you weren’t there. The inaugural concert of Swap’ra, involving some 150 singers, conductors, directors, stage managers and orchestral players – all women picture it – was a different matter, and formidably stylish too. The chance to witness Amanda Roocroft as a nostalgic Madame Larina from Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin, or Catherine Wyn-Rogers and Anne Sophie Duprels, breaking our hearts in Puccini’s Suor Angelica, or Jennifer Johnston and Lee Bisset spinning their unwinding dreams in Britten’s The Rape of Lucretia gives you an idea of the quality.This new campaign (the full title is: Supporting Women and Parents in Opera) is a rallying cry to the opera industry to address gender disparity and to think laterally about how to give better support to singer-parents or carers (men too). Set up nine months ago by singers Anna Patalong, Madeleine Pierard, Kitty Whately and directors Sophie Gilpin and Ella Marchment, this is as thoughtful a pressure group as you could wish. Aware that issues of equality are at last being addressed, it’s giving a spirited push to speed up that change. A network, some bursaries, creche facilities (many singers find themselves paying for both coaching and childcare as they return to work), proper advance notice of when they are required for rehearsals: these are not frightening demands.The gala, introduced by Fiona Shaw, featured 17 scenes, directed by 10 different women and conducted by Jessica Cottis, Alice Farnham, Susannah Wapshott and Sonia Ben-Santamaria. I’ll save you the entire list, but the programme was perceptively devised, with recent music by Elena Langer, Roxanna Panufnik and Josephine Stephenson added to the mix. Among the co-founders, Madeleine Pierard as Bellini’s conflicted heroine Norma and Kitty Whately as a sexy Nerone in Monteverdi’s Pur ti miro shone. Perhaps the most delicious, effervescent scene of the evening was Anna Patalong leading a small and perfectly formed chorus as Giannetta in Donizetti’s L’elisir d’amore. Swap’ra was her idea, though she didn’t shout about it.Patalong was a memorable Tatyana two years ago in Dorset Opera’s Eugene Onegin. Last year she sang Marguerite there in Gounod’s Faust. No doubt many Swap’ra participants have benefited from the singular experience this tiny but vigorous company offers. An unstuffy summer camp rather than full-blown opera festival founded in 1974, Dorset Opera has established a reputation for staging rarities. This year, in rep with La bohème, the company gave the UK premiere of Massenet’s Le Cid (1885), about the medieval Castilian warrior hero.Frequently performed after its Paris premiere, the opera was shunted aside for no obvious reason after the first world war. Perhaps the taste for a story based on a gratuitous honour killing had soured, though its source material – Corneille’s 1637 tragicomedy – is impeccable, and many an opera plot is far more mawkish. Massenet’s score, which has a couple of familiar standalone arias and many grand choruses and ensembles, is a gorgeously vivid affair, saturated with emotion and without a speck of subtlety.Despite the music’s ceaseless fervour, the first two acts have saggy moments, but the last two acts roar by. It’s certainly worth doing, with challenging roles for Rodrigue (El Cid) and his lover, Chimène, taken with punch and intensity by Leonardo Capalbo and Lee Bisset. Paul Gay’s Don Diègue stood out among the well-taken supporting roles. The company’s music director, Jeremy Carnall, steered the performance with engaging gusto. Christopher Cowell’s production, designed by Steve Howell and updated to around the 1890s, caught the spirit of French operatic grandeur without fuss.The entire festival happens from scratch within 17 days, the two operas rehearsed concurrently in the week leading up to opening night. Dorset Opera has no public funding, and relies on box office, patrons, friends and charitable trusts. It gives full bursaries to young participants from the locality. Training and masterclasses, whether for musicians or in every aspect of stagecraft, wardrobe and props, are central. Well-known professional soloists, a 50-strong orchestra with a number of financially supported conservatoire students playing alongside professionals, and a large, youthful chorus (mostly aged 16 to 25) stay at Bryanston school.Performances take place at the school’s well-appointed Coade theatre, which has what you might call a generous acoustic. Under the persuasive artistic directorship of the international bass Roderick Kennedy, Dorset Opera’s standards, and its reach, are ever rising. Le Cid was a triumph, luckily, since luring a Massenet agnostic to a far-off region on a train-strike weekend could have ended badly. Instead, I’m a convert, or on the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f571677f6f9df5e6c92aa4eb8185dfe622bb8d51/0_276_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dc633e36338ebcbe28058c064c999b7","title":"theresa may and emmanuel macron hold brexit talks in france","story":"French president’s office stresses there is no intention to undermine EU’s Michel BarnierIt was presented in the French press as a desperate Theresa May flying to the south of France to enlist the president’s help with Brexit.Fine food and wine served with a dose of politics was on the menu for a private dinner between Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, and May and her husband, Philip, at the 13th-century Fort Brégançon.As the Mays’ convoy wound its way up the rocky road to the fort, the weather forecast provided an appropriate metaphor: a sunny start to the evening, storms expected later and clouds before sunset.Macron had travelled to the state summer house on the Mediterranean coast earlier in the day after his last council of ministers in Paris. The Mays arrived from Lake Garda in Italy, where they had been holidaying.May was counting on a personal approach to persuade Macron to soften EU resistance to her Brexit plan during their “informal” two-hour meeting.The prime minister, in a dark jacket and grey dress with a necklace of large green and white balls, and Macron, in a long-sleeved shirt and dark tie, sat side by side at a table installed in the interior courtyard of the fort. Their advisers were seated either side of the table. Behind them, a union jack, an EU flag and a French tricolore had been hastily installed.Footage of the meeting, relayed without sound, showed much nodding by both leaders.The 13th-century fortress at Brégançon on France’s Mediterranean coast is the presidential equivalent of Balmoral or Camp David.Fort de Brégançon sits on a tiny 35-metre-high rock off the coast, and has been the official summer retreat of French presidents since 1968.Not all of them have enjoyed the stay.Charles de Gaulle, the first president to stay there after requisitioning the site, left after one night complaining of small, uncomfortable beds and that he was plagued by mosquitos. He never returned.Georges Pompidou and his wife, Claude, liked holidaying at Brégançon in the late 1960s and early 1970s, installing the preferred huge white leather sofas and Plexiglas tables of the era.France’s first socialist president, François Mitterrand, held talks with the then German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, at the fort, but only actually stayed there once. Jacques Chirac was bored there, and Nicolas Sarkozy was pictured with his supermodel-turned-singer wife, Carla Bruni, there before they married. They did not return after.Brégançon, where Napoleon Bonaparte once stayed in the winter of 1793-94, fell into disrepair until it was decommissioned as a military base in 1919. Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, have installed a €35,000 (£31,500) swimming pool, partly in an attempt to avoid the paparazzi who have snapped previous presidents and their partners on the fort’s private beach.Inside the fortress is said to be as austere as it is from the exterior and more like a country house than a presidential palace.Stéphane Bern, a French royal expert who visited the retreat, said: “It symbolises the prestige of the state. Everything there is sober and in good taste, without gold taps.” Kim WillsherWhatever May’s expectations, Macron made it clear beforehand that he would do nothing to undermine the efforts of the EU’s designated negotiator, Michel Barnier.“The plan was to go to Brégançon, which is to be a summer residence but also a place for working, and since May was finishing her vacation in Italy we proposed hosting her here,” a source in Macron’s office said.May was going to lay out “London’s position on the Brexit talks and its future relations with the EU,” the source said. “It will be the occasion to clarify this proposal and discuss the political context.”Macron has long dismissed attempts by British negotiators to ide and rule, refusing to become personally involved in the talks and potentially weaken Barnier’s hand.As a result, the Elysée said there would be no press conference or statement after the meeting. “There is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Michel Barnier,” the presidential source added.Pressure is growing on May to win allies on the continent after her Chequers plan prompted two of her ministers to resign in protest last month. She has just a few months before an agreement on Britain’s orce from the EU – due on 29 March 2019 – must be forged in principle ahead of a European summit in mid-October.France is seen as having taken a particularly hard line in the Brexit negotiations, especially on financial services, with Paris already expecting to get about 3,500 new banking jobs as leading players move operations out of London.The source in Macron’s office said Barnier had maintained that any Brexit accord “must conform with the economic interests of the 27 remaining EU members, and the president has always supported this as well.” But Macron also wanted to avoid a “messy orce”.On Friday the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was “uncomfortably high” and such an outcome would lead to higher prices.He said the UK and EU should “do all things to avoid” a no-deal scenario, but added that the country’s financial system was in a position to be able to withstand such a shock.Asked by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether no-deal would be a disaster, he said: “It is highly undesirable. Parties should do all things to avoid it.”Pushed on what no-deal would mean, he said: “Disruption to trade as we know it.” He added: “As a consequence of that, a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3ae03d56f49b749b4a84a45bcc3a6ce949078ef/963_1326_3031_1819/master/3031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8199ffb9a00b2ff62f6a358803d8967","title":"petition to remove mp ian paisley in north antrim criticised","story":"Politicians censure ‘totally inadequate’ number of venues and pressure on postal votesThe electoral office in Northern Ireland has been accused of limiting the number of venues where North Antrim voters can sign a petition to remove Ian Paisley as an MP.Legislation allows for up to 10 centres to be set up in the constituency where a historic recall petition – which could oust the suspended Democratic Unionist party MP from his seat and force a byelection - can be signed over a six-week period.However, the electoral office has decided to set up only three in North Antrim, one of which will be located in a Unionist stronghold.The recall petition is the first of its kind and comes after Paisley was suspended last week. The parliamentary standards committee found him guilty of “serious misconduct” for failing to declare £50,000 of family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government in 2013.He then breached the rules on paid advocacy by writing to David Cameron in 2014 to lobby against a UN resolution on human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.Sinn Féin Northern Ireland assembly member Philip McGuigan said he had written to the electoral office urging it to put in place the maximum number of voting centres and introduce more flexible voting times.“The decision by the electoral office to locate petitions in only three locations in a large rural constituency like North Antrim is extremely disappointing and greatly reduces people’s ability to reject Ian Paisley’s disgraceful behaviour,” he said.“Some people will have to travel up to 20-25 miles to vote in one of these three centres and those who work outside of the constituency won’t have time to vote outside of working hours.”McGuigan said the number of voting centres for the Paisley petition was significantly lower compared with last year’s general election, when 94 ballot boxes were set up in 49 locations across the constituency.He added that some people would feel uncomfortable signing the petition at the Ballymoney centre because of the area’s strong unionist influence.The Ulster Unionist party leader, Robin Swann, agreed with McGuigan that the number of venues was “totally inadequate” for the size of the constituency.“I suspect that this very limited provision, both in terms of locations and timings, will lead to a larger than usual request for postal votes – and whether rightly or wrongly – this may well lead to accusations of voter identity abuse,” he said.However, the chief electoral officer, Virginia McVea, rejected the criticism. “I could have opened one venue or I could have opened 10,” she told the BBC’s Good Morning Ulster. “This runs for a lengthy period – six weeks – and during that period I determined that it would be reasonable to expect people to be able to reach these three venues. In addition there is a change in the law in relation to the postal application.“Anyone who chooses not to attend in person will be able to apply for the postal option and if their details are verified, can receive it within six weeks.”The petition will run from 8 August to 19 September and will be available for signing on weekdays from 9am to 5pm in centres in Ballymoney, Ballymena and Ballycastle.

A thrilling series opener, which, as Joe Root says, is a reminder that Test Match cricket is very much alive. At various stages through the second and third days both teams looked out of the contest before counterattacking with guts. Kohli’s solo hand with the bat was very nearly one for the ages (it probably was), as was Curran’s all-round explosion onto the international stage. Between times, champions like Ashwin and Anderson did as you would expect in a classic, Stokes and Ishant both superb with the ball as well. What a treat! Thanks for your company throughout the week. We’ll be with you again on the OBO for the Second Test at Lord’s, starting on Thursday. Bye for now from Edgbaston. Curran’s turn to chat. “Stokesey is one of the guys I look up to. I do have a strong competitive streak. I am the type of person who tries to play his natural game and not to worry what people think. It was just one of those days, it was pretty special. It feels surreal and I am trying to take it all in.” Asked about his father’s death and the influence on his cricket: “It has been pretty tough. I was still young when it did happen but we have a very strong family and we’re all close and our mum is very supportive of our cricket. I do take that into my game and take as many chances as I can and don’t really think about it too much, that’s when I play my best cricket. I learned that with two very competitive brothers growing up - not to give them anything.”Root press conference. “I am still trying to soak it in. I’m very proud of the group. The drive and determination from the players gives me a great amount of confidence going into the rest of the series.” “We always felt like we were in the game with the ball swinging throughout and we exploited that really well and made it difficult. Sometimes it is easy to criticise the batting groups but the way both seaming groups bowled was outstanding. It was a great surface that made for great Test cricket and it is important not to underestimate how good the bowling was.” On Edgbaston: “There were pockets of play yesterday when you could have thought that there were 60,000 people in the ground.”75,716 the final attendance across the four days. That’s better than 2016 when Pakistan were here, a Test that included both days of the weekend. You can be sure of one thing: when Australia visit for the opening Ashes rubber next year, there won’t be a spare seat. We have Joe Root and Sam Curran coming up in the press conference room shortly. Coming to you now from Ravi Ashwin’s press conference. “The bowlers in this Test Match were always in the game. So I thought we did compete really well and there are a lot of things to be upbeat about. Even when Umesh was batting our hopes were still alive. We are staying positive. This team has a belief we can win from any stage.”Sam Curran is man of the match! What a way to start an international career. On day two, he was the youngest English man to take a four-wicket bag in Test Match cricket, claiming three of those in eight balls as he raced through India’s top order. Then yesterday, he dragged England from 87-7 to respectability and, ultimately, a matchwinning lead with his dashing 63. Fantastic story.Kohli talks to BBC Test Match Special. “The series, I feel, is set up nicely. the fact that we didn’t play to our potential at all and went so close says everything about our side. I think it is going to be a very exciting and competitive series. We thought on day two at lunch we were nowhere near the game. It’s why it was such a great Test Match and why people enjoyed it so much.” Asked about his ton says it was “just like any other” because as captain his job becomes “all about dragging my team across the line.” But he does link that to how he was able to bat for so long. Another stat. Kohli faced only 16 of the 62 balls he was out there for this morning. Credit to Joe Root and the England bowlers in the part they played engineering that. Far easier said than done. Then Stokes came on.Match report on how it all went down this morning. The full package from Vic, Ali and Andy coming through the afternoon. Joe Root talks to Test Match Special. “Last night, that opening spell could have really been the difference in terms of swinging it in India’s favour but the boys didn’t let me down at all. We missed a few chances but we didn’t feel sorry for ourselves and that’s a great sign for us going forward.” He adds some nice words about Malan sticking at it in the slips, taking the clutch catch in the first over this morning to get England going. “It is set up beautifully,” he said of the series. “It is a great advert for the game and for Test Match Cricket.” Not wrong, Joe. Outstanding. A word for Rashid. He was given just one over last night and struck as soon as he was brought on this morning with a picture-perfect wrong’un. Can’t do a lot more than that. “I think that after all the noise on his selection it’s been justified,” adds AB Parker. Feels about right to me. Man of the Match? Probably Curran, innit? I mean, Kohli one of the all-time performances. But these gongs tend to go to the winning team. We’ll see shortly.Stick with the OBO through the post-match. We’ll have both captains coming up at the presentation and on radio. Cricket! Conventional final wicket. Stokes, with the second delivery of his 15th over, got one to spit at the Indian all-rounder off a length and he guided it into the hands of the veteran Cook who did the rest with a minimum of fuss before throwing the ball in the air in celebration. The end of one of the best Tests in modern memory. 54th over: India 162-9 (Pandya 31, Yadav 0) Target 194. Pandya digs leg spin. He takes them down day in, day out. This could be fascinating. He goes at the second offering, down to deep midwicket finding the gap but Jimmy Anderson makes a brilliant ing one-handed stop in front of the Hollies Stand faithful! Once upon a time 36-year-old quicks fielded exclusively with their boots but not JM Anderson. Pandya, still on strike having taken two from the stroke, gets a single down the ground from the fifth ball. So Umesh Yadav, once again, has one ball to see off. In comes the silly point right under his eyeline but the Rashid leg break is short enough for the no. 11 to get back and defend with a straight blade. Again, really well done. Do we have another twist coming? 53rd over: India 159-9 (Pandya 28, Yadav 0) Target 194. Stokes to Pandya, again with the field well spread. “Pandya is going to have to gamble to get down the other end at the end of this over,” says Vaughan. He considers taking one to deep backward point from the third ball before thinking better of it. Nor from the fourth when driving to long-off. Cat and mouse, rinse and repeat. He does take the run from the fifth, to extra cover. Umesh Yadav has one Ben Stokes delivery to get through. Can the fast bowler bat with the bravery of Michael Kasprowicz in 2005 at this venue? Make no mistake, brave he was that day. He does here, right in behind it. Well batted! “What a time to take over the OBO and to remind us of the need to get test cricket back on free to air telly during another Edgbaston nail-biter,” writes Brian Withington. “Good job they didn’t have DRS back in 2005 or we’d be remembering that one as a famous Aussie victory.” 52nd over: India 158-9 (Pandya 27, Yadav 0) Target 194. Just a slip and a short leg, no silly point or leg slip. Rashid brings him forward with three consecutive leg breaks to begin. All nicely flighted. When does the wrong’un come? Not from the fourth: another conventional ball turning away, defended competently. Then beats him with another, this turning sharply! Last ball of the over and it is a full toss. Umesh Yadav does well to knock it out to deep point but, of course, they decide to stay put. Maiden. Phew.51st over: India 158-9 (Pandya 27, Yadav 0) Target 194. Stokes to Pandya, with six men out to begin the over. The visiting all-rounder tries to launch a drive but miscues to deep cover. They decline the single. “Wherever you are in the field for England now you have a chance of a catch,” Michael Vaughan says on TMS. “Who wants it?” Not wrong: he is going to do what he does best and attempt to hit his country to victory. Drives classically to long-off from the fourth ball of the over and he doesn’t run even though there might have been two on offer. In comes the field with two balls to come, Stokes bangs it in short of a length, smacking into the thigh pad. Can he keep the strike from the final ball? “I think it is worth having the third man up for the final ball” says Vaughan. Root doesn’t. Pandya isn’t looking for one though, he’s up and over mid-off for four! So he’s taken the runs instead of the strike. More to the point, Rashid will get a look at Umesh Yadav, the India no. 11, who is yet to face a delivery. Yes it is! It is good! Ishant Sharma didn’t pick the googly and Rashid is in the book with the final ball of his first over this morning. It is a wonderful bowling change from Joe Root. It was a gamble and it has paid off BIG TIME. England need one wicket to win.IS SHARMA OUT LBW? We are going upstairs to find out! Rashid is on and beating him with the wrong’un. Given not out but it looks good... What a time to join you. Thanks Tim for yielding the floor to me as we share the final stanza of this riveting match. I tell you what, if the ECB are determined to “add a fresh tactical dimension” the sport in this country, they could do worse than getting Tests back onto free to air telly ASAP. Anyway, that’s a hill for me to die on another day. When they return from drinks my vantage point of Sam Curran could not be any better: directly over his arm in the front row of the press box. Will the young man stick the landing on his magnificent Edgbaston outing and slip another inducker through the gate? Let’s soak this in together reach me in the usual ways. 49th over: India 152-8 (Pandya 23, Sharma 9) Stokes resumes, and concedes his first run as Hardik, showing some faith in his partner, takes a single. Then a poke from Ishant goes for four to the vacant third man. Come on Joe, gotta have a third man for the tail, it’s the only place they ever hit it on a surface like this. And then Ishant does it again, fending off a bouncer. Ten off the over! And there’s a bit of argy-bargy, as if we needed more spice. India need just 42 more, and it’s over to Adam Collins for the next and very possibly last hour. Thanks for your company: it’s been huge.Here’s Kim Thonger. “I’m sitting outside Waitrose with the dog, listening to TMS through my hearing aid while SWMBO potters inside. When Stokes got Kohli I leapt into the air and now there’s a clutch of senior citizens eyeing me very strangely. I think one of them has called an ambulance for me.”48th over: India 142-8 (Pandya 22, Sharma 0) Now Curran comes on, and there’s a rather pointless delay to check a bump ball, grabbed by Jennings at third-no-fourth slip. Not out. India need 52 England need two wickets.A follow-up from Kola Cielencina (42nd over). “It’s not that I dislike OBO coverage it’s superb. You guys are all round good eggs who really make my cricketing days...but just wanted some sound effects ie that ball thudding into Kohli’s pads!!...Sitting here now watching for ‘wicket’ in bold type out of the corner of my eye.. Keep up the sterling work and many thanks again.” It’s our pleasure.47th over: India 141-8 (Pandya 21, Sharma 0) So Stokes starts with a double-wicket maiden. Fantastic. The ball to Kohli was hitting leg stump the ball to Shami, delivered from much the same spot above Stokes’s left ear, was jagging away. That’s the match, you’d assume. But let’s have one more twist, shall we? And Hardik, the main run-maker this morning, can score fast.“Morning Tim.” Morning Adam Roberts. “I didn’t quite make the 5.00 start here in Cayman and was beginning to lose a bit of heart. Has Ben Stokes just given me that most dangerous of presents - hope?” He has – twice over.Stokes does it again! He angles it in, moves it away, and that’s two in his first over. Immense stuff from Stokes. But it’s not over yet. He’s made 200 in the game, but now he’s missed a straight one. What a bowling change from Root. England are favourites now.Anderson comes off! But it’s Stokes, not Curran. Anything could happen.46th over: India 141-6 (Kohli 51, Pandya 21) Virat who? Hardik is looking to win this by himself. Facing Broad and meeting the ball far earlier than in the first innings, he plays another ravishing straight drive, and another clip to midwicket, both for four. This wasn’t in the script, which makes it all the more riveting. India need only 53 now. England need a wicket, desperately – but does Root, still finding his feet as captain, have the ability to conjure one up?An email from a football fan. “There’s not a pub open this early in town with the cricket on,” says Martin Maloney, “as I do my, ahem, premature preparation for the Cobblers’ game against Lincoln. This is riveting coverage, as I settle for pubs without cricket. As more of a t20 man and baseball player these days, it’s good to be reminded of how great Test cricket can be.” 45th over: India 133-6 (Kohli 51, Pandya 13) Anderson continues, as he probably will till the end of time. Another single for Kohli, on the leg side for a change, before Hardik clips for three through midwicket, and then Kohli glances for four to reach another superb fifty. Anderson raps him on the pad but the appeal is half-hearted as the impact is outside the line Kohli pokes away from his body but the ball drops short of the widest slip. For the first time today, India are getting on top. They need 61 now.44th over: India 125-6 (Kohli 46, Pandya 10) What’s this? A four? Broad goes full and Hardik sees the chance for a straight drive. Shot of the morning, not that there has been any competition: Kohli has faced only nine balls, thanks to his penchant for singles. Broad bounces back by beating Hardik with a short one – too short to take the edge. Get Curran on!43rd over: India 121-6 (Kohli 46, Pandya 6) Anderson beats Hardik with his version of the textbook ball, seaming up and jogging away, but it’s six inches too short to take the edge. India need 73.“Great match and great coverage,” says David Murray. Thank you. “There’s been a lot of talk about how brilliant Kohli has been and rightly so. But if England had held their chances or if he’d nicked one of the many balls that beat him then he would have been out for a low score, so just how brilliant can he have been? Root meanwhile played excellently but was run out by his partner and his innings is therefore again seen as a relative failure. There’s a lot of luck in these things.” Very true. “Also, how ironic that India’s superior fielding and running between the wickets should be the main difference between the teams.” Better use of spin, too – a weapon to open the bowling, not a last resort. 42nd over: India 120-6 (Kohli 46, Pandya 5) Pandya calls for a tight single to mid-on and for a moment the crowd think there’s going to be a run-out, but he makes it. The crowd, so vociferous last night, have been a bit morning-after today.41st over: India 118-6 (Kohli 46, Pandya 3) Kohli, facing Anderson, again takes an early single, getting his nose right over the ball and easing into the gap at backward point. Shut that door! 40th over: India 117-6 (Kohli 45, Pandya 3) Broad beats Pandya with a ball from the coaching book, pitching on off and seaming away, and stays fifth-stump-isa to stop those clips to leg. A maiden.“I may be doing both a disservice here,” says Richard Liddle, “but Curran reminds me of Dominic Cork. Both very competitive and both get more out of themselves than their talents suggest.” Cork made all the difference against West Indies at Lord’s in 2000, when England were in just the tight corner that India find themselves in now.39th over: India 117-6 (Kohli 45, Pandya 3) More tip-and-run from Kohli, facing his first ball from Anderson this morning. Then Pandya, getting across onto off stump, calmly works a couple of straight balls into the leg side for a two and a single. India need 77 and the sun is still out. Is it cowardly to pray for clouds?38th over: India 113-6 (Kohli 44, Pandya 0) Root goes with Broad at the other end. Kohli, who is looking twitchy rather than imperious, takes a tip-and-run single into the covers – England may need a short extra to shut that door. Broad beats Pandya outside off. Both the old boys have been right on the spot.37th over: India 112-6 (Kohli 43, Pandya 0) Anderson starts with three dots, in the channel, before Karthik picks up two through the vacant gully – Root has posted a first, second and fourth slip, but no third man (swiftly corrected). Then comes the wicket. Full marks to Anderson, and to Root for keeping faith with Malan.They’re double-checking in case the ball touched the ground, but it looks fine. Yes, out.First blood to England! And it’s Malan, of all people, who takes a sharp low catch at second slip.To Dinesh Karthik, who batted well last night. He’s standing outside his crease, like Kohli. Jerusalem is ringing out, and a group of five friends are just passing through security. They’ve come as bananas. An email from John Starbuck. “It looks as if Ishant Sharma has another career in prospect,” he reckons, “as a Crazy World of Arthur Brown tribute act.”And here’s Gary Naylor, with a gloss on my game plan. “I feel England need 4 slips and a gully for Kohli early on to attack him full and well outside off stump. He’ll want to assert himself and he won’t be happy letting the ball go. He’ll also want the strike. To other batsmen, such a line would be negative - not to him!” What do you reckon? And how nervous are you? Both these teams have supporters who tend to see the glass half-empty. The weather is on India’s side at the moment, with the sun shining. But the Met Office has some cloud cover arriving at 11am, right on cue, before the sun returns at noon. Michael Holding, doing the pitch report, can see “no tinge of green”. But there are a few cracks...Within this deliciously tight contest, an even tighter one is going on – between Kohli and the rest of India. In the match as a whole, Kohli has 192 runs for once out. His team-mates, or subjects, have 170 for 14 times out. If you give them Extras, which seems only fair, the score is 192-all. Kohli also dismissed England’s best batsman, Joe Root, twice – first with a direct hit, then by posting a leg slip to Ashwin. If India win, it won’t be hard to work out who is the man of the match.

On BBC One’s The One Show on Wednesday, Knight said that the casting of Sylvia was a reflection of progress in theatre. “It’s just interesting that 100 years later, here’s me as a black woman playing the role of someone who was white. “It’s just kind of marking the direction of where theatre is going – the ersity, the inclusivity, and the fact that the music is much more street and modern and contemporary. I think Emmeline would like it.“Most of the show is sung. It’s at the Old Vic, so people who go and see shows at the Old Vic would expect something a little more traditional. This is anything but. I’m not rapping, but I am speaking rhythmically as well as singing the way that people know me to sing.“There’s a lot of hip-hop, there’s a lot of R\u0026ampB, there’s a lot of funk. It’s telling this seismic story in a really fresh way. It’s glorious, it really is.”Written by Kate Prince and Priya Parmar, with original music by Josh Cohen and DJ Walde, Sylvia tells the story of the sometimes difficult relationship between the Pankhursts. In an earlier interview, Prince, whose company ZooNation will produce the piece, said: “Politics and families are a tricky combination, and in the case of the Pankhursts, it severed ties between them. Ultimately we are telling the story of the price each of the Pankhurst family paid for their political purpose.”Sylvia is at the Old Vic from 3-22 September.

This is not her territory and she doesn’t know the rules. Despite being 29, when she wants to ask a question she instinctively raises her hand.Stephen Jones as her estranged husband, Brian, is scarcely more confident, though he has a bullish swagger to cover his insecurity. Given the chance, he’ll scrawl on the blackboard in the only gesture of defiance left open to him, a pathetic attempt to assert control. In Iseult Golden and David Horan’s fraught and quarrelsome three-hander, this primary school represents a schism. It is not just about the educated and the unread, but the haves and the have-nots. In a society organised to benefit the better off, the school is the site of class warfare.And yet Will O’Connell’s McCafferty is the kind of liberal-minded teacher any parent would want. Even the children say they like him. He is attentive, patient and game for a laugh. But whether he knows it or not, he is also a man whose middle-class privilege puts him in control. In a play that inhabits grey areas, his well-intentioned attempts to do the right thing can also look like interfering. It just depends on whether your perspective is from the top down or the bottom up.What he has on his side is language. Instead of “gap”, he goes for “disparity” he speaks with ease of “percentiles”. No problem if you speak the jargon. If not, it is the language of exclusion. Reacting to a volley of abuse from an angry Brian, McCafferty has some justification in saying the language used is “not acceptable for this meeting” – except it reinforces the idea that the only acceptable language is his.This parents’ meeting, ostensibly to discuss the unsteady progress of Donna and Brian’s son Jayden – they might call it a problem with reading and writing McCafferty talks about literacy and learning differences – turns into a territorial war of attrition. Thanks to their experiences of being educated in the same school, Donna and Brian have learned to be suspicious of any intervention that could disadvantage Jayden. They know what it’s like to be rejected, undermined and relegated to the back of the class, and instinctively resist any proposal that could harm their son in the same way.The play doesn’t make it easy the issues of addiction, neglect and broken families that creep into this classroom in a deprived area of Dublin are none of the teacher’s doing. He’s just a small cog in a wider systemic failure – and it is a system that ultimately fails him, too. The play stops short of apportioning blame – nobody comes out of it well – in preference to exploring the uncertain territory where prejudice, damage and failed intentions collide. Directed by the playwrights, Class is tremendously acted in a series of fast-cut scenes that chop between the parents’ evening and the homework club where Jayden and his classmate Kaylie try in vain to make up for lost time. Doubling roles, Morris and Jones capture the children’s combination of physical freedom and emotional vulnerability just as they strike a perfect balance of defensiveness and anger in the adults. There are no answers in this classroom, but many provocative questions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c5efafcd0d5d02b07bc79a220eed4431f875a41/0_279_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c53585331df6813088da53dfb8771e97","title":"on the exhale review traverse edinburgh festival 2018 polly frame martin zimmerman","story":"Traverse, EdinburghAs a bereaved mother, Polly Frame is consumed by thoughts of revenge as Martín Zimmerman’s mesmerising tale of a school massacre hits homeIn the Alice in Wonderland logic of the National Rifle Association, “guns don’t kill people, people do”. It’s an aphorism that pretends to be revelatory but is actually the opposite. At best it is a deflection, at worst irresponsible. The 7,074 people who died in US shootings in the first half of this year do not have the privilege of debating whether they were slaughtered by man or machine. As Eddie Izzard once said, “I think the gun helps.”Martín Zimmerman’s On the Exhale, first seen in 2017 and now given its UK premiere in a focused production by Christopher Haydon for China Plate and Audible, is an attempt to get under the skin of a debate that tells you more about America’s fraught relationship with its history and constitution than it does about reasoned argument. In this story about a bereaved mother reeling from the shock of a school massacre, assault rifle and shooter merge to become one and the same. The gun is an extension of the person carrying it.As the playwright presents it, the student with a pistol under his belt is transformed. Typically, the weapon takes wounded male privilege (because it is so often thus) and replaces it with power. It’s a power that imbalances every relationship. No one will contradict, still less confront, the person in the room with the capacity to gun you down.Dreaming of taking revenge after the shooting, the bereaved woman becomes so transfixed by the rifle she buys (a three-minute transaction requiring no more than a driver’s license) that it becomes a living presence. Venturing into the heart of darkness, she realises she “can’t be trusted to control herself around machines of such seductive power”.Performed in a country where the gun lobby has no sway, the play risks simply confirming our guns-are-bad prejudices. It sidesteps this thanks to the intensity of Zimmerman’s second-person script, which never takes you quite where you expect, and the mesmerising performance of Polly Frame. Still, matter-of-fact and measured, her delivery is gripping in its economy and hits home like a bullet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1115fd72c370dc21e54a60a8eb741f8b973facd7/0_181_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1770b41226ac17598b95eb2bc88e66dc","title":"the greatest play in the history of the world review julie hesmondhalgh traverse edinburgh kershaw","story":"Traverse, EdinburghJulie Hesmondhalgh’s superb turn as narrator lights up these comic tales about the universal significance of loveIn festivals past, the Traverse has showcased a beguiling series of monologues by Daniel Kitson. At their best, they were masterpieces of daring storytelling that painted the small details of everyday lives with such care they seemed to take on universal weight.To see Kitson this year, you have to stay up late for a sold-out run at the Stand comedy club, but the Traverse is satisfying the need for the romantic and the whimsical – with a side helping of cosmic significance – in Ian Kershaw’s science-fiction fantasy about an apparently accidental romance that turns out to have been written in the stars.As the Voyager space probes venture into the solar system carrying Carl Sagan’s recoded anthology of human culture (“People having a good time. People cramming it all in”), we find ourselves among the ordinary shops and houses of a certain Preston Road where, one morning at 4.40am, time has inexplicably stood still. That’s when the directionless Tom wakes up and, having inadvertently caught the eye of his neighbour Sara across the street, decides to write a play called The Greatest Play in the History of the World … Meanwhile, another set of neighbours are embarking on a scientific adventure that will draw him and Sara eternally together.If the piece doesn’t quite achieve the shiver-down-the-spine resonance it aspires to, straining a little too hard to turn the Voyager journeys into a metaphor for universal love, it is nonetheless a funny and charming tapestry of tales that holds your imagination before it reveals its time-travelling secrets.What makes it special, in Raz Shaw’s good-looking production, is the superb performance of Julie Hesmondhalgh as the unnamed narrator, meticulously colouring in the stories of neighbours, friends and love rivals whom she identifies by the footwear she finds in the shoeboxes of Naomi Kuyck Cohen’s set – and also by the shoes she borrows from a willing audience. Looking us in the eye, the Coronation Street and Broadchurch star gives a big-hearted performance that is as warm and generous as it is precise in its narrative control.

One moment he’s in casual repose on the floor, looking earthbound and ordinary, the next he has weightlessly transitioned into a b-boy freeze, suspending his bodyweight on one arm, his legs knotted above his head or split like compass needles. Moments like these are exhilarating to behold, but the thrill soon subsides. For all Iduozee’s obvious facility, his feats of spiralling speed and precision are overshadowed by a frustrating tendency to crouch in the corner, occasionally flicking beads of sweat off his pate into the footlights. He may well be generating profound thoughts at this point, but it doesn’t really translate. An unfortunate sense of self-indulgence settles over proceedings (the piece’s grandiosely meta name doesn’t help matters).The fitfulness of the physicality is exacerbated by the weirdly patchy nature of the sound design. Initial bursts of thrumming electronica and crackling feedback have the awkward, glitchy quality of a school PA system on the blink, so it’s a relief when clacking typewriter keys and watery gushing sounds take over. Iduozee can easily impress and compel, but he needs less ponderous fare than this.

Unable to find anywhere else\u0026nbspto stay and with the night closing in, the White family were forced to spend the first night of their holiday trying to catch a few hours sleep in their small hire car.“We had no reply from the host or Airbnb to repeated phone calls, so we slept in the car until we found emergency accommodation,” says White. “Due to the late notice and the need to rent a new three bed villa the cost to us far exceeded the original cost.”The only villa they were able to find at short notice was available for just one night – at a cost of €395 (£350) – and then they had to move and unpack again 24 hours later. After that, they were able to find a villa for the rest of their holiday, but in total they were £1,700 out of pocket.Eventually, Damian was able to get through to Airbnb. It apologised, and said the behaviour of the missing host was unacceptable. It offered to refund the original £514.93 the family had paid for the villa and gave them a $50 (£38) coupon to be used against a future Airbnb booking. But that was it – there was no offer to refund the huge extra expense they had suffered.Damian was furious. Their holiday had been ruined, they had to pay out huge amounts for a new villa, and been forced to sleep in a car.It didn’t help that Airbnb’s customer service response was gushingly inappropriate. “I hope you’re having a wonderful afternoon\u0026nbspso far,” Airbnb said in an email to Damian as he was in the midst of sorting out the disaster. “Thank you so much for being an Awesome Airbnb User Damian and have a great day!” it added.While still abroad, Damian decided to show how awesome he was by demanding that Airbnb pay up for the holiday. He emailed Airbnb: “I’m very disappointed no one has contacted me in three days and left us to fend for ourselves. You have a responsibility towards your customers which you have not shown to us. I shall be opening a case on our return and writing to as many consumer champions as I can so that this incident and your lack of any kind of help receives a larger audience.”Damian carried out his threat, issuing proceedings in the small claims court as soon as he returned – notwithstanding what he says was Airbnb’s initial refusal to give him an address for a summons “due to security”. Damian estimated his loss to be a total of £1,464, taking into account the refund of the £514 and including £70 for the court fees.The legal threat worked miraculously well. Damian issued the summons on 17 July, and just four days later Airbnb agreed to pay\u0026nbspout his full claim.“We note that in your case, you have been refunded the full value of the reservation, £514.93 We do acknowledge that the level of service provided by Airbnb customer service fell short of our standards and your expectations. In the interests of bringing this matter to a close swiftly, Airbnb is prepared as a gesture of goodwill, and without any admission of liability, to offer you a goodwill payment of £1,464.91, the full value of the claim, including the\u0026nbspcost involved in filing this county\u0026nbspcourt claim.”The lesson from Damian’s experience? Use the government’s Money Claim Online service – it’s relatively simple, and you can reclaim court fees if your claim is\u0026nbspsuccessful.I lost £3,175 on a booking –only through the  have I now got it backJonathan Dooley, 35, from London, planned a fabulous group holiday with 13 friends from all over the world, booking a seven-bed villa just outside Palma, Majorca, at £455 a night. Everyone booked their flights – some arriving from the US, some from Germany, others from the UK – but shortly after booking Jonathan discovered he had been scammed. The property did not exist. It was an entirely bogus listing posted on Airbnb.“I lost £3,175 and had a group of very angry iniduals who had not only already purchased their flights but had also shopped for the holiday. I have made many holiday reservations in the past and have never been a victim of fraud.”Airbnb initially rebuffed his claim for compensation, saying he went outside its payments architecture and was dealing with the “owner” directly. Airbnb says its golden rule is that “as long as you stay on the platform and only pay via Airbnb, scams simply cannot succeed”.But Jonathan insisted that he was aware of scams, and had stayed within Airbnb’s system. He contacted  Money to press his case, with screenshot evidence of his transactions. “I was directed by the Airbnb app to contact the host to confirm the dates and proceed with the booking, and was provided with their email address as the only form of contact. The confirmation email with payment instructions and the welcome email advising that the home awaits our trip were generated through the Airbnb platform to trick me into believing they were genuine. Airbnb gave this host their stamp of approval allowing them to operate, and I strongly believe they should have taken measures to vet them to ensure their credibility and legitimacy.” Money put his case to Airbnb, which is repaying him. Its subsequent investigation found that\u0026nbspJonathan did indeed have a case. The email that Jonathan responded to on the Airbnb site was that of the fraudsters. It said that it constantly “scrubs” its website to remove such emails, but hadn’t spotted this one. It accepted that its “defences missed an email address in the listing description. We scan for this, and scrub out personal information, but clearly this example got through and we are reviewing how that happened.”Jonathan has now found another villa in Majorca, at roughly the same price though much further from the airport than the first one, where the group will meet up in two weeks’ time. “Without your help this wouldn’t have happened – so thank you very much, ,” he says.The lesson for other travellers? It’s probably a good idea to take screenshots or photographs on your phone during the booking process so that you have\u0026nbspevidence later on.A double booking and a €350 bill for ‘damage’ we knew nothing about When Bronia Kita’s university student son and four friends turned up for two nights at an Airbnb in Galway, Ireland, they were told there would be two beds plus a mattress on the floor and a private bathroom. On arrival, they found just one bed and two mattresses on the floor. They felt they had no choice but to accept. The next day, the host said she’d double booked, and they’d have to move. Eventually they were forced to share with a family staying in the same flat.“As if this weren’t bad enough, the host later texted my son, claiming the bed in their first room was broken and demanding €350 to replace it. He replied that they were not aware of any damage and requested evidence, which she did not provide,” says Bronia.Later the host provided a photograph of a piece of wood under the bed that she said had been damaged. “He reiterated that they were not aware of causing any damage, pointing out that the sum of money she was claiming was excessive and asking why the bed couldn’t be fixed. She didn’t reply and he and his friends assumed she\u0026nbspwas just trying it on.”But Airbnb emailed him 10 days later saying a complaint had been filed by the host, and that he had 72\u0026nbsphours to respond. It later upheld the complaint and took the money from one of the members of his party. Airbnb also accepted the host’s claim that seven people, not five, had come to stay, which Bronia\u0026nbspsays is absurd. “Five people stayed in the room, as per the booking, and the host could see this when she arrived to move them on.”Bronia says her son was too young\u0026nbspto battle an internet giant, so she took up the cudgels herself. But Airbnb’s dispute resolution centre – which did not accept calls – emailed that there was nothing it could do.“I must stress that we as a family and my son and friends have used Airbnb on a number of occasions in the past without encountering any problems, but I have since done some research and found that bogus claims are not uncommon – unsurprisingly, if they make it so easy. We don’t even know if the photograph was of the bed my son and his friend slept in. It could be a bed in another property, or even an image from the internet. We were shown no evidence that the bed had cost €350, either, and the website for the Dublin branch of Ikea has double bed frames starting at €75.“Clearly, Airbnb’s system for dealing with damage claims needs examining, as it is ripe for abuse: if a bogus claim is accepted on the grounds of one unauthenticated photograph, what could they do to prove their innocence?” recommends Airbnbers take pictures of the property when they leave and send them to the owner to prove it was left in good condition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a60fcc9627421e5293aa72016c7a8fba909031/0_799_3836_2301/master/3836.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b7cc9583fa388ace69a07b59e7b0d47","title":"peng life the chicken connoisseur elijah quashie deep down vegans want to be us","story":"As the TV adaptation of The Pengest Munch hits Channel 4, the digital sensation talks about bad burgers, his age (sort of) and industry food snobsElijah Quashie, better known as The Chicken Connoisseur and now star of new Channel 4 show Peng Life, is almost supernaturally calm. It’s mid-London heatwave with temperatures hitting 33C, everyone is packed into a hot room at Channel 4’s offices and sweating through their clothes, but Quashie sits perfectly still, wearing a coat – A COAT! (a cream-coloured Nike Windcheater as it happens) – and is not even breaking a sweat.He’s not fazed by anything, from Star Wars actor John Boyega tweeting that he loved his YouTube series The Pengest Munch (“Wish I had this growing up! Lmaaooooooooo”) to the 175 boxes of trainers taking over at home in Tottenham (“I need to lose, like, 70,” he says).In fact, the only thing that gets him heated is chicken – specifically, Nando’s. Unlike the Love Island rejects who beg the company on Twitter for its legendary Black Card, which gives VIPs free chicken, Quashie is not fussed and wouldn’t accept a card. “Nando’s? The last time I ate from there I vomited,” he says. “I got down to the bone, I was seeing pink bits, and then it all just came up. My body speaks for itself.” He was, however, travelling at 90mph in a Lamborghini on the set of Peng Life at the time.Quashie started his YouTube series The Pengest Munch in 2015, which features detailed reviews of chicken shops in London, from the burger sauce to the seating to the construction of the burgers. Each episode, he visits a restaurant and order the same thing: chips, a chicken strip burger and wings. The worst crimes? Chips that don’t absorb the salt, wings that are pink near the bone and badly constructed burgers with “bare lettuce”, which will be rated “dead”, “problematic” “lacking” or a let down for the “bossman” (chicken shop manager).The most charming part about his reviews (one memorable line: “The burger caught me off-guard, ’cos it was hench … but man definitely chewed on a bone”) is their earnestness – he genuinely loves chicken shops and just wants them to serve good food. And he doesn’t feel bad about giving bad reviews. “I don’t care,” he says. “If you put out food that doesn’t bang, that was your decision. And it’s my opinion. I have to keep the integrity of my palette.”In 2016, his show went viral, and support from celebs including Radio 1’s Charlie Sloth led to TV appearances, getting flown to New York to sample the city’s chicken shops with A$AP Mob member Bari and more than 41m YouTube views. There’s a book, The Pengest Munch: In Search of the Nation’s 50 Favourite Chicken Establishments and he’s in a Samsung phone advert. And now he’s got his own show, Peng Life, where he’s joined by friends Nelson and Wilson to rate and review expensive haircuts, kebabs and watches. Celebs such as Jodie Kidd and Rachel Riley also appear, making you wonder: when was the last time Jodie Kidd ate at Chicken Cottage?It might seem as if he’s trying to highlight a class gap and pushing back on the snobby elitism of food critics going for £800 meals in Mayfair but, in his world, they simply don’t exist. He doesn’t read restaurant reviews or follow bloggers or influencers on Instagram. Restaurant critics Giles Coren and Jay Rayner are fans. Did he even know who they were when they Tweeted about him last year? “Nope, and I still don’t.” Savage. When he appeared on ITV News he was asked if he “ever imagined being a food critic”. He calmly replied: “Yeah, that was the plan from the beginning. If I start being a critic, I’m a critic.”And vegans? “Nah. Deep down, they want to be us! They’re making vegan chicken!” Nelson, his co-host, who is sitting in on the interview with twin Wilson, chips in: “The more vegans there are, the more meat there is for us. Keep going with the cause!” You can’t fault their logic.Quashie started because a friend, Elishama Udorok, was doing a BTec (a vocational qualification at college) in media and “was into cameras and stuff. We’d always go to the chicken shop at lunchtime and come back and debate which one was best.” The series, he says, was made for “people like me, my friends, people who I went to school with”.But taking a web series from online to TV is notoriously difficult – just ask Dapper Laughs. The more successful ones (Broad City, High Maintenance, People Just Do Nothing) worked because their creators retained a lot of behind-the-scenes control, while others failed because their niche audience (Miranda Sings) weren’t willing to follow them to TV. Quashie’s motivation when he started his YouTube channel, he says, was to be his own boss. And because of that, the move to TV sounds as if it has been a difficult one.“It wasn’t the plan to go to TV. When Channel 4 approached me in April 2017, it was like, meh,” he shrugs. “But there wasn’t anything more pressing to do. At the time, I was thinking they’ve obviously seen and chosen me to host the show because they want what I have made on YouTube to be brought to their channel. That’s exactly what they explained it to be – but on set it was a different case. In the end, it turned out to be something I should have seen coming but I didn’t.”While making The Pengest Munch, he and Udorok were in total creative control, but with Channel 4, “obviously there’s a director and a producer and they’ll have scripts and things they think they need to put in there, and I’m like: ‘Nah, you guys don’t understand how it’s going to look, it’s going to look better if I do it like this.’”Whatever he thinks of the final product, could Peng Life become a hit, piggybacking on to a trend? Chicken shops have been co-opted by the mainstream in recent years: from rap shout-outs to YouTube series Chicken Shop Date and Drake, Kendall Jenner and Beyoncé endorsing Nando’s, chicken shops are inescapable. But restaurants are also disappearing as London’s working-class areas get gentrified. Chicken shops are becoming, well, Soho House Group’s Chicken Shops.“Places like that, they can’t even make the same chicken – it doesn’t taste as nice. It’s just not worth the money. Everyone there, they could go to a regular little chicken shop, spend £8 and they’re feeding the whole family,” Quashie says.“Chicken shops ARE the culture,” Quashie’s other co-host, Wilson, says, essential spaces for London’s teenagers to hang out. “They’re as well integrated into communities as a launderette or a dry cleaners,” adds Quashie. “No one makes them a big thing, but they’re always there when you need them. And at the correct ones – not the gentrified ones – for a couple of pounds, you get a pretty decent substantial meal and you can’t get that anywhere else.”Quashie is strangely defensive about his age, which is a bit weird, like when your mum gets to a certain age and pretends to be “29 again!” every birthday. He won’t confirm it, saying it “isn’t a big deal. I could be 16, I could be 46. It doesn’t make any difference.” Clearly he wants to appeal to his core audience of teenagers on YouTube, but records at Companies House list his birthdate as May 1993, making him 25. While he looks incredibly young and could easily pass as a schoolboy, meeting him in person, and having interviewed hundreds of forgettable boybands filled with awkward, fidgeting teenagers, Quashie’s intelligent, fluent, carefully considered answers and steady eye contact is a dead giveaway.Despite his success, he says he’s “not even close” to being a millionaire, but YouTube fame means that he now lives a bit like a budget Beyoncé. “I get seen and spotted everywhere, I can’t do the normal stuff,” he says. “Going to a shop or the post office and not getting hassled, that is a privilege I don’t have any more. It’s long. If I’m walking past a school, I get caught.”Sometimes when viral stars get TV deals, the moment can pass before the show gets on air, but Peng Life commissioner Becky Cadman isn’t worried as he’s literally stopping traffic. “When you go out with Elijah, it’s pretty full on. I went to the barber’s with him and this dad who was driving opened the car door, got all his kids out and they were all wanting a picture with him.” She hopes that, as well as the “16-35 demographic”, parents will want to watch the show with their kids.Even though he’s got his own TV show, Quashie says he doesn’t watch TV (apart from Match of the Day) and sees himself returning to YouTube as his next move. “Channel 4 wants to rope in my demographic – on to their channel and into TV again. But for me there’s not much reciprocating. I don’t expect pensioners to be like: ‘Boom, yeah, I’m going to jump on YouTube, set up an account and subscribe.’” He needs a new cameraman – Udorok has got a job at Unilad – and then he plans to go international. “I might take a trip around Asia or Africa,” he says. He’ll probably skip having a Nando’s at the airport, though.Peng Life starts on Friday 10 August, 11.05pm, Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f01e5d0ffaa9320021398c21651cefcca85c8ae/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=500\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7daad543ac9fad343a631d9eacdcc289 1000w","title":"sacha baron cohen who is america","story":"As it hits its stride, has the show, which professes to expose American idiots, actually picked the right targets?These are tough times for political satirists. News bulletins have morphed into comedy sketches, and our political overlords have assumed the roles of pranksters tasked with exposing their own idiocy. What carefully crafted piece of slapstick could compete with auto-satirical campaign manager Kellyanne Conway citing the fictitious “Bowling Green massacre” to justify the US’s Muslim travel ban? Or Trump’s backpedalling on his remarks about Russian interference in which he definitely didn’t want to not support the findings of US intelligence officials?Finding ways to out-prank an endlessly unfolding shitshow is the challenge faced by new Sacha Baron Cohen series Who Is America? (Channel 4, 10pm, Monday). It introduces a series of new characters including gazillionaire photographer Gio Monaldo, Trump-loving citizen journalist Dr Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr PhD, ex-con and conceptual artist Rick Sherman and anti-terror agent Erran Morad. Using the power of prosthetics, Cohen goes to extreme lengths to find the funny in the ongoing political apocalypse but frequently falls on his face.Part of the problem lies with his targets. It’s hard to raise a smirk at the rich Republican couple looking justifiably baffled as Cohen, posing as an NPR-loving liberal, reveals how he forces his daughter to pee standing up to subvert gender stereotypes. Similarly, there’s not much to be gleaned from watching The Bachelorette star Corinne Olympios – hardly the sharpest tool in the shed – being hoodwinked into doing sexy poses in a hazmat suit while pretending to help Ebola victims in Sierra Leone.Cohen’s shtick works better when taking aim at the big guns. His most effective creation is Morad, an Israeli “terrorist terminator” who has some novel methods for repelling aggressors. It’s with alarming ease that he persuades Georgia politician Jason Spencer to yell racist slurs at imagined attackers while dropping his trousers and waggling a pimply arse in their direction. And you can’t help but marvel at his poker face as he runs a beeping “paedophile detector” up and down Roy Moore, the former Alabama Republican senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct against teenage girls. “Maybe Israeli technology hasn’t developed properly,” growls Moore before storming off.Cohen’s talent lies in teasing out the worst instincts of his targets, which is why his pranks only work with bona fide dickheads. His efforts to punk liberal luminaries Bernie Sanders and Ted Koppel don’t fly because neither takes the bait. When he tries to sell a gallery owner bits of cardboard smeared in his own effluent, her peppy reaction seems to stem more from politeness than the prospect of hanging crap on her walls.Who Is America? bills itself as “the most dangerous show in the history of television”, a Trumpian pronouncement if ever there was one. There’s a sense that the hijinks enacted are less about revealing the US’s dark underbelly – which has been hanging out for some time – than putting Cohen’s brass balls to the test. His chutzpah is impressive, but as for exposing the contempt of the ruling classes, they’re doing that perfectly well by themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86d9db225147d09e509490bdc7469e80e629b973/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ad0e636a3b48e2d5c5768fe3747773d","title":"american left morality alexandria ocasio cortez bernie sanders","story":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders talk to  Sarah Smarsh about knowing what’s right from wrong After the 2016 presidential election, headlines described a “ided” United States. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – at the time a 27-year-old bartender, now a progressive political star running for US Congress after she pulled off a fantastic primary upset in New York last month – sensed an underlying problem that was deeper than politics, more personal than demographic data.“I just really felt like our country wasn’t understanding itself,” Ocasio-Cortez told me by phone while campaigning for congressional candidate Cori Bush in Missouri. “We didn’t understand each other, and we didn’t understand ourselves as a collective nation.” It was almost midnight, and her voice sounded strong but tired. Our scheduled interview the previous day, when she visited my home district in Kansas to support another progressive candidate, had been postponed as she navigated her first appearance outside New York. I had figured I wouldn’t get a call at such a late hour and had already changed into my pajamas – an awkward accident that suited the vulnerable questions I intended to ask her about, oh, the meaning of life. As Ocasio-Cortez pondered her country’s sociopolitical disconnect in late 2016, she told me, she considered her part in it. Having grown up in New York City with strong family ties in Puerto Rico, Ocasio-Cortez had limited experience of the rest of the US – not so different, she said, than growing up in a small town.That changed in late 2016 when an organizer invited her to join protest camps demonstrating against the Dakota crude oil access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.Ocasio-Cortez and a friend packed an old Subaru and drove west. “The cigarette lighter didn’t work, so we couldn’t charge our phones,” she said, recalling plugging in at rest stops as they traversed Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota. They talked with people along the way. Ocasio-Cortez recognized their class struggles, so similar to the ones she saw back in the Bronx.When they reached Standing Rock, the destination proved to be as formative as the journey. There Ocasio-Cortez witnessed a “profoundly spiritual experience.” Each night in the camps, Indigenous activists entered wigwams to sweat and pray – an ancient ritual for purification and fortification. “Native American spirituality was the lynchpin for the water protectors there,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “That is where people get the strength.”Ocasio-Cortez was inspired. The next day, when a progressive political action committee asked her to run for office – the smell of campfire smoke still in her hair, perhaps – she knew the answer was yes.What is remarkable about this story is not that she felt transformed by an event that was both political and spiritual. It is that she dares to speak of it publicly.For decades, the two wings of US politics have dealt with spirituality in opposite ways. The God-wielding right proudly trots out organized religion to defend its views, and the secular, postmodern left keeps even non-religious spiritual experiences so quiet as to imply it’s silly or shameful to have them.That dichotomy has resulted in rightwing dominance of the spiritual space in the US. It’s been nearly 40 years since Ronald Reagan stepped into the White House with fundamentalist megachurch ringleader Jerry Falwell behind him. On the surface, during that time – the “family values” platform of so many Republicans influence of Christian televangelist Pat Robertson Donald Trump’s overwhelming support by Christian evangelicals – it would appear that conservatives owned faith.But today there is a marked shift in tone on the left – a reconciliation of the public sphere with private meaning, from social-justice-driven religion to non-religious, even atheist, humanism.Places of worship have become sanctuaries for immigrants at risk of deportation pro-LGBTQ clergy have stepped forward to combat hate within their denominations a rogue group of feminist Catholics is ordaining and recognizing women as priests whether the Vatican excommunicates them or not. An extreme climate is forcing politicians to invoke the concept of right and wrong. To describe government-sanctioned separation of families at the Mexican-American border, for instance, wonky policy language does not suffice.Liberal leaders from Hillary Clinton to Van Jones to Elizabeth Warren have summoned an old-fashioned word more often associated with the right: this is, they’ve said, a moral crisis.Like Ocasio-Cortez, I am a pro-choice woman who was raised in the Catholic church. Now happily non-religious, I’m used to holding simultaneous truths that are often painted as contradictory – like, say, revering hard facts while feeling motivated by something deeper than our minds can comprehend.The Poor People’s Campaign holds that same balance. Begun by Martin Luther King Jr not long before his murder and currently revived by the Rev William Barber of North Carolina and the Rev Liz Theoharis of New York, today the movement mobilizes people of all – or no – faiths across the country to fight inequality. Leaders draw on scripture alongside statistics to call out the immorality of corporate, government and social structures in the US. Among their fans is Bernie Sanders, who was raised Jewish but isn’t actively involved in organized religion. Sanders is not one to quote scripture, but he believes ethical imperative is the foundation of serious politics.“It’s hard to imagine why anyone would be involved in politics if one didn’t have a moral sense of right and wrong, of justice and injustice,” Sanders told me by phone from Washington not long after he visited Kansas with Ocasio-Cortez.As synchronicity would have it, he had a meeting with the Rev Barber that afternoon. Their rhetoric often sounds the same.“We are not a just and moral society when three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America. As we speak this moment, you got 40 million people living in poverty. Thirty million people without any health insurance,” Sanders said. “It is racial justice. It is environmental justice. It is issues of war and peace and trying to create a peaceful world, not a world where countries are aiming nuclear missiles at each other.”Ocasio-Cortez said she’s routinely asked about her avowed democratic socialism, but that political theory is not what drives her.“A moral imperative is absolutely part of how I approach public policy. Because if it’s not there, then what does?” Ocasio-Cortez said, noting that the tattered books that most shaped her politics were written by moral leaders such as King and Howard Thurman. “Everyone’s going crazy about socialism and democratic socialism. For me, that’s not my seat. My seat is a moral seat.” She said that we have long sought to be a rich society while failing to discuss the idea of a good society.“That is why we pay people less than a living wage. That’s why we allow people to be paid starvation wages. That’s why we allow people to go bankrupt in chemotherapy. That’s why we allow people to have their home stripped by a bank that manufactured the crisis in the first place,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Those are not the markings of a good society.” Critics call progressive platforms like hers unfeasible, but Ocasio-Cortez isn’t buying it. “In a society that is materially and logistically and in every way capable of ensuring people are paid a dignified wage, have healthcare, have access to an education and opportunity – if that is materially possible,” she said, “I feel like we are morally compelled to make it so.”In her 1997 book Healing the Soul of America, re-released in revised form last month, spiritual leader Marianne Williamson described our country’s political dysfunction as symptom of a greedy society that has not yet atoned for its crimes against native and enslaved peoples, exploited laborers, women and children. She called for politicians to work for good rather than for special interests or the status quo: “A conscience-based politics cares less for political expediency than for moral truth.”Sanders has spent most of his nearly 40 years in public office shunning political expediency, whether as an independent mayor, US representative and US senator in Vermont or as an anti-Wall-Street Democrat riling up the populist left with his 2016 bid for president.When I asked him whether a moment during his upbringing revealed an ability to stand outside the established order, he recalled seeing boys torment smaller boys on the streets of Brooklyn.“From an early age, I did not like bullies who were picking on kids who were unable to defend themselves,” he said. But dealing with political bullies can be a complicated matter. Sanders said that, when forced to weigh political or financial capital with his own ideals, the decision invariably involves compromise.“I can pick apart every vote that I cast which was a yes vote and tell you that there were things in it that I really, really disliked, without exception,” he said, citing his vote for the Affordable Care Act. “So the judgment there is, ‘Is this what I want? Is this my view of what the American healthcare system should be?’ The answer is no. Will this keep people alive who otherwise might die or become much sicker than they should? The answer is yes. In politics it is never black or white or as clean as you would like it to be.”When I was a kid in rural Kansas during the Reagan era, the prevailing comment about politicians was, “they’re all crooks.” This assessment sprang from geographic and socioeconomic removal from the formally educated, soft-handed places that decided their fates as farmers, carpenters, cashiers and shelf-stockers.But incrimination of corrupt leadership should not go so far as to ignore those who try to keep a pure flame burning amid the toxic winds of politics and government. “To be very honest with you, it is not easy,” Sanders told me. “It’s not easy at all. I would be lying to you if I did not tell you that Washington is a very, very different environment in which to survive with decency. It is a phony environment. It’s an environment where people are very nice to you and then will do everything they can to undermine you. It is an environment where there is an enormous amount of ego. So it is a tough place in which to work, and it takes a toll on me.” Sanders encouraged budding representatives to “find colleagues who share a common sense of justice and those with you in the fight” and make frequent visits with earnest activists. He had just left a visit with Vermont youth involved in an ACLU immigration effort.“It strengthens me,” he said. “It makes me feel much more human, talking to these idealistic young kids who are trying to do the right thing.”While Sanders has surely seen it all behind closed doors in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged what she doesn’t know as a first-time candidate.“I can’t go in with a plan” for staying true, she said. “It’s one thing to say it’s so corrupt and compromised. But you don’t see the small ways in which that is so.”She might re-read her favorite moral texts, she said, or try to visit her would-be constituents back in the boroughs more often than other representatives do. Running without corporate money set the right foundation for the path ahead, she said. Still, “you just don’t know until you get there. But you walk in with an intention and a commitment.”She listed US representatives whose integrity inspires her: Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Ro Khanna of California, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Raúl Grijalva of Arizona. She said she hoped to have the courage of California representative Barbara Lee, who amid 435 representatives cast the lone House vote against the Iraq War in 2001.“I think they’re holding the candles,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I hope to just be one more.”Principled defiance among political leaders does more than affect policy. It inspires people on the ground.Grassroots activist Davis Hammet, best known for co-founding a rainbow-painted LGBTQ activist center right next to the infamous Westboro Baptist hate group in Topeka, Kansas, grew up in a conservative district in northern Florida.In early adulthood, he became increasingly alarmed by the Republican Party’s rightward shift on social issues. But when two conservative bills – to force women seeking abortions to have ultrasounds and to attach teacher pay to student performance – crossed Republican governor Charlie Crist’s desk, Crist would not abide. He vetoed both bills and left the Republican party.“I saw that political courage and I was like, ‘Oh, it’s OK to leave,’” Hammet told me by phone from Topeka. “This is not my values any more.” So much progress hinges, it seems, on what we are brave enough to say.Since moving to Kansas to start Equality House, Hammet has conducted anti-bullying campaigns in Kansas high schools and founded the organization Loud Light, aimed at registering young people to vote.Hammet, who is 28 – the same age as Ocasio-Cortez – originally planned to call his millennial-enfranchising group the Kansas Center for Democratic Participation. But a friend pointed out the distance between the detached language and Hammet’s personal vibe. He dug deeper and came up with the name Loud Light, which he said encourages people to vocalize views built on peace and goodness.“‘Moral’ has almost this uncomfortable connotation for a lot of people,” said Hammet, a non-religious guy who describes his worldview as “quantum oneness.” “But you say ‘loud light,’ and I think people get it. They’re like, ‘Yeah, being outspoken about the good stuff.’”It makes sense, then, that – in a culture whose framework for morality has relied on religion for centuries – many liberals would struggle to find the words to talk about what moves them at the deepest level.Virtue is a murky, subjective realm. Perceived righteousness in the wrong hands has led to countless wars and tragedies. For me, a good guide is this: Any set of “values” that draws lines between or hierarchies among people is bogus.The burgeoning movement for social justice among the religious left, the spiritual nonreligious, agnostics and atheists seems, to me, legit for the way it brings people together rather than ides them.New Jersey senator Cory Booker recently reflected on the concept of unity for an episode of On Being, the seminal public radio show that examines life’s deepest questions. He said one of his favorite books, the 1960s sociocultural analysis The Fire This Time, by James Baldwin, outlines horrifying truths but ends with two hopeful pages about coming together.“Here is Baldwin, who just talked about these fissures in our society, that ends this book by calling to blacks and whites to be ‘like lovers,’ he writes, and to insist upon and create a new consciousness that he goes: Human history is, and negro-American history is, in particular, a perpetual testimony to the achievement of the impossible,’” Booker told On Being host Krista Tippett. “And this is what I operate on, every single day. I am the physical manifestation of these inidual choices that were made, by so many people, to choose light over darkness.”Booker, who told Tippett he had been advised to sound “tougher,” said he now unapologetically lets his love flag fly whether it’s good political strategy or not. Last May, he and Massachusetts senator Warren – both thought to be contenders for the Democratic presidential ticket in 2020 – were the rare politicians to deliver activist sermons from a pulpit at a large conference of pastors and seminary students in Washington DC.The most frequent discussion he had touring for his 2016 book United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good was with people seeking “a sense of connection to other Americans that transcends the things that seem to be iding us, a sense of yearning in this country for an understanding that we’re all in this together.” Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez carried a message of unity when they took their democratic socialist message to Republican stronghold Kansas in support of local progressive campaigns. Their rallies in Wichita and Kansas City drew thousands, and they reiterated the sameness of Kansas people and their communities back east.“I understand that there are differences between the people in Vermont and the people in Kansas,” Sanders told me. “But the truth is that in virtually every area of human concern, the commonality, the common interests, of the people in the two states far, far outweighs whatever regional differences there may be.” Hammet pointed out that even rural areas – on maps, the conservative red area of the much-touted “rural-urban ide” – contain seeds of understanding that might lead more people there to join a progressive movement about togetherness. “Small towns recognize that they need each other,” Hammet said, citing the community ritual of a barn raising. “One family cannot raise a barn. Everyone comes together and helps each other, and there’s a social capital there. It’s not even inherently expressed. Everyone knows, ‘you’re helping me and I’m gonna help you, because we can’t do this without each other.’” Many white rural voters have been written off by the left as a lost cause. But Hammet learned not to simplistically cast others as villains when, through his work with Equality House, he lived next to the homophobic Westboro Baptist group.“You have these people that are monsters of the world, and they’re my neighbors who I see laughing with their kids at the park,” said Hammet, who identifies as queer. “You’re forced to be like, ‘All right, how can I accept that these are normal people that have an extreme view?’ Dangerous and problematic but also human.”Hammet said that facing social woes means looking in the mirror.“Everyone wants to condemn Westboro Baptist church, but they don’t want to admit and confront their own prejudice,” he said. “It’s really too easy to be like, ‘look, they’re homophobic, look, they’re racist,’ but it’s a lot harder to be like, wait I have a little bit of racism in me. I have a little bit of homophobia in me.”For him, facing social woes means looking in the mirror.“Everyone wants to condemn Westboro Baptist church, but they don’t want to admit and confront their own prejudice,” he said. “It’s really too easy to be like, ‘look, they’re homophobic, look, they’re racist,’ but it’s a lot harder to be like, wait I have a little bit of racism in me. I have a little bit of homophobia in me.”Anyone who labors today for social progress has no assurance it will come to pass tomorrow – and if it does it may not be in their lifetimes. This is a conviction that requires motivation beyond logic. This is a civic faith.During Ocasio-Cortez’s recent speech in Kansas in support of candidate James Thompson’s effort to flip that congressional district blue for the first time in 26 years, she encouraged the crowd of underdogs – progressives in a “deep red” place – to commit to changing political outcomes by tirelessly knocking on doors even as pundits and naysayers say they’re wasting their time.That’s how she beat the odds in her primary race, a street hustle that wore holes in her shoes as she spoke to voters face to face.“That conversation can never be un-had,” she told the crowd. “Those doors can never be un-knocked. And the power will never go away.” This reminded me of a line from the bestselling spiritual tome A Course in Miracles, which defines “miracle” not as a favor granted by a bearded deity but as the correction of a misperception – specifically, the shift from fear to love: “A miracle is never lost. It may touch many people you have not even met, and produce undreamed of changes in situations of which you are not even aware.”One change that has been dreamed of, among this progressive set, is a “blue wave” of liberals winning races across the country in the fall midterm elections. Whether that comes to pass, Hammet said the civic engagement that so many previously apathetic Americans are awakening to – participating in “deciding what tomorrow looks like” – is an energizing force with many benefits. “I’ve had so many of my friends commit suicide. One thing I always felt is, they feel powerless to change anything. So I view civics as a health crisis,” he said. “We have to make people feel that power and live that power. The revolution is there. If people vote, it is a completely different world.” No one knows that better than Sanders, who in 1981 won the race for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, by 10 votes. He likened that victory to Ocasio-Cortez’s unlikely win. “She was a 100-to-one underdog,” Sanders said. “Turns out that the opposition was not quite as strong as people thought it would be. We’re seeing that all over the country. Sometimes when you do the right thing – and you organize at the grassroots level and you have ideas which resonate with people – you can do remarkable things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b4520fec66ef41cbd025a88ef3aec3cbcfe5a41/0_0_3500_2344/master/3500.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c237e9a0e127462e4823eaf18c31743 1320w","title":"europe heatwave record temperature uk weather","story":"UK’s heatwave to continue as Met Office warns of thunderstorms and floods in parts of countryBritain is basking in 31C heat, three people have died from heatstroke in Spain as the mercury reached the mid-40s, and a mountain glacier in Sweden has melted so much that its peak is no longer the country’s highest point.Europe’s heatwave is not over yet, with temperatures across the UK this weekend forecast to remain at an average of about 27C (80.6F), and highs of 31C a possibility in London.Alex Burkill, a Met Office meteorologist, said that despite the cooler temperatures of recent days “it is not the end of the hot weather for the summer” as sunshine returns to most of the country.A yellow severe warning for thunderstorms was in place for some parts of England and Scotland until 9pm on Friday.The Met Office said: “Some flooding of a few homes and businesses is possible, leading to some damage to buildings or structures.

Tourists are being urged to avoid the sun during the hottest part of the day and remember that children are particularly susceptible to the heat.Eight places in Portugal broke local temperature records on Friday as a wave of heat from North Africa swept across the Iberian peninsula and officials predicted the scorching temperatures could get even worse over the weekend. Temperatures built to around 45C (113 F) in many inland areas of Portugal, and were expected to peak at 47C (116.6F) in some places on Saturday. Large sections of Portugal are on red alert on the country’s civil protection agency’s danger scale. The highest temperature recorded on Thursday, when the heat began to rise, was 45.2 C (113.4 F) near Abrantes, a town 150km (93 miles) north-east of the capital, Lisbon, the country’s weather agency IPMA said.In Spain three men died of heatstroke. A middle-aged man in Barcelona was found collapsed on a street and taken to hospital where he later died. Two other men – a roadworker in his 40s and a 78-year-old pensioner – also died from heatstroke.Heat warnings were also issued for 41 of the country’s 50 provinces as temperatures were expected to reach up to 44C .

Papua has suffered a simmering separatist conflict since it was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticised UN-backed referendum in 1969 and remains one of its poorest regions. Access to international media remains restricted. Lopez, who was formerly a reporter in Jakarta, said on Facebook that she was on her honeymoon and had planned to visit the Baliem tourism festival in Papua. But on arriving at Bali airport, she was denied entry by immigration and asked if she was a journalist and whether “she had done something wrong to Indonesia”. Lopez wrote she had previously been deported from Papua in 2016, after being suspected of being a reporter. Immigration office spokesman Agung Sampurno denied Lopez was being deported on suspicions she was heading to Papua as a journalist. “Belinda was barred from entering Indonesia on an immigration issue,” he said.However, he confirmed that Lopez was on an immigration blacklist. Sampurno declined to provide an explanation for the immigration issue, noting it was Indonesia’s sovereign right to deny entry to travellers. President Joko Widodo, after coming to power in 2014, pledged to ease media restrictions for Papua, but activists say journalists continue to be blocked when trying to report from there.

A cryptic slogan emerged online: “No. 1 will rest while Ocean takes over the military,” a reference to a rival politician taking power.For now, Xi remains in full control of the government and party, and mentions of him in state-run media are as frequent as ever, but the hearsay is a sign all is not right with China’s most powerful leader in decades.“Such rumours may well lack credibility, but they do offer some indication that the disharmony within China’s party elite is increasing ,” the Hong Kong political analyst Lee Yee wrote in in the online journal China Heritage.This week, an essay by a law professor at Tsinghua University, one of the country’s top schools, made the rounds on Chinese social media. The essay - Our dread now and our hopes - by Xu Zhangrun offered one of the most direct criticisms of the Chinese government under Xi’s direction. Referring to Xi only as “that official”, Xu accused him of reversing years of reforms, effectively returning China to an era of totalitarian politics and a style of dictatorship last seen under Mao Zedong.“After 40 years of reform, overnight we’re back to the ancien régime,” he wrote, calling for the return of term limits, abolished under Xi earlier this year, the rehabilitation of those punished for the 4 June pro-democracy protests crushed by the government and an end to the cult of personality surrounding Xi.“The party is going to great lengths to create a new idol, and in the process it is offering up to the world an image of China as modern totalitarianism,” he wrote.Xu is one among several intellectuals voicing dissent. Zi Zhongyun, an international politics scholar, blamed the US-China trade war on the Xi administration’s failure to implement reforms in an article in June. Wenguang Sun, a retired professor at Shandong University published an essay in July urging Xi to stop spending money abroad on projects such as the Belt and Road initiative, and spend it at home instead.“For the first time since Xi Jinping gained power in 2012, he is facing a pushback from within the party, from liberal intellectuals and so forth,” said Willy Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation and adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.The pushback is also emerging in other ways. A group of alumni from Tsinghua published an open letter on Wednesday calling for the sacking of a professor over his claims China had emerged as the world’s top superpower. Hu Angang, who claimed in a series of speeches that China had surpassed the US in economic strength and technological know-how, is one of many who have echoed Xi’s claims that China has entered a new era of power on the world stage, reversing his predecessors’ more muted global aspirations. Such criticism is an indirect rebuke of Xi’s more assertive foreign policy, and comes as his opponents use economic troubles and failed trade negotiations with the US as pretext to question him, according to analysts.That dissent, while very unlikely to push Xi from power, could impede what had appeared to be his absolute hold over the party and the government. “His position is safe,” Lam said. “It’s just his authority has been dented to some extent. His authority has suffered.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6936fa882a16303f346094864aa7bf94647c4d9a/220_220_2661_1596/master/2661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee20da6dabfb6cc42da249f56847428","title":"leave it out stonewall criticises paddy powers pride bus stunt","story":"The betting company will parade an empty open-top bus in Brighton to highlight the lack of out gay football playersA leading gay rights group has criticised a stunt intended to highlight the absence of any openly gay footballers in the Premier League.An empty open-top bus will feature at Brighton Pride on Saturday to point out the “statistical anomaly” that not one of the top 500 players in the Premier League is out.Stonewall said the stunt, which has been sponsored by betting operator Paddy Power, was “well-intentioned” but argued that no one should feel pressured to publicly declare their sexuality.Kirsty Clarke, Stonewall’s director of sport, said: “Coming out must always be a personal decision. Speculating over why people don’t come out ignores the many valid reasons someone may have for not being open about their sexuality. Focusing on the absence of openly LGBT players often adds more pressure to what is already a high-stress environment in elite sport.”Stonewall also called for the “endless stream of tabloid stories speculating about footballers’ sexual orientation” to stop. In May, the Sun published a story claiming a Premier League footballer had been having a “secret” gay relationship for four years but would not come out because he feared the backlash from fans would wreck his career.Paddy Power called on the Premier League to “boot itself into 2018, and create a welcoming environment for its first gay player”.“We think a Premier League footballer coming out as gay would have an extraordinary effect not just on the LGBT+ community, but society in general,” a spokesperson said.In recent years, Stonewall has been running its Rainbow Laces campaign, which aims to build support for LGBT equality not only in football but across many sports and has been backed by top-flight clubs including Arsenal.The group added: “The more support there is, the easier it will become for athletes to be open about their sexuality, if they choose to. We are slowly seeing a shift happen – for example, there are openly lesbian professional female footballers who are inspiring role models for inclusion in sport.“Footballers coming out can’t be taken as a sign of success or progress in isolation. This is only one part of a wider cultural shift … it’s everyone’s responsibility to make sport more inclusive – including companies and the media.”The FA chairman, Greg Clarke, has said footballers would face “significant abuse” if they came out while still playing. In May last year, he admitted football has a serious issue engaging with people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.“We need to make sure we penalise bad behaviour, train people, work with people behind the scenes, make sure inclusion happens, make sure people who want to come out feel safe,” he told a Stonewall Rainbow Laces summit at Old Trafford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fad0ad9dc3ef54a24f1aa6f2b43fc8345a7da6c/0_345_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f01dc94dd2517659065f2f940133820d","title":"nicaragua musician carlos mejia godoy flee","story":"Carlos Mejía Godoy, 75, was Sandinismo’s pre-eminent bard but changed his tune after president’s 2006 re-electionOne of Nicaragua’s best-loved musicians – a former Sandinista troubadour who became one of president Daniel Ortega’s fiercest critics – has fled the crisis-stricken Central American nation claiming he feared being killed.“I had to leave Nicaragua because my life was in danger,” the veteran singer-songwriter Carlos Mejía Godoy told the opposition newspaper La Prensa. “I was told to get out as soon as I could.” During the 70s and 80s, Mejía was Sandinismo’s pre-eminent bard, with stirring pro-revolution anthems such as Nicaragua Nicaragüita, Las mujeres del Cuá and the Sandinista hymn La Consigna. But the singer-songwriter, who is now 75, changed his tune after Ortega’s 2006 re-election, like many disillusioned Sandinistas who sensed their movement had lost its way.In 2008 Mejía accused Ortega of building a “family dictatorship” that was a “sordid replica” of Somoza’s tyranny and demanded the Sandinista Front stop using his songs. A decade on – and with Nicaragua in the midst of an anti-Ortega insurrection that has claimed hundreds of lives – Mejía has again been speaking, and singing, out. “We live in a country where life is worth nothing but the people must carry on struggling in the streets,” he told El País last month, denouncing Ortega as “the apocalypse”.  The former Sandinista balladeer has also been penning new songs in support of the protesters, among them Monimbó siempre con vos, a tribute to one Nicaraguan neighbourhood that rose up against Ortega. Mejía is now in neighbouring Costa Rica, where he joins a growing exodus from Nicaragua – until recently considered one of Central America’s most stable nations. Last week the United Nations said 23,000 Nicaraguans were seeking asylum in Costa Rica as a result of the “mounting political tensions, violence and serious human rights violations” back home. Others have fled to Panama, Mexico and the United States. During a recent fundraising event for Nicaraguan refugees at a jazz club in Costa Rica’s capital, San José, student leaders vowed to continue their fight for democracy, in or outside of the country.“I know it will be a long, hard and painful process,” Zayda Hernández told the audience. “But one day we will be able to go back and celebrate inside our country – with our families and with all of our compañeros – and say: ‘We did it!’”“It is our responsibility to put an end to this dictatorship,” she added. “Nicaragua has said: ‘No more!’ And that’s the way it’s going to be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52c8b1458335970ffb4ada6abecb4297dad7010/0_82_3692_2215/master/3692.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d9beccd0a0c06f208f029f088a2aa9c","title":"north koreas nuclear programme has not been halted says un","story":"Experts’ report says Pyongyang is violating UN sanctions and continuing military cooperation with SyriaNorth Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programmes and is violating United Nations sanctions, UN experts have said in a report. A summary of the report, which was sent to the security council on Friday night and obtained by the Associated Press, said North Korea was also violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial measures.The panel of experts said Pyongyang had attempted to sell small arms, light weapons and other military equipment via foreign intermediaries, including Syrian arms traffickers in the case of Houthi Shia rebels in Yemen as well as Libya and Sudan. They also said the country had continued military cooperation with Syria, in breach of the UN sanctions. The panel said it was continuing to investigate sanctioned iniduals, companies and other entities in Asia that clandestinely procured centrifuges for North Korea’s nuclear programme and attempted to sell a wide range of military equipment to governments and armed groups in the Middle East and Africa. The security council first imposed sanctions on North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and has made them tougher in response to further nuclear tests and its increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile programme. Many diplomats and analysts credit the sanctions, which have sharply cut North Korea’s exports and imports, with helping to promote the thaw in relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, and the June meeting between the US president, Donald Trump, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The report said North Korea “has not stopped its nuclear and missiles programmes” and continues to defy the sanctions resolutions. The experts said ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, oil and coal involve “increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques”.These include turning off automatic identification systems, which are required to be on at all times under international regulations, physically disguising North Korean tankers, using small unregistered vessels, illegally changing names, carrying out night transfers and using additional vessels to trans-ship cargo, the report said. The US said last month that North Korea was illegally smuggling refined petroleum products into the country beyond the quota of 500,000 barrels a year allowed under the UN sanctions. US documents sent to the security council committee monitoring the sanctions cite 89 instances between 1 January and 30 May, in which North Korean tankers were likely to have delivered refined products “illicitly procured” via ship-to-ship transfers. The experts said if the report was accurate, North Korea would be violating sanctions and all countries “would have to immediately halt all such transfers”.

It would be lovely to have the site examined, dated and verified.“It’s amazing that the path runs directly to the church, where dozens of couples still come here to get married each year on the estate.“It’s also just been documented by an American researcher that tyrant Oliver Cromwell pulled the roof off the church when he confiscated these lands from the Plunketts,” she saidIt was only at the first shower of rain after the dry summer that Emily decided to take pictures.“We had to do something before it disappeared again, so we marked it out with paint and took loads of photographs.”St Oliver was born at Loughcrew in 1625 and ordained a priest in 1654 and later became Archbishop of Armagh.He was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason on July 1, 1681 and became the last Roman Catholic martyr to die in England.He was canonised in 1975, becoming the first new Irish Saint for hundreds of years and among those in attendance at the Rome ceremony was Emily’s grandmother Sheila Plunkett. In recent weeks, a number of crop marks at sites across the Boyne Valley have been revealed due to the dry weather. The National Monuments Service said it was informed last Tuesday of a report of a cropmark indicating a building at Loughcrew and has asked those who reported the discovery to complete a monument report form.“At that point the National Monuments Service will assess the report, as it does with all such reports, against known heritage records for the Loughcrew area.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3585901.1533324385!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scramble for hockey tickets as ireland stick it out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland hockey players Nicola Evans, Yvonne O’Byrne,  Zoe Wilson, Katie Mullan and Hannah Matthews celebrating their quarter-final win over India on Thursday. Photograph: Christopher LeeGetty ImagesBefore this week many of the Irish public might have thought short corners were something dodgy tradesmen cut to finish the jobs more quickly.But now, many people are experts on hockey as the country embraces the unlikely story of the Irish women’s team marching to the semi-final of the World Cup in London.If bandwagon-jumping was an Olympic sport, Ireland would be on the podium every time. But the remarkable journey of this team of amateur players – they were the lowest ranked side going into the tournament – has provoked some last-minute changes of plan.“Literally as the last penalty was taken, there were two or three people with flights holding on their phones who pressed ‘purchase’ when Ireland won,” said Noreen O’Riordan, fixture secretary at Loreto Hockey Club, which is based in Rathfarnham, Dublin.The club has three players on the Irish squad that has reached the semi-final: Ali Meeke, Hannah Matthews and Nicci Daly.The Glenside Pub in nearby Churchtown will be the focal point over the weekend for those from the club who are not travelling to London.The rest, including Meeke’s mother, Adie, are in London for the match.“We are getting well-wishes from people who have never watched a hockey game in their lives. Everybody’s phone has been hopping,” Adie said. “They have been great ambassadors for their sport.”She says all the extended families of the squad members have made it to London for the match and there is now a scramble for tickets, abetted by the fact that many of the countries that expected to be playing in the semi-finals have returned home and handed back their ticket allocations.Ali Meeke coaches hockey at the High School in Rathgar and is studying for a masters in strength and conditioning. However, her mother says she is a “rank amateur”, much like her team-mates.The Irish group, who are asked to pay a levy of €550 a year to supplement their funding, have been pitted against professional teams who have been together for 12 to 18 months.“Most of them are a cross between college students and those who work full time. It is their own free time to give up to play for their country,” Adie explained.Saturday will be a proud day for the Loreto club’s coach, Paul Fitzpatrick, who knows all the Irish squad from club games and under-age hockey.“Irish people love supporting each other. We are a nation that loves sports and we are always willing to converse about sport,” he said. “For the ladies to do well is good for the nation. We are always uplifted by success.”Irrespective of the result in London, an Irish women’s team will play in a World Cup final this weekend. The international over-50s team will play Australia in the masters final in Spain tonight."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Report lists \u0026lsquomassive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products\u0026rsquoGovernment officials claim many Muslims burned their own houses before fleeingGovernment probe serves as indication of growth of #MeToo movement in countryConcerns for expatriates as militants target workers at international food company SodexoJacinda Ardern (38) became only the second elected leader to give birth while in officeHun Sen\u0026rsquos party won every seat in general election which rights groups call \u0026lsquoflawed\u0026rsquoBreathtaking structure in Ba Na Hills attracts scores of tourists since opening in JuneTokyo Letter: The country struggles to continue as normal as heat records tumbleEx-internet czar Lu Wei also charged with bribery in anti-corruption campaignSpy satellites spot ICBM construction at plant near PyongyangBengali-speaking Muslims fear they will be sent to detention centres or deportedBanned opposition party describes election outcome as \u0026lsquodeath of democracy in Cambodia\u0026rsquoRescuers attempt to reach climbers blocked by landslides on island of LombokPhilip Wilson failed to report repeated abuse of alter boys in the 1970sSuper Saturday byelections in Australia result in gains for opposition partiesMedia figures, academics and leading intellectuals targeted on social mediaFormer Khmer Rouge general Hun Sen has destroyed all forms of political oppositionAt least 40 injured on Lombok Island, a popular tourist destination next to BaliOpponents alleged vote rigging after former cricket star came out on top in election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3586843.1533376000!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea has not stopped nuclear and missile programme says un","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Un visiting a trial operation of a new type of trolley bus at an undisclosed location in North Korea. Photograph: KCNA VIA KNSAFPGetty ImagesNorth Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programmes and is violating sanctions including by “a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products”, UN experts have said in a new report.A summary of the report by experts monitoring UN sanctions against North Korea, which was sent to the Security Council on Friday night, said the country is also violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial sanctions.The panel of experts said North Korea attempted to sell small arms and light weapons and other military equipment via foreign intermediaries, including Syrian arms traffickers in the case of Houthi Shiite rebels in Yemen as well as Libya and Sudan. The report also said North Korea has continued military co-operation with Syria, in breach of sanctions.The panel said it is continuing to investigate sanctioned iniduals, companies and other entities in Asia that clandestinely procured centrifuges for North Korea’s nuclear programme and attempted to sell a wide range of military equipment to governments and armed groups in the Middle East and Africa. The Security Council first imposed sanctions on North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and has made them tougher and tougher in response to further nuclear tests and its increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile programme.Many diplomats and analysts credit the sanctions, which have sharply cut North Korea’s exports and imports, with helping promote the thaw in relations between North Korea and South Korea as well as the June meeting between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But the report said North Korea “has not stopped its nuclear and missiles programmes” and continues to defy the sanctions resolutions.The experts said ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, oil and coal involve “increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques”.These include turning off automatic identification systems, which are required to be on at all times under international regulations, physically disguising North Korean tankers, using small unregistered vessels, illegally changing names, carrying out night transfers and using additional vessels to trans-ship cargo, the report said.The United States said last month that North Korea is illegally smuggling refined petroleum products into the country beyond the quota of 500,000 barrels per year allowed under UN sanctions.US documents sent to the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea cite 89 instances between January 1 and May 30 in which North Korean tankers likely delivered refined products “illicitly procured” via ship-to-ship transfers.The documents say that even if each tanker delivered only one-third of its listed capacity, the total volume would be above the 500,000 barrel annual quota. If loaded at around 90 per cent, the US said the tankers would have delivered nearly 1.4 million barrels of refined products to North Korea — almost triple the quota.The experts said if the report is accurate, North Korea is violating sanctions and all countries “would have to immediately halt all such transfers” to North Korea.As for UN financial sanctions, the report said they are among the most poorly implemented and evaded measures.The experts said iniduals empowered to act for North Korean financial institutions operate in at least five countries, which were not named, “with seeming impunity”.They said accounts closed in the European Union to comply with sanctions were transferred to accounts at financial institutions in Asia.North Korea is also using overseas companies and iniduals to obscure income-generating activities for the government, the panel said. And the experts’ investigation of more than 200 joint ventures andor co-operatives turned up a number that violated UN sanctions resolutions by maintaining links with companies and entities under sanctions.The experts said North Korean diplomats also continue to play “a key role in sanctions evasion”, including by controlling bank accounts in multiple countries and holding accounts in the name of family members and front companies."},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Landlords spending thousands on flowers to create \u0026#39Instagram friendly\u0026#39 pubs to boost tradeWhat is behind the WhatsApp mob lynchings in India?Hunt for missing midwife widens to edge of Staffordshire moorlands as sister makes emotional appeal for her returnSouth Korea spycam protests swell as women object to illegal secretive pornSpecial report: How Brexit could push Poland into the grip of EU federalismNorth Korea criticises US insistence on tough sanctions despite nuclear dealHeatwave Europe on verge of 48C record as temperatures put Britain in the shadeIt will be hard for democratic countries to embrace Mnangagwa as someone different to MugabeRichard Bacon reveals how he came \u0026#39incredibly close\u0026#39 to death as he battled a mystery illnessDonald Campbell\u0026#39s Bluebird takes to the water again, watched by his daughterSteve Jobs told daughter she \u0026#39smelled like a toilet\u0026#39 on his deathbed and said \u0026#39you\u0026#39re getting nothing\u0026#39 Manchester wildfires will leave toxic legacy, scientists warnDelay start of the football season, clubs are urged as cracks open up on dry pitchesComment: Germany can no longer hide behind Europe.

They said a key North Korean technique was to turn off a ship\u0027s tracking system, but that they were also physically disguising ships and using smaller vessels.The Security Council has unanimously sanctioned North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.The experts said prohibited military cooperation with the Syrian Arab Republic has continued unabated. They said North Korean technicians engaged in ballistic missile and other banned activities have visited Syria in 2011, 2016 and 2017.The report said that experts were investigating efforts by the North Korean Ministry of Military Equipment and Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) to supply conventional arms and ballistic missiles to Yemen\u0027s Houthi group.A country, which was not identified, showed the experts a July 13, 2016 letter from a Houthi leader inviting the North Koreans to meet in Damascus to discuss the issue of the transfer of technology and other matters of mutual interest, according to the report.The experts said that the effectiveness of financial sanctions was being systematically undermined by deceptive practices of North Korea. Please review our commenting policyLandlords spending thousands on flowers to create \u0026#39Instagram friendly\u0026#39 pubs to boost tradeWhat is behind the WhatsApp mob lynchings in India?Hunt for missing midwife widens to edge of Staffordshire moorlands as sister makes emotional appeal for her returnSouth Korea spycam protests swell as women object to illegal secretive pornSpecial report: How Brexit could push Poland into the grip of EU federalismNorth Korea criticises US insistence on tough sanctions despite nuclear dealHeatwave Europe on verge of 48C record as temperatures put Britain in the shadeIt will be hard for democratic countries to embrace Mnangagwa as someone different to MugabeRichard Bacon reveals how he came \u0026#39incredibly close\u0026#39 to death as he battled a mystery illnessDonald Campbell\u0026#39s Bluebird takes to the water again, watched by his daughterSteve Jobs told daughter she \u0026#39smelled like a toilet\u0026#39 on his deathbed and said \u0026#39you\u0026#39re getting nothing\u0026#39 Manchester wildfires will leave toxic legacy, scientists warnDelay start of the football season, clubs are urged as cracks open up on dry pitchesComment: Germany can no longer hide behind Europe.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/13/10/Cyborg_Neil_Harbisson.jpg","title":"human evolution religion neanderthal modern civilisation","story":"Created with Sketch.Adorn ourselves with technologies as we may, our brains can\u0027t get out of\u0026nbspcaveman combat mode.

Inevitably, since the outer world replicates the inner, there is also a conflict being acted out between them all around the world. And at the moment, so far as I can see, the caveman is winning out over homo deus.I am currently in New York. When I got here the clocks, on EST, were five\u0026nbsphours behind London time. But my biological clock was set to GMT. Hence jet lag, the queasy sensation of shifting from one time zone to another, getting ahead of or falling behind the chronology of the sun. I got over it in a day. I adapted.But there is a larger sense in which we have never fully adapted to a much longer shift in time. The hunter-gatherer co-exists within the city-dweller. I can go about Manhattan, technologically enhanced, relying on satnav and a weather app to guide me, while at the same time, in one part of my brain, convinced that I am hunting a woolly mammoth, and potentially prey to saber tooths.I am both urban vegetarian and bloodthirsty not-so-noble savage. This is the 100,000-year jetlag, which we still haven’t got over. We are the messed-up, conflicted product of asynchronous development (which I date, very approximately, from the hypothetical origin of language).We are out of sync with ourselves. We really do suffer from déjà vu, the sense of having been here before, but long long ago, the primal memory of palaeolithic\u0026nbspbehaviour engraved deep in our neural pathways. It’s probably the fundamental insight of evolutionary and anthropological thinking of the past couple of centuries, from Cuvier and Lamarck on.Flintstone\u0026nbspand Space Oddity, aiming at the stars and still roaming about the Kalahari\u0027 (Getty)Like archaeopteryx, every bird is part dinosaur. In the same way, we are a curious mix of Fred Flintstone and Space Oddity, aiming at the stars and still roaming about the Kalahari. Current conflicts bear this out. In the UK, it’s all about leaving versus remaining. In the US, it’s red states versus blue states. But these arguments could not even exist if that cognitive dissonance was not already in place in the vast collective unconscious.We (in our split psyche) want it all. Red and blue, leave and remain – which is why Theresa May’s dog’s dinner approach might actually stand a chance, since it reflects a fundamental reality. Half-in, half-out is exactly where we are in terms of our development as a species. An intermediate, morally ambiguous state.The great 19th-century French sociologist, Auguste Comte, taking the long view, formed the opinion that humanity had traversed two earlier phases, the theological and the metaphysical, and we had finally broken through into the more scientifically informed sunlit uplands of “positivism”. Maybe he really believed this, but it’s roughly on a par with saying “good dog” to a particularly troublesome beast. It’s borderline wishful thinking. We have somehow managed to telescope Comte’s three\u0026nbspstages into one highly confused state. The inescapable truth of our day is that the mythic never went away. Our thinking is mytho-positivist.\u0026nbspThe global village makes us conscious of how connected we are. Not only with one another but with other species too. Unless you’re Robinson Crusoe, interdependence is the central fact of our everyday lives. No man is an island. We are, as the quantum physicists say, entangled. And yet we are seemingly ruled by manic isolationism and naked tribalism. I offer just a few examples of our 21st-century schizoid mind.We began with sacrificing animals to the gods. Then we moved on to humans. We created a whole religion out of a single act of crucifixion. A religion in which even God seems to think that by sacrificing someone (his son?) he can placate the gods. It may be the most magical feature of fascism. If we get rid of them, all of our problems are over. In Occupied Paris even the Nazis were surprised at how willing the French (some of them) were to go along with this idea.“Why didn’t you provide more evidence for your existence?” Bertrand Russell said he would say to God. He assumed it would eventually go out of fashion. But if anything it’s been making a comeback. Religion is recycling itself. Nothing is more depressing than to see a dogma passed on from one generation to the next, like a baton in a relay race. We can only hope that someone will drop it. I get the need for some kind of emotional reassurance in a world in which everybody dies. But doesn’t it still make more sense to seek it from fellow mortals rather than from an immortal (who is surely bound to be indifferent)?Digital photogrammetry being used to record 3D images of the micro-topography on the tops of the lintels at Stonehenge.

It’s one of the worst things you can personally do for the planet. Unless you happen to be a member of the meat marketing board, no one seriously thinks that meat is good for you. Hunting once had a logic – survival – and it is possible that hunting might have provided the core of our earliest narratives around the campfire. But the industrialisation of meat is just an absurdity.AFPGetty Images)Probably one day this phase in our development will come to be seen as on a par with cannibalism. Meanwhile, we remain nostalgic for the kill. Even if someone else is doing it for us.Everybody now knows (in the empirical part of the brain) that sugar is bad for you. Sugar is the biggest single cause of type 2 diabetes. Even the Tate and Lyle website seems to suggest you might want to tone it down just a little bit. Meanwhile, we continue to crave it and consume it in vast quantities. It made sense when, back in the day, there was so little of it around. Now there is too much but we haven’t adjusted our mindset. Yet.\u0026nbspSimilar to sugar. The positive thing to be said for sex is that it marked a huge advance on self-reproducing amoebas. It may be more fun, although it’s hard to know with amoebas. Sexual bifurcation has served its purpose. But everything a vet was saying to me the other day to deter me from breeding a dog also applies to humans: it’s painful, it’s liable to cause trauma, it spreads disease, and there are enough stray dogs around already. In-vitro casual encounters appear to be the way forward. Thus transcending the frenzied, exhausting performances of masculinity and femininity.\u0026nbspMade sense when our existence really was liable to be cut short by wolves, bears, and man-hunting species. Now, in the age of the anthropocene, it’s all the other way around. Made in the image of a rather vicious God.

Humanity is what poor old animals can only aspire to.Other than dragons, the whole raison d’être of Game of Thrones is to emphasise – quite rightly – how primal we remain in our thinking. Practically everyone wants to be king or queen. Kill everyone who gets in your way. The Old World primate is never far away.Modernity is part of the myth. We remain pre-modern. As Claude Lévi-Strauss points out in The Savage Mind, 99 per cent\u0026nbspof our culture was formed before the invention of writing. The rise of thrillers and “crime” is a manifestation of the jetlag. We still think in terms of a saviour figure, whether detective or not, who has come to redeem the darkness. The cynegetic paradigm (so named by Carlo Ginzburg) embraces both hunter-gatherers following a scent or a trail and a clue-hunting Sherlock Holmes (and a Sigmund Freud psychoanalysing our conflicts). The retro appeal is the key to the success of, for example, Stephen King. Something wicked this way comes. Serial killers are real, but we also re-invent them to have the pleasure of killing them off.Strangely related to “crime”, possibly without the quote marks. The time is more out of joint in our politics than ever. As above we are still looking for a charismatic saviour figure, a Shane-style gunslinger to ride into town and clear out the bad guys, to purify, or “drain the swamp”. The politics of paranoia require us to be afraid of all the other mad tribes out there. Post-truth began around 100,000 years ago, at exactly the same time as truth, when people realised they could lie about practically anything and yet still be believed.\u0026nbspHow literature has been committing mass femicide for centuriesHere’s why Google Translate will never outsmart the human mindA second Cold War is upon us: and we only have ourselves to blamePerhaps the only really interesting question of our times is whether we can ever transcend our atavistic impulses and finally get over the 100,000-year jetlag. Without wishing to strike an absurdly over-optimistic note, I think we can. Are we pre-determined in our behaviour by a 100,000 year legacy (or, in reality, much longer)? Are we locked into our past?I think the answer to this question is that only when we realise exactly how determined we are by our pre-history will we then cease to be completely outflanked by our own DNA. A friend recently put a Neanderthal flint axehead in my hand, roughly 250,000 years old. As I held it I could definitely feel a kind of ancient resonance rippling through my cells. The old ways. I could easily see myself smashing in the skull of some poor passing creature with it. Or an enemy.

Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The number of known instances of tainted drinks being served is relatively small.But it is still a cause for concern, Ms Douglas said –\u0026nbspespecially for parents who might buy hot chocolate for their children or other foods that are dispensed from similar machines.“A child could have easily been a victim of this had it not happened to me,” she said.Food borne illness has also been a concern for McDonald’s, which was in the news recently for serving salads linked to cyclosporiasis illnesses that have made\u0026nbsp395 people\u0026nbspill\u0026nbspin 15 states.Ms Douglas said that by speaking about her experience she hoped to educate the public and also push the food industry to be more stringent in implementing safety protocols.“This was a preventable mistake,” she said. “Big as McDonald’s is, there’s no excuse.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/997210_1.jpg","title":"brexit news jacob rees mogg no deal brexit bank of england Mark Carney","story":"A failure to get a deal with the EU means that Britain would go on to what is known as a World Trade Deal using international rules from the World Trade Organisation (WTO).Senior Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the powerful pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), hit out at the Governor who has been facing criticism since he played a key role in George Osborne\u0026rsquos Project Fear campaign during the referendum.Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoMark Carney has long been the high priest of Project Fear whose reputation for inaccurate politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the Bank of England.Senior Brexiteers have argued that this option is \u0026ldquothe best option because it will mean the UK is completely free of EU red tape and regulations and can strike trade deals around the world.

Parties should do all things to avoid it.Pushed on what no deal would mean for people, Mr Carney said disruption to trade as we know it before adding: As a consequence of that, a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time.Our job at the Bank of England is to make sure those issues don\u0027t happen in the financial system so that people will have things to worry about in a no-deal Brexit, which is still a relatively unlikely possibility but it is a possibility.But what we don\u0027t want to have is people worrying about their money in the bank, whether or not they can get a loan from the bank - whether for a mortgage or for a business idea - and we have put the banks through the wringer well in advance of this to make sure they have the capital.

We may finally be seeing a Brexit breakthrough - EXPRESS COMMENT                 \u0026lsquoThe EU DON\u0026rsquoT CARE about Irish border\u0026rsquo - Brexiteer ATTACKS Brussels\u0026ldquoThey would have no reason to make concessions or further payments to the EU, other than for past commitments and for participation in selected future joint activities.\u0026ldquoAnd Mrs May domestic political opposition would be limited to those who want to reverse the referendum, a far less daunting task than at present. The government could then concentrate on making free trade agreements with the EU and others over the transition period.In the EU\u0026rsquos no deal preparation notices to stakeholders, Brussels spells out a bleak future where they warn of driving and pilots\u0026rsquo licences becoming invalid, access to the bloc\u0026rsquos airline market rescinded and no mutual recognition of conformity assessment.Britain would have to strike a series of bilateral agreements with EU members because there even with WTO rules if there are no formal relations with the EU then trade is heavily restricted in both directions.For example, without the valid paperwork for goods to circulate in the EU\u0026rsquos market exports would have to named importer inside the bloc to re-certify products \u0026ndash a considerable cost to business.In the wake of Brexit, we look at the 28 member states that are in the European Union.                    Getty1 of 29Countries that are in the European Union Also, a number of foodstuffs would have to be erted to border inspection posts \u0026ndash once again costing time and money.These are known as non-tariff barriers, which modern free trade agreements seek to breakdown in order to facilitate market access. Standards play a large part in this. For example, labelling on cosmetic products sold within the EU must indicate the period after opening for which it is safe to use them.A study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research finds a WTO scenario would cost the UK \u0026ldquo1.77 percent of GBP, which includes the cost of \u0026pound22bn for non-tariff barriers.If the Government can prepare to breakdown non-tariff barriers then WTO rules can be highly profitable, according to the number of studies.

It is an orchestrated plot, backed by millions of pounds . . . a script written the day Remain lost the referendum.The plan was always to reverse defeat by throwing up endless obstacles, by concocting myriad excuses to de-legitimise a vote they would never have questioned had they won . . .  and by relaunching Project Fear to terrify the country about the consequences.Like minds among MPs and the media would amplify each other’s panic in a feedback loop reaching a deafening howl. And they are succeeding. A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities? What about the destruction of trust in democracy? The inevitable breakdown of law and order? Would riots bother them?

It’s hard to think of something more obviously anti-Semitic.But why did he apologise? He still thinks the same thing.He has never met with a senior Israeli government member. He has gone out of his way to avoid meeting the Israeli Prime Minister. He has called the genocidal Islamist terrorists Hamas his “friends”. He has failed to take action against the virulent Jew-hating in his party.He’s not sorry at all about having attended that foul gathering.He’s only sorry it got him into more bother.So, an anti-Semite and a hypocrite.Salman repaid that kindness by murdering 22 children and adults at the Manchester Arena.The lesson?

The heaviest smokers spend four per cent of their income on ready-made cigarettes.This was equivalent to around £1,000 in 2014, the latest year studied.Some 15.1 per cent of British adults - 7.4million people - smoke and six in ten want to quit, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.The Government is said to be considering a tax on e-cigs, which are used by 2.8million adults.The study findings are published in the journal BMJ Tobacco Control.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jealousy is basically a non-issue at this point. We know where we stand with each other.”When it comes to their families, Lindsay said “95 per cent are accepting” adding there “are a couple of people that are not accepting for religious reasons”.The three have matching tattoos that represent their love for each other, one is a triangle to symbolise their triad and the other is a moth that symbolises that their relationship was a flame worth getting burned for.“Its simple, love who you love,” Lindsay said.“People will always try to shove their opinion down your throat, but believe in what you have enough to not care.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424600465.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sas legend andy mcnab outlines eight military moves to help keep your dinner safe from squadrons of seagulls","story":"And that’s not the only meal they’re feasting on.Yesterday we told you how a gull bit a woman’s lip and took the McDonald’s hash brown she bought for breakfast in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.Seagulls’ daring raids have come after the sea’s fish stocks have dwindled, forcing them to steal holidaymakers’ fish suppers.With a wingspan of up to 5ft and weighing up to 4lbs, the squadrons of emboldened birds are not easy to evade – and it is illegal to harm them.Thankfully, SAS hero and author Andy McNab has a Seagull Assault Survival plan. Here are his top tips to keep your dinner safe.“It is important to disguise your bag of chips because gulls are smart enough to know what they look like. You could put the chip bag in a carrier bag in order to camouflage it.”“Put a napkin over chips to prevent the grease shining, as the gulls will see that from above. Reduce the amount of vinegar, the liquid increases shine.”“The gulls will spot your shadow, so sit in the shade rather than out in the sunlight. You could choose a shelter or sit beside a building.”“If you are in the park overlooking the sea, make sure you have ground behind you. Avoid the highest ground, where your silhouette can be projected.”“The more spaced-out you are from your mates or family, the less chance there is of the group becoming a target. Gulls swoop on a large bunches of people as they have more chance of grabbing food.”“In the animal kingdom the more still you are, the greater your chance of survival. Movement catches the eye of a predator. The closer the bag of chips is to your mouth, the less movement there will be.”“Holidaymakers must be aware of what is going on above them. In the Army you watch for aircraft, and at the seaside you need to look to the skies for gulls.”“If all else fails, you need to do what an infantry soldier would do if they are ­discovered – fight back. Have a plan so you are not flapping. Keep one hand on the chips because that’s the prize both you and the gull want. Then keep the chip-eating hand free to swipe the gull away.

it is only the proportion used for the scheme which is increasing to at least 29 per cent.A spokesman told The Sun Online that people in war-ravaged Yemen and Syrian refugees currently in Lebanon will benefit.According to the department’s latest report, the UK could be spending more than £300 million per year -

as Parliament first needs to be consulted this Autumn.The amount claimants are owed depends on your original payment and personal circumstances, so it will vary from case to case.Blogger Frank Zola, who obtained the figures, told the Mirror all those whod been sanctioned under the original schemes should be refunded the full £130million.But the DWP insisted there was no reason to refund all claimants sanctioned between 2011 and 2013.In its FOI response, the department said sanctions are an important part of a fair and effective welfare system.You need to:To find out if you are eligible contact the DWP helpline on 0345 608 8545In a statement the DWP added: It would be unfair and unacceptable that claimants who have failed to take all reasonable steps to increase their chances of finding work obtained advantage over claimants who complied with the benefit conditionality requirements.Today a spokesman added: “We are currently consulting with Parliament on these changes and will publish our response in due course.”If you think you might be eligible, you should call the DWP helpline on 0345 608 8545."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424708943.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"europe heatwave temperatures iberia record latest","story":"The mercury is expected to rise to a burning 46C in Portugal, just fractionally below Californias Death Valley -

Mainly because this decision - highly symbolic as it might be - was actually unusually uncontroversial. Every one of the nine MPC members voted for it - the first time there has been unanimity for a rate increase in more than a decade.The move was widely anticipated in financial markets. And the Bank said that while it would take a tiny bit off economic growth, it was unlikely to leave a major dent in the economy. Many people within the economy fraternity have spent the past decade or so fretting about what higher interest rates would do to households. Now it has happened why is everyone so relaxed about it?In part, it is because that is precisely what the Bank and its governor, Mark Carney, had planned for. So much of their effort over the past few years, from forward guidance to speeches on this matter, has been aimed at trying to ready the country for the fact that borrowing costs would have to eventually return to normal.The message seems to have been received.On the surface, the statistics suggest that the country should be able to absorb the extra costs.For households which are net savers, the consequent increase in savings rates, after nearly a decade of near-zero returns, should come as an immense relief."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-nasa-astronauts-of-first-flight-tests_4380038.jpg?20180804005800 ","title":"nasa announces crew for private spaceship","story":"\"For the first time since 2011, we are on the brink of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,\" Jim Bridenstine, NASA administrator, said.President Donald Trump hailed the announcement on Twitter: \"We have the greatest facilities in the world and we are now letting the private sector pay to use them.

I’m doing so because I believe that, over the last two years, our political leaders have let all of us down, whether we voted for or against Brexit. Two years ago, immediately after the referendum, we were told by both sides that the decision to leave was the biggest thing to hit the United Kingdom since the Second World War. It was a crisis, and what do we do in times of crisis? We come together. That is what we should have done. There should have been a cross-party and inclusive group to conduct the negotiations and we should have worked on a proposal that would, at the minimum, have appealed to a majority of those who voted in the referendum.  The last general election even returned a hung Parliament – a sign that the people did not think one party could do this on its own. Instead, what Theresa May has done is to limit the debate to the agenda of warring factions inside her own party. Everyone else – all of us – has been shut out. In the last two years we have seen no progress and, in that time, a whole new generation of voters, who were not allowed to vote two years ago, have now become eligible but have been forced to watch while their future is debated in front of them and they have no say whatsoever.

And it’s 70 years since we introduced our proudest \u0026shyachievement – the National Health Service. But this week, and like the last few months before it, Labour has been \u0026shydominated by claims and counter claims about anti-Semitism. Before the Houses of Parliament broke for summer, I attended one of the bitterest Labour parliamentary meetings in my 48 years there.  It stemmed from Margaret Hodge calling Jeremy Corbyn a “f***ing anti-Semite” and a “racist” .  I felt compelled to say I utterly rejected her view that Labour is perceived by most Jews, thousands of party members, and millions of members of the public as anti-Semitic and racist. Then we heard anti-Corbyn MP Ian Austin verbally abuse the party chairman Ian Lavery.  And pro-Corbyn supporter Peter Willsman on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee stupidly referred to some Jewish people complaining about anti-Semitism as “Trump fanatics” .    Now we discover that Corbyn spoke at a meeting in 2010 where someone compared the Israeli government to Nazis – even though it was barely reported that the person was Jewish and a Holocaust survivor.   This latest bout of bloodletting over anti-Semitism stems from claims that the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism has not been accepted in full by Labour.  Wrong. It was actually accepted in 2016 and has now been replicated word for word in Labour’s code of conduct. And of the 11 working examples given by the IHRA of statements that could be seen as anti-Semitic, Labour has cut and pasted eight of them, and expanded on two-and-a-half of them. Only one half has not been accepted. That could have stopped people accusing the state of Israel of being racist.  But only last week the right-wing Israeli government narrowly passed an appalling Nation State Law that decreed Israel was a Jewish State, effectively making non-Jewish people second-class citizens. It has divided Israeli MPs. And the move, which many described as racist, was condemned around the world. Even the Board of Deputies of British Jews – who have heavily criticised Corbyn – agreed the move was “regressive” and have lodged concerns with the Israeli ambassador.

Get prepped before you go Before you set off, consider getting a Free Car Check at Halfords to put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too. Pembrey Sands, Wales  Located inside the Pembrey Country Park, this coastal highlight has eight miles of beach and something for everyone. Enjoy the sands in the morning and then head into the woodland for some shade in the afternoon. There are activities here, too, including cycling opportunities, a dry ski slope and an adventure playground. There’s also a campsite if you need a place to pitch your tent for the night. If you don\u0027t already have a tent and you\u0027re not sure where to start, check out the Halfords Tent Selector which will help you find the tent which best suits your needs.

There\u0027s loads of important nature here, with salt marshes, sand dunes and pine trees – originally planted to help protect the dunes.  Pack the Halfords Beach Hut 4 Pole Compact Windbreak (above), \u0026pound45 - it\u0027s perfect for carrying to the beach as it comes in a short carry bag with each pole in three sections ready the snap together. Kynance Cove, Cornwall  Kynance Cove isn’t the biggest beach that Cornwall has to offer, but the giant rocks that pepper the beach and caves worn into the rock by the turquoise sea make it well worth a visit. There are cliff walks all around the area, too.  A day on the beach, walking and exploring, can be thirsty work. The Halfords 40 Litre Mains and 12V \u0026amp 24V Electric Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (shown above) is easy to lug about thanks to durable wheels and a pull out handle.  The coolbox is able to cool up to 16 degrees C below the ambient temperature ensuring that your drinks and snacks are kept cool even on a warm day. It can be powered either from 240V mains or by a 12V in-car or 24v in-truck cigarette plug.  Durdle Door Beach, Dorset  The Jurassic Coast is a stretch of Dorset and Devon that has 185 million years of geological history. The first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton was found there my Mary Anning and her brother Joseph – she found the torso after he had found the skull a year previously. If your kids are into dinosaurs and natural history, this is the place to visit. Durdle Door Beach offers views of the famous limestone arch just off the coast. The beach itself is accessed by a fairly challenging set of stairs cut into the cliff, so bear in mind it won\u0027t be suitable for very young children or pushchairs. Consider Lulworth Cove instead, if you\u0027re worried about the tricky climb down. Whitby Beach and Sandsend, Yorkshire  A beautifully clean beach that\u0027s easily accessible for families. Walk around 2.5miles up Whitby Beach and it’ll become the slightly quieter Sandsend. There are lifeguards here in the peak season and the sand makes it ideal for little ones to paddle and explore. The promenade features colourful beach huts and gives a handy walkway if the tide is in. There are plenty of places to eat, too.  Whitby is also credited with giving Captain Cook his love of the sea, after he moved to the town to be an apprentice to coal shipping seaman John Walker. Take the Urban Escape Folding Chair (above) - now half price at \u0026pound20 and on offer at two for \u0026pound30 - which is perfect for relaxing in as the waves lap the shore. St Andrews West Sands, Scotland    Stunning views and Scotland\u0027s famous architecture are all on display around St Andrews and its beautiful beach. A ruined castle is nearby, to give you something else to explore if you want a break from games on the beach and the natural beauty of this amazing coastline. St Andrews is, of course, famous for being the home of golf. It also houses one of the UK\u0027s best universities. Famously, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met at St Andrews. Your beach walk may well have been one that the young couple enjoyed themselves as students.  Keeping food and drink cool at the beach in summer is a challenge. The Halfords Stripe Cool Bag (above) - now half price at \u0026pound7.50 - will help keep everything fresh until lunch. Mellon Udrigle, Scotland  Worth a visit for the name alone, Mellon Udrigle offers the advantages of the Scottish Highlands and might be a nice break from the summer heatwave. Temperatures in Mellon tend to be a lot lower than most of the UK, so it makes a lot of sense if you\u0027re more about dramatic beauty than sunning yourself.  Gentle dunes and grasses make a for a picturesque beach, but there are also rock pools which kids will adore. They might find crabs, starfish and all manner of other little beasts to inspect – just pop them back where you got them from! Keep your valuables dry with the OverBoard Waterproof Dry Pouch (above), from \u0026pound2.99. It\u0027s super durable and easily buckles onto your belt or bag loops, making it ideal for chilling on the beach.  Botany Bay, Kent  Something of a hidden gem, Botany Bay offers sandy beaches and plenty of exploring fun. The cliffs have smugglers’ caves cut into them, sealed up now, but worth a story or two about the days of covert contraband. Your kids will be fascinated and excited by things to see and do here. Wait for the tide to go out and you can all explore the rock pools, looking for creatures and cooling off their toes in the summer sun. Speaking of sun, you’d do well take some shade with you – particularly for the little ones in your beach party. The Halfords Infant Playshade (below), \u0026pound25, offers 50+ UV protection for children, while the Olpro Beach Hut, \u0026pound70, can keep the whole family covered on scorching days.    This picture-perfect beach is ideal for the kids to run around on. TripAdvisor named it the fourth-best beach in Europe (and the best in the UK), in 2015. The beach was used to train troops in landings during the Second World War, and you can find a memorial to the soldiers at the northern end of the beach. If you\u0027re a surfing family then Woolacombe Beach has great waves, thanks to the Atlantic Ocean – don\u0027t forget to pack your wetsuits! If you’re feeling less brave, pack a Nerf Mega Howler, \u0026pound12.50, for the beach. You’ll be amazed at how far it will fly, thanks to its aerodynamic design. Finger grips make it easy to throw and the noise will delight dogs and toddlers alike. After the beach… Salt water is no friend of the car, so make sure you wash it when you get home. Of course a summer hosepipe ban is likely this year, thanks to record temperatures, so you might want to consider a water-free solution.

Seeking to prevent more deaths after 114 people were killed in two massive forest blazes last year in Portugal, civil protection sent mobile text alerts warning the population of an extreme risk of fires in some regions, including around the capital Lisbon. In Greece, a wildfire killed 91 people last month.

In Lisbon, temperatures reached 43 degrees Celsius on Friday. The blaze began on Saturday in the hilly Monchique area of the southern Algarve region, popular with tourists. Authorities evacuated two villages in the area and 10 water-carrying aircraft were being used to fight the flames. Hot air from North Africa has caused the most severe heatwave in Iberia since 2003, one of the worst years on record for forest fires.12:27Not everyone keeping out of the sun todayAuthorities may be warning people to stay out of the sun in Portugal and Spain today, but that doesn\u0026#x2019t seem to be deterring everyone.Although some areas are said to be \u0026#x2018ghost towns\u0026#x2019 as the extreme heat takes its toll, pictures taken on La Barceloneta beach today suggest it\u0026#x2019s business as usual there.The heatwave is expected to last another couple of days, and forecasters say it could turn into the hottest day ever in Europe.Beaches are packed at La Barceloneta today (Image: REX/Shutterstock)Warnings for people to stay out of the sun haven\u0027t been heeded by everyone in Spain (Image: REX/Shutterstock)12:04Will it be the hottest day ever in Europe today?It could well be - or it could certainly come close.Forecasters are now expecting the extreme heatwave to challenge the 48C record.Portugal\u0026#x2019s highest ever recorded temperature prior to today is 47.4C, a record set in 2003.Neighbouring Spain\u0026#x2019s highest ever temperature is 46.9C, set last year in the southern city of Cordoba.11:13KEY EVENT\u0027Extreme risk\u0027 warning issued in SpainThis map shows how anxious forecasters are in Spain over today\u0026#x2019s heat blast - with several \u0026#x2018extreme risk\u0026#x2019 warnings in place.Weather agency AEMET published the map, which shows plenty of red and orange regions, particularly in the south west of the country.Emergency services are on standby, with extreme temperatures expected throughout the day.Weather warnings have been put in place in Spain11:02It was even above 30C at MIDNIGHT last night in SpainIt wasn\u0026#x2019t a comfortable night for people trying to sleep in Spain.The country\u0026#x2019s weather agency AEMET, revealed that even at midnight the temperatures were above 30C.AEMET tweeted this morning: \u0026#x201CAfter 45\u0026#xBAC on Friday in points of Andalusia and Extremadura, the night has been very warm: at midnight 32C and even 34C were exceeded in much of the southwest of the peninsula.

The Duchess of Sussex turns 37 on Saturday, and we\u0027re hoping Prince Harry is planning something special for the big day including the perfect present. But as a royal, Meghan is also likely to receive lots of other presents from fans and well-wishers around the world - and she\u0027s already been sent her first one. It\u0027s a lovely gift, and it\u0027s something that fits in perfectly with her beliefs and passions.  The animal rights organisation PETA has sent Meghan a \u0026pound290 handbag by designer Alexandra K . The bag is completely cruelty-free and made with vegan leather, and it even has a gold badge on the front which proudly states: This bad is animal cruelty free and vegan. Speaking to OK! magazine , PETA director Elisa Allen said: PETA believes this animal-friendly bag is absolutely perfect for the Duchess, as she is mostly vegan and cares about animals and the environment – in sharp contrast to the leather industry, which, in partnership with the meat trade, kills over 1 billion animals every year. Chances are that this gorgeous handbag will inspire the Duchess to embrace vegan fashion and leave all animal skins out of her wardrobe, as she\u0027s already done with fur.  PETA hopes the gift will encourage the royal family and its fans alike to embrace compassionate brands like Alexandra K and to steer clear of cruelly obtained animal skins. Unlike some of the other presents she\u0027ll be sent, Meghan should actually be allowed to keep this one. As a member of the royal family, there are all sorts of rules surrounding what gifts Meghan can accept. The general rule is that they\u0027re not allowed to accept gifts from people they don\u0027t know. Meghan Markle\u0027s rise to royalty in pictures - from starry-eyed child to Duchess of Sussex But as it\u0027s been sent by an organisation, she should be okay. The royal family\u0027s website states: The rules state: Gifts from public bodies Members of The Royal Family may accept gifts from government bodies, trade associations, guilds, civic bodies, the armed services, charities or similar organisations in the UK, especially those with which the Member of The Royal Family has an established connection, in the course of official engagements or to mark special personal occasions.    However, if the gift had been sent from the designer it would have been a different story. The website continues: Gifts offered by commercial enterprises in the UK should normally be declined, unless they are offered as a souvenir of an official visit to the enterprises\u0027 premises, to mark a Royal marriage or other special personal occasion. When gifts are accepted, the consent of the Member of The Royal Family should be contingent upon the enterprise undertaking not to exploit the gift for commercial purposes. Gifts, including samples, should always be returned unless it is not justifiable to do so on the grounds of cost. If such gifts are not returned, they should be treated as official gifts.

But the Duchess of Sussex still likes to indulge in refreshingly normal pastimes. Recently it was revealed that Meghan Markle and her new husband Prince Harry love to curl up and watch The Voice Kids on a Saturday night. And now it\u0027s come to light that there are certain foods she loves to eat on her birthday - and they\u0027re items most of us common folk enjoy every week.   Meghan Markle forced to give up her favourite food as the Queen bans it from Buckingham Palace menu  Meghan turns 37 today (August 4) and to mark the occasion it\u0027s likely she\u0027ll be indulging in two very specific things.  In an interview with Delish, the duchess, who is typically very health conscious, admitted that no matter where she is in the world, she loves to celebrate special occasions by eating chips and drinking a glass of wine.  This is a tradition she started keeping from a young age, having grown up eating canteen food at various Los Angeles TV studios, while her dad worked as a lighting director. She said: French fries and vino are my vices.  I\u0027m always hoping I\u0027m having lunch with people, so we can share fries. It\u0027s its own food group for me. Meghan added that she often chooses a big glass of red wine over dessert when she eats at a restaurant, but in the summer when she\u0027s out with friends, prefers to drink ros\u0026eacute all day. The duchess also has a particular love of of poutine - a mixture of chips, cheese and gravy which is especially popular in Canada, which was the main filming location for Suits. “It\u0027s got to squeak when you bite into it, she said of poutine.

Marking her first as a royal and her first as a married woman, the Duchess of Sussex has spoken of how she uses each annual milestone to reflect on her life and make a few wishes about her future.  The inspiration for her positive outlook is down to her deep love and appreciation for a woman that served as a role model and close friend, her mum. Meghan said her mother, Doria Ragland, instilled in her the values she has today and to always celebrate your birthday by doing something “just for yourself”. In an unearthed post from her now defunct blog The Tig, on her birthday in 2016, Meghan wrote: “My mom has always said that birthdays are your own personal New Year. “Your own chance to make resolutions just for yourself and what you prognosticate for your year ahead.  “More surprises, more adventure, more opportunities to grow, more days filled with giggles and cheeky jokes, more delicious meals, and more inspiration. “Always more inspiration.” She added: “I am feeling so incredibly joyful right now, so grateful and content that all I could wish for is more of the same.” The former actress was already dating Prince Harry when she penned the words, perhaps filled with confidence and excitement at her prospect of her future amid the blossoming relationship.    Sources close to the Markle family in the U.S. have told of their hope that Meghan’s birthday could prove to be a turning point in the much publicised breakdown of her relationship with her father, Thomas Markle. The family friend said Thomas was “fully expected to send Meghan a birthday card” to mark the occasion. They added: “I would be amazed if he didn’t, it would be the first time in his life he hadn’t done so and he always made a big deal out of her birthday’s when she was growing up. “Hopefully she will see it and it could prove to be the catalyst of her getting back in touch with him to put everything that has happened behind them and to rekindle the relationship they once had.”  Mr Markle this week told of how he wanted to send a card to his daughter, who he affectionately calls ‘Bean’, but was worried it would “just be one among thousands”. He said: It’s her birthday on August 4 and I want to send her a card. But if I send a birthday card to Kensington Palace, or wherever she’s living now, it’ll just be one among thousands. She’ll probably never see it. “I thought about sending it by Priority Mail Express, but the Palace would probably just soak it in water for three days to make sure it doesn’t explode.”  Meghan is believed to have refused to speak to her father for the past 10 weeks after he took part in a televised interview where he revealed Prince Harry’s views on President Trump and Brexit after phone conversations they had prior to the royal couple’s wedding.  Amid dealing with the public fallout, Meghan has thrown herself into getting to grips with royal life and her duty to the country she is now expected to fulfil. What Meghan Markle has worn since marrying Prince Harry - every outfit we\u0027ve seen on the Duchess of Sussex Keen to “hit the ground running”, Meghan undertook 17 royal duties before her nuptials and her first official post-wedding duty was just three days after the big day. She is yet to carry out her first solo engagement, but as a pair she and Harry have gone round the country and carried out a two day tour to Ireland this summer as well as her first outing with the Queen to Cheshire.  Meghan will continue her busy schedule when she accompanies Harry, 33, on their first major tour when they fly out to Australia, Fiji, the Kingdom of Tonga and New Zealand this autumn. Friends of the couple are understood to have teased the Prince over what gift he can get his new bride after he romantically whisked her away to Africa to celebrate her birthday last year, a year after they started dating.  But this year Meghan will be spending her special day in the small village of Churt in Surrey, at the wedding of Harry’s pals Charlie Van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks, where Harry is rumoured to be best man.  Harry and Charlie have been friends since they met at Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire as youngsters.

She\u0027s always showed thoughtfulness, grace and intelligence - from campaigning against a sexist ad when she was just 11 years old to the humanitarian work she\u0027s been passionate about long before she married Prince Harry. There\u0027s so much talk about the Duchess of Sussex every day, but what has she actually said about herself? As she celebrates her 37th birthday this weekend, here\u0027s what Meghan has said on some of the most important things in her life - in her own words.  On happiness and self-acceptance  On her 33rd birthday Meghan wrote on her website The Tig about the ways she struggled with the idea of fitting in - before she realised it\u0027s important to be kind and accept yourself as you are.   I am 33 years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.  My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as whatever as everyone else. My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant.       You need to know that you’re enough [is a] mantra that has now engrained itself so deeply within me that not a day goes by without hearing it chime in my head.  So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself. On her relationship with Harry  In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2016, Meghan spoke about her blossoming relationship with Prince Harry.  She said: We’re a couple... We’re in love. I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story. On the proposal Meghan Markle\u0027s rise to royalty in pictures - from starry-eyed child to Duchess of Sussex  In Meghan and Harry\u0027s first interview post-engagement, she told the BBC about how the proposal happened.  Just a cosy night. What were we doing? We were trying to roast a chicken. It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee. . . As a matter of fact, I could barely let [him] finish proposing, like, \u0027Can I say yes now?!\u0027 On feminism In her speech at the UN in 2015, Meghan told the story of her 11-year-old self who was angry at a sexist TV ad - and how she felt compelled to do something about it: I had been in school watching a TV show in elementary school and this commercial came on with the tag line for this dish washing liquid and the tag line said, ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’. Two boys from my class said, ‘Yeah, that’s where women belong, in the kitchen’. I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt it just wasn\u0027t right, and something needed to be done. So I went home and told my dad what had happened, and he encouraged me to write letters, so I did, to the most powerful people I could think of. It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision — because it isn\u0027t enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn\u0027t enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together. On her humanitarian work   In 2016, Meghan wrote on The Tig about how she feels she can\u0027t not do humanitarian work - particularly with the responsibility of someone in the entertainment industry who is looked up to.  I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works. And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.

Toni Mansfield was left in unbearable pain when her skin began to peel away during the inking process, and rushed to A\u0026ampE.  The 28-year-old, from Flint in North Wales, initially tried to take legal action against the parlour where the tattoo was done, the Daily Post reports.  But tattooists say the mum-of-three said an allergic reaction was likely to blame. Her hand had begun to swell during her second appointment at the Studio Thir13een parlour in Flint.  Ms Mansfield said she had tried to take legal action against the shop, but because she had signed a disclaimer before she had the work done, her solicitor advised her the case wasn’t likely to go anywhere. The parlour said it was not responsible for the tattoo going wrong, claiming she may have had an allergic reaction to the ink. But Ms Mansfield said when she had had the first session to get the outline done, there had been no problem. She added: “For the next appointment I put on some numbing cream to help with the pain. About an hour in to having it done my hand started to swell and my skin started to come away. “I started to feel really faint because the pain was so bad. I went to A\u0026ampE because the pain was unbearable and I couldn’t put my arm down without it throbbing.  “They told me I might end up needing a skin graft because it was so infected.” Ms Mansfield was put on a course of antibiotics to clear the infection. “I went back to complain and they gave me a refund.

Those heading to the seaside on England\u0027s south coast are likely to see the highest temperatures this weekend, as the mercury is predicted to peak at 31C (87.8F) over Saturday and Sunday.  The Met Office forecasts that stretches along the Hampshire and Dorset coast are most likely to be hottest on Saturday, while the mercury will soar on Sunday around London stretching north to the Midlands.    It is expected to get even hotter at the early next week, with highs of 32C (89.6F) possible around London on Monday and Tuesday, as the heatwave continues.   Britons making the most of the balmy weather were urged to stay sun sensible amid the high UV levels.   Dr Thomas Waite, a health protection consultant at Public Health England, said: To beat the heat, try to keep out the sun from 11am to 3pm, walk in the shade if you can, apply sunscreen and wear a hat if you have to go out in the heat. Also try to carry water with you when travelling. However, not all of the UK will be basking under clear blue skies. In Scotland and Northern Ireland clouds are likely with some thick enough to bring patchy rain to the north and west of Scotland.  The north-west, south-east split will continue early next week, with further showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland, while England and Wales stay generally dry and warmer. Temperatures will need to climb significantly if they are to come close to England\u0027s current August record - 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003.  However, the intense heat is likely to lessen come Wednesday, as conditions turn fresher and more changeable, the Met Office said. It comes amid an intense European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the sun most intensely.

Public Health England and the Met Office issued a level 2 heat warning for London, the South East and East Anglia. PHE’s Emer O’Connell said: “We’re advising people to look out for friends, family and neighbours who may feel the heat more than others. “People with heart and lung conditions, older people and young children can all struggle in warmer weather. “So our advice is look out for others, drink plenty of fluids and, if travelling anywhere, take water with you.”  Today (Saturday): It is set to be dry and fine for most, albeit western Scotland will have showers in the morning.

Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 40, has released a tell-all memoir about her tumultuous relationship with the legendary Apple founder who passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011. The book, titled Small Fry, reveals how Jobs initially denied paternity of his daughter but was forced by a judge to pay child-support after a DNA test proved that he had fathered Lisa during his five year on-off relationship with Chrisann Brennan during the 1970s. Lisa wrote in an excerpt published in Vanity Fair: “I was required to take a DNA test. The tests were new then, and when the results came back, they gave the odds that we were related as the highest the instruments could measure at the time: 94.4 percent. The court required my father to cover welfare back payments, child-support payments of $385 per month, which he increased to $500, and medical insurance until I was 18.”  Lisa, born in 1977, says she was forced to move home over 13 times before age seven as her mother struggled to pay the bills through a series of cleaning positions, while Jobs, then already a multi-millionaire, refused to help. “For him, I was a blot on a spectacular ascent,” she writes, “as our story did not fit with the narrative of greatness and virtue he might have wanted for himself. My existence ruined his streak.”  Lisa reveals how she regularly visited her father at his Tudor-style home in Palo Alto in the final 12 months of his life but said she was made to feel like a nuisance during her trips. “I’d given up on the possibility of a grand reconciliation, the kind in the movies, but I kept coming anyway”, she admitted.  During one particular meeting her father cruelly told her she smelled like a toilet after she had sprayed an expensive rose mist on her face in one of Job\u0027s bathrooms. “Before I said good-bye, I went to the bathroom to mist one more time,” she wrote. “The spray was natural, which meant that over the course of a few minutes it no longer smelled sharp like roses, but fetid and stinky like a swamp, although I didn’t realise it at the time.  “As I came into his room, he was getting into a standing position. I watched him gather both his legs in one arm, twist himself 90 degrees by pushing against the headboard with the other arm, and then use both arms to hoist his own legs over the edge of the bed and onto the floor. When we hugged, I could feel his vertebrae, his ribs. He smelled musty, like medicine sweat. “‘I’ll be back soon,’ I said. We detached, and I started walking away. “‘Lis?’” “‘Yeah?’” “‘You smell like a toilet.’”  During childhood, Lisa says her father began visiting her about once a month after he temporarily reconciled with her mother, bringing her roller-skating through the streets of her neigbourhood. During one visit she innocently asked if she could be given his Porche after learning the flashy vehicle had a scratch and need to be replaced. His scowling response shocked Lisa, then aged seven. “‘Absolutely not,’ he said in such a sour, biting way that I knew I’d made a mistake,” she remembers. “I understood that perhaps it wasn\u0027t true, the myth of the scratch: maybe he didn’t buy new ones. By that time I knew he was not generous with money, or food, or words the idea of the Porsches had seemed like one glorious exception.  “I wished I could take it back. We pulled up to the house and he turned off the engine. Before I made a move to get out he turned to face me. “‘You’re not getting anything,’” he said. “‘You understand? Nothing. You’re getting nothing.’ Did he mean about the car, something else, bigger? I didn’t know. His voice hurt—sharp, in my chest.” In later years, Lisa and her father grew to enjoy a respectful and sometimes caring relationship, thanks to the efforts of her biological aunt Mona Simpson.

I was just trying to have a good day and walk around the mall. When I left the house I felt beautiful and happy about myself, but having grown men attack me about what I\u0027m wearing when I\u0027m just trying to walk around and buy things was just so excessive. They didn\u0027t have to throw me out. Its a sad day when grown men can\u0027t control themselves. I just don\u0027t want anyone feeling like I did.  After the incident, she shared a photo of her outfit on social media. She wrote: I was literally harassed and kicked out of the [shopping centre] today because of what I\u0027m wearing.

The litter was discovered by a passing boater in Cross Lake, a remote town of Manitoba , around 500 kilometres north of Winnepeg.  Volunteers at the Norway House Animal Rescue are now looking after the pups, believed to be around four months old. Rescuers are mystified as to how the pups made their way to the tiny islet and have likened their adventure to that of 1960\u0027s sitcom Gilligan\u0027s Island. Volunteers from the rescue centre will now name the four-month-old pups after the cast of the TV series.   They will be the Gilligan\u0027s Island crew — four boys, three girls, Deb Vandekerkhove, told CBC News.  As we meet them, we will attach their names based on their personality — you know, who\u0027s the goof, who\u0027s the boss. According to Vandekerkhove, a local boater named Junior Cook heard the animals while boating in nearby waters. He assumed their cries were belonging to wolves and failed to spot them through his binoculars.  He actually heard them the night before. He and his friend were out and it was getting dark already, and they heard some noises on the island, she said. They took their binoculars and they couldn\u0027t see anything but some dark shadows, and they heard a bunch of crying. They thought originally it was wolves. Following day break, he returned to the island to discover the furry castaways living on the island alone.

Among the winning projects were improving Perth Road shopping area and footpaths in Baxter Park. More than 40% ofvotes cast came from the 11-25 age group.The report said it was “particularly striking” that more than three quarters of voters had not been involved in a community engagement exercise before.In conclusion, it said: “Overall, Dundee Decides has been an outstanding success and something that will hopefully serve as an inspiration to other local authority areas as they develop their programmes in future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b642080eb763-409x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united in safe hands for the rigours ahead says siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United fans will find out today which of their new goalkeepers has won the battle to start the league season between the sticks.And one of the men involved, Benjamin Siegrist, is happy to let them know in advance that whoever gets the nod, they can rest assured he’ll do a good job for the Tangerines.Whether or not it’s the giant Swiss shot stopper or Slovakian Matej Rakovan, Arabs are also safe in the knowledge they’ll keep each other on their toes all season.Since day one of pre-season training, Siegrist and Rakovan have been fighting hard to convince gaffer Csaba Laszlo they should be No 1 and that’s not going to stop with the visit of in-form Dunfermline.“You need to prepare every week to play,” said the 26-year-old former Aston Villa kid.“You train all week to play on Saturday, so, whatever you face, you know you have done the work during the week and you feel confident about facing it.“I want to play, that’s why I came here.

This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/5992cb2a231b1-e1533298876792.jpg ","title":"extra rail services between dundee and edinburgh for fringe festival","story":"\t\t\t\t\tExtra late night services and more carriages have been promised to get people to and from the Edinburgh Festival.With hundreds of thousands due to flock to the capital, services are expected be extremely busy and customers are being encouraged to plan their travel in advance.Fifers will benefit from an extra Edinburgh to Glenrothes train via Dunfermline on Fridays only from today to August 24, departing at 11.59pm and calling at all stations.There will also be an extra Edinburgh to Dundee train on Fridays and Saturdays until August 25, departing at 11.52pm and calling at all stations except Edinburgh Gateway and Springfield.

She is now studying towards her degree in business management at university in her spare time while working.She said: “If someone doubts me I try to prove them wrong.“I wasn’t too bothered about exam results because I just focused on getting a pass. Even if my friend got an A and I got a C, the fact I have passed is an achievement.”Throughout college, Melissa balanced working part-time and being a mum, saying: “I think the school system and social media adds to the pressure of it all.“You only see the people who get A grades on the news.“There are so many alternative pathways to get where you want if you don’t get the qualifications you need at school, for example apprenticeships and college.“There are always opportunities as you learn other skills on the job.”The campaign launch comes after Childline revealed it had held more than 1,000 counselling session for students worried about exams this year.The Childline centres in Aberdeen and Glasgow also dealt with more than 250 contacts – up by 28% compared to the previous year.Jayne Laidlaw, Childline manager for the Glasgow base, said: “Children and young people can feel incredible pressure during the exam period and this can turn to extreme anxiety around results time, especially if their marks don’t match up to their expectations or hopes.“They can often think these exams represent their last chance to make something of their lives, but this is not the case.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"only five players remain from when mccann took charge but dundee far from the finished article","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than a year into the job and with plenty of players in and out, Dundee boss Neil McCann is beginning to feel this squad is his own, though he admits they’re “far from the finished article”.Only five first-team players remain since Neil took the reins at Dens Park in June 2017 – Cammy Kerr, Darren O’Dea, Paul McGowan, Jesse Curran and Craig Wighton.After two summer windows – still four weeks to go in the current one – and a winter transfer period, it’s clear the Dens gaffer has put his own stamp on the side, though he admits he’s still got work to do on that front.He said: “The squad has evolved since I came in.“A lot of those boys that were here when I came in served me great.“When I’ve asked them to come in and do a job, they gave me everything but a lot of those boys have decided, when they’re not featuring regularly, they want to move on, and have.“I’m still looking to bring in some more but I’m pleased with the group I have just now.“You want to mould a team and how it wants to play and it has to be your team – there’s no point coming in and trying to use the previous manager’s ideas and ways he wants to play, it has to be your own.“I’m getting to the stage where I’m seeing things coming, but we need to bolt lots together because we’re far from the finished article.”Neil has been clear in his pursuit of further options at left-back and up front.Former Morton defender Mark Russell is in on trial along with former West Brom forward Adil Nabi.

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b641fc89a99f-e1533298226211.jpg ","title":"today

said: “The community has worked very hard for this and I was happy to facilitate meetings with officers and elected members throughout the process.“I know the multi-use games area will be a welcome addition to the local community and will encourage more children to enjoy the park, in safety.“The fantastic proposals are testament to the determination of the local community and council officers.”As part of the Dundee Decides initiative, which saw residents across the city decide how £1.2 million would be spent through the community infrastructure fund, extra lighting will also be installed along the pathways in the park.The Broughty Ferry ward voted to spend £25,000 of its budget allocation on lighting the paths.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “We’re committed to improving our parks, play equipment and providing new spaces for communities.“We invest hundreds of thousands of pounds every year to make that a reality and I’m pleased that we have been able to work on delivering the Gillies Park multi-use games area.“These are really exciting proposals that are important to making the Ferry look and feel more attractive, while also making Gillies Park safer by installing lighting around the park.”Over the last five years, Barnhill Tenants’ and Residents’ Association has been trying to improve Gillies Park.The group secured £70,000 of funding from the council’s neighbourhood services towards the multi-use games area.A sub-group made up of members of the association carried out door-to-door canvassing in the community to find out if residents would support the project.It started campaigning for the multi-use games area to be created two years ago and today welcomed the successful planning bid.Audrey Murphy, who was chairwoman of the association during the fundraising campaign, said: “We are very grateful for the support we received from Barnhill Primary School, local councillors, former councillor Laurie Bidwell and members of the sub-committee.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to

calling for a meeting take place this month at the Inverness Town House at which the public can be given a full update, with Highland Council officers and the building\u0027 owners present.\"It is time someone told us exactly what is happening,\" he said. \"It has been going on for more than five years. We keep being told something is going to happen but then nothing ever does.\"A planning application was lodged with the council earlier this year to remove scaffolding and demolish the remaining structure ahead of reconstruction. But hopes that work would start as early as June were dashed when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet about the proposal.Mr Crawford said he and other nearby traders had been kept mainly in the dark throughout the ongoing saga. He also wants the Inverness Common Good Fund to be used to acquire the building.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Central councillor Bet McAllister said she and her colleague Janet Campbell have attended meetings with council officials and the owners in a bid to resolve the situation.

We cannot keep having meetings and then nothing happens.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"We recognise the importance of that site. That is why we have ploughed significant support in kind to the owners and their agents to find a solution.\"We have to recognise this is a privately-owned building and the owners recognise their responsibilities.

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it. That can only be achieved by overhauling the current diffuse focus on individual planning applications in isolation.\"Now is the time to make that change. The forthcoming Planning (Scotland) Bill is the point of no return for Scotland\u0027 heritage.

project and would not give details on what the defects were.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said: “Some concrete panels are being replaced after a minor defect was identified as part of the rigorous quality control processes which are utilised across the project.“It is not unusual for minor defects to appear during the construction of major infrastructure projects. The contractor will undertake the necessary remedial works, at no extra cost to the taxpayer.“The AWPR/B-T project remains on schedule to open to traffic by late autumn 2018.”Labour MSP for the north-east region Lewis Macdonald said: “The most important thing is that Transport Scotland are able to be clear that the bridge is safe to use, and the road will be safe to open on schedule.“Clearly there has been some concern about the issue of the opening time, and I think that people will be keen to ensure that it is safe to use. It’s taken 15 years to get to this point and, people want it to be open without further delays.”The £745 million AWPR project has already suffered setbacks, including the collapse of Carillion, one of the construction partners on the bypass.It comes after outrage over months of possible disruption following the AWPR opening.Transport Scotland announced more than 30 restrictions that would be in place after the route’s opening.Temporary speed limits of 40mph and 50mph could last up to three months to prevent the road from being damaged.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"founder of north east bakery publishes biography","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe founder of a beloved north-east bakery has proved his baking prowess by publishing an autobiography.J George Ross, who founded JG Ross Bakery, has published his life story in a book called An Unlikely Lad.It tells of his journey from childhood to boss of one of the north-east’s best-loved institutions.The businesses started in 1962 when George and wife Betty bought a struggling bakery in Premnay.Since then the bakery has gone from strength to strength and it is now run with sons Graeme and Cameron at the helm.George said: “As the business grew there seemed to be a perception that my father had started the business and I was the second generation.“My immediate family and some of the grandchildren suggested I should set the record straight and write a book detailing the growth of the business from its inception, purely for future generations.\u0026#8220That is what I started doing a few years ago.”However, the buttery baron has now made his memoirs available to the public and even has plans to publish a second book.He said: “Following the book tour, I give a brief talk on the history of the company and a question and answer session.\u0026#8220A question often asked is about my life before starting in business.“This prompted me to start my book from my earliest memories, growing up in the village of Daviot, or ‘Davit’ as it was called.“This means of course that the book is bigger than I first planned, so I have decided it will have to be two books.\u0026#8220This first book will take you up to 1987.“I chose the title because I didn’t have a business background and although I always intended having my own business it may well have seemed unlikely to others“I never kept a diary so I am writing purely from memory.“It was never my ambition to be a baker but from an early age I had decided I wanted to be my own boss.“I was involved in the baking industry from an early age, purely by chance, so when the time came to set out on my own it made sense to stick to what I knew.”All proceeds from the book will go towards the JG Ross Foundation, which considers financial requests from local organisations.The books are now available to buy at Highclere and selected JG Ross shops.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"future midwives invited to university open day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA university in Aberdeen is to open its

proposal lodged","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group has put forward a formal request to purchase a former school building and turn it into a community hub.The Garioch Partnership is looking to take over the former Market Place Primary School in Inverurie – which has lain empty for nine months – and transform it into a community hub.The school has been empty since last October when pupils transferred to the new Uryside Primary School due to overcrowding.The group has made an asset transfer request to Aberdeenshire Council to purchase the building, which is still owned by the local authority.The former school was to be demolished and the space transformed into a car park.A notice of the request, which has been published publicly, stated: “The proposed use of the building is to develop it as a third sector hub, to enable community groups, local people and local small enterprises to have a common space to work together.”The public was invited to make representations into the plans up until yesterday.These will be considered by councillors at the end of this month.A statement, previously issued by the group when it launched a petition to gain support for the plan, read: “We’d like to provide Garioch with the space it deserves for communities to meet and come together – at affordable prices.“It’s called a third-sector hub but in simple terms it would be a place for groups – small and large – to come together, share space, interact with each other, learn together and laugh together.”The Garioch Partnership also hopes the plan will provide the opportunity to offer start-up space for some small businesses to use, right in the heart of the town.An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “We can confirm we have received a community asset transfer request from The Garioch Partnership to buy the former Inverurie Market Place School building to use as a community hub.“The next steps are for a report to be considered by the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday August 28.”The Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 introduces a right for community groups to make requests to all local authorities for any land or buildings they feel they could make better use of.The council has a responsibility to assess each request transparently against a specified list of criteria and agree to the request unless there are reasonable grounds for refusal.The school dates back to 1895 and housed evacuees during the Second World War.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors praise club staff after visit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff from a north-east out-of-school-club have been

east","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA course that has been hailed as a \u0026#8220life saver\u0026#8221 for motorcyclists is taking place in the north-east today.Police launched the rider refinement course in April to teach motorbikers tips and tricks on how to keep safe on the road.Twelve riders are completing the one-day course in Inverurie today, with help from the North East Police Division\u0026#8217s road policing unit.The course is part funded by Transport Scotland.The course is led by qualified police motorcyclists and take place throughout the summer.Road Policing Chief Inspector Stewart Mackie called the courses a \u0026#8220life saver\u0026#8221.He added: “Across Tayside, Grampian and Highland and Islands we benefit from some of the most beautiful scenery in the country, which attracts motorcyclists both near and far to visit our area and enjoy riding their bikes. #\u0026#8220However, it is both a sad and shocking fact that a significant number fatal collisions in the north area of the country involve motorcyclists.“With the onset of better weather, more motorcyclists will be out on the roads and we want to not only promote safe riding messages, but also encourage riders to think about their riding style and riding behaviour, and take advantage of the expert tuition and advice that we will be providing on our course.“The course is a one-day training event which we have specifically designed to give riders advice and tuition on how to ride more safely when out on the local road network.“Led by police motorcyclists, the course will look at key risk factors particular to the local area plus there will be demonstration rides and filmed rides with feedback from the officers afterwards.“The aim of the course is to develop the skills of the riders and improve their safety on the roads.\u0026#8220We also hope to encourage riders to use this as a stepping stone to other motorcycle training courses that are offered by partner organisations and private enterprises.“This is the only course of its kind being offered in Scotland at the moment and I hope that it will influence the behaviour of those who attend the course and help them to become safer riders.”Neil Greig, policy and research director of IAM Road Smart (formerly the Institute of Advanced Motorists) said: ”Skills development is key to safe motorcycling on Scotland’s challenging northerly routes.\u0026#8220Riders have a great deal of respect for highly trained police motorcyclists and are often keen to try and replicate their level of ability.\u0026#8220Such schemes are also one of the most popular entry points for riders seeking to enhance their skills by joining us at IAM RoadSmart and we are very happy to work with Police Scotland to offer riders that opportunity.\u0026#8221The next course takes place in Elgin on September 8 and costs £30 per person.Anyone interested in attending the course should

will have its world premiere at a prestigious film festival later this year.Stan \u0026amp Ollie is the third feature film from Peterhead’s Jon S Baird and tells the story of legendary comedy duo Laurel and Hardy.The film, which stars Steve Coogan and John C Reilly, will make its debut on October 21 at the closing-night gala of the 62nd BFI London Film Festival.Jon told The Evening Express: “I’m absolutely delighted that Stan \u0026amp Ollie will be closing the London Film Festival.“It’s a real honour for me to be having the world premiere in a city that’s so close to my heart, as I know it was to Laurel \u0026amp Hardy also.“I can’t wait for people in the north-east to see it in January as they have always been very supportive of my films, which I’m extremely grateful for.”The film follows the Hollywood comics as they travel around the UK and Ireland on their “farewell” tour in 1953.Laurel, played by Coogan, and Hardy, played by Reilly, have to deal with initially disappointing attendances and Hardy’s failing health.The problems threaten to overwhelm their partnership as the two men attempt to reconnect with each other, in addition to their fans.Co-starring Shirley Henderson and Nina Arianda as the duo’s wives Lucille and Ida, Stan \u0026amp Ollie was written by Jeff Pope, who was nominated for an Oscar alongside Steve Coogan for 2013’s Philomena.The BFI London Film Festival’s artistic director Tricia Tuttle said: “We’re delighted to be closing the BFI London Film Festival with this beautiful tribute to cinema’s early comedy odd couple, Laurel and Hardy.“A truly funny and touching story about a tender life-long friendship, Jon Baird’s film is also a must for movie fans, exploring the twilight years of two megawatt performers who had a meteoric rise to fame.“These two prove that true comic timing is eternal, and it’s a perfect end to the festival.”Jon grew up in Peterhead and attended Meethill Primary, as well as Peterhead Academy.After he graduated from university in Aberdeen he immediately moved down to London to break into the movie business.He has previously received acclaim for his 2013 adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel Filth and in 2015

I fear this is only the beginning.”Isla McGlade, interim associate nurse director for mental health and learning disability services, said 22 newly qualified nurses will join the hospital in October.She added: “While this is an enormous boost, these new recruits will need support as they settle into their first job after graduation.“In the short term we are working with nursing agencies to recruit appropriately trained staff as soon as possible to cover from now until the newly qualified nurses are settled.“However, this still leaves us with more than 30 vacancies.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinnes confident he has squad supporters can be excited about","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons boss Derek McInnes today insisted he will keep trying to strengthen his squad – but reckons he already has a team that can deliver success.The Reds face Rangers at Pittodrie tomorrow in their first Premiership game, just days after crashing out of Europe.Following the 3-1 loss to Burnley at Turf Moor, McInnes admitted there was “raw disappointment” among his squad.However, he has warned there can be no European hangover when they kick-start the domestic campaign against Steven Gerrard’s Rangers.McInnes had hoped to have a new striker on board ahead of the Rangers clash but is confident his squad can still do a job tomorrow, and reckons the Battle of Britain has given the Red Army a taster of what is ahead this season.He said: “Our supporters applauded the team to a man for their efforts at Burnley but I think there was also a tinge of excitement for what is ahead.\u0026#8220We have gave our supporters a little hint and flavour of what we expect from the team this year.”McInnes has secured six new signings this season: Lewis Ferguson, Stephen Gleeson, Tommie Hoban, Chris Forrester, Dominic Ball and Tomas Cerny.The only transfer fee paid out was £200,000 to Peterbrough for Forrester. However, the development fee the Dons will have to pay Hamilton for Turf Moor goal hero Ferguson will be decided by an SPFL tribunal on August 21.In contrast, Rangers have splashed in excess of £5 million this summer in a bid to overtake the Reds, who finished Premiership runners-up.McInnes reckons this has prompted many pundits to predict the Ibrox club will overtake them in Scotland’s pecking order – especially in light of the Glasgow outfit’s dealings in the transfer market.He has other ideas.McInnes said: “If you listen to what everyone else is saying, that we are going to be this and that and we are going to finish here in the league and we need this player or we need that player.“However, there is enough here, in personality and confidence, within that team to suggest to me that we are going to have a good season.“We will try to bring good reinforcements in but the squad is strong and we aim to show that this season.”There is no better arena to show that in than a season opener against Rangers.Ultimately, it is just three points – the season will not be defined by this game – but a win could certainly represent an early marker and statement of intent.Last season Aberdeen took just one point from 12 against a Rangers side beset by problems behind the scenes.“When you saw the ovation from the supporters at the end (of the Burnley tie), it was not just in recognition of the players’ efforts and quality of performance,” he said.“It was also that they see, something in this squad they can be excited about for the season ahead.“And there is no better game to try to get off (to a good start) and feel better about ourselves than by winning against Rangers.“That will be tough but it is a brilliant game to be involved in and may be just the perfect game after the disappointment of losing to Burnley.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mckenna good enough to star in england","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSkipper Graeme Shinnie has no doubt wanted man Scott McKenna could cut it not just in the Championship but the English top flight – although he hopes the defender stays at Pittodrie.Swansea have already approached Aberdeen to inquire about the availability of the 21-year-old centre-back.The Championship outfit are lining up a £2 million bid for the Scotland international before the transfer window closes in England on August 9.McKenna will face Rangers in the Premiership opener at Pittodrie tomorrow as the Reds aim to bounce back from their Euro exit.Aberdeen suffered massive disappointment when losing 3-1 after extra-time to Burnley at Turf Moor to exit the Europa League 4-2 on aggregate.Shinnie reckons the way McKenna shackled the Clarets big-money strikers, including £15m signing Chris Wood, proves he can hack it in England’s top flight.He only hopes that move comes a long way down the line and that tomorrow’s clash with Rangers at Pittodrie is not McKenna’s last for the Reds.Shinnie said: “Scott McKenna and Mikey Devlin were brilliant again in what was a tough task with the physicality of the two Burnley boys up front.\u0026#8220But they dealt with it brilliantly and that gave us the platform in the game.“Scott could go to a Premier League team (in the future), as he showed what he can do against a Premier League team in Burnley.“However, he is a level-headed guy as well and wants to rack up as many games as he can, which is really positive for a young player.\u0026#8220He wants to get the experience and wants to get the games.“There is no doubt he will probably end up going at some point but we will hold on to him as long as we can.”Aberdeen rejected an offer in excess of £1 million from Hull City for Scotland cap McKenna during the January transfer window. Since then he has made his international breakthrough and captained Scotland in a 1-0 summer friendly loss to Mexico.McKenna will be at the heart of the defence in a game against Rangers that marks new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard’s first domestic game.After the disappointment of losing at Turf Moor, skipper Shinnie challenged the Reds to bounce back with a victory.He said: “Pittodrie will be packed for Rangers and it is a good game to have off the back of the Euro tie.“We need to put that (loss to Burnley) at the back of our minds.“It is a massive game but that is what it is like at Aberdeen – big games come thick and fast.“We know the crowd will be there in their numbers so it is another game where we have to step it up.”Aberdeen were up against a side with an immensely superior budget in Burnley, who have a £37m players’ wage budget.Tomorrow the figures may be smaller but there is still a gulf between the budget of Rangers and that of Aberdeen.The Ibrox club have backed Gerrard’s rebuilding by sanctioning transfers in excess of £5m during the summer.There have also been high-profile loan deals that will require high wages.Shinnie does not care about the cash the Ibrox club are splashing out, though.On the disparity between the two club’s budgets, he said: “That is out of our control and we just focus on ourselves.“The games against Burnley have been positive for us and we look to take that momentum into the league.”Aberdeen may have been knocked out of Europe but Shinnie reckons they regained some pride for Scottish football.It is a tie he believes the Dons deserved to win over the two legs to book a third qualifying round clash against Istanbul Basaksehir of Turkey.He said: “In Scotland teams know what we are all about – we have proved that over the last couple of years.“Maybe we have now shown people down in England what Scottish football is all about.“It is not as bad as what the English make it out to be.“But in Scotland, in terms of us, we have shown what we are all about.“We have got a big season ahead of us again to show that.”Aberdeen may have been underdogs against Premier League Burnley but, make no mistake, there was a belief in this squad they could progress.It was this confidence which made losing out in extra time all the more difficult to take for the Aberdonian, particularly as the Reds had opportunities to win the tie.He said: “We are gutted that we did not get through because that is what we wanted and what we set out to achieve.“No matter who it was against, we wanted to get through and we had the opportunities to do that.“It is disappointing but we will take the positives.“We can be proud of what we did… but it wasn’t good enough.“At the start of the game Burnley were good, although we didn’t start great in the first half.“Once we got to grips with the game, we got right into it.“In the second half, again, we didn’t start overly great but went on to be the better team and create the better chances.I thought, over the two legs, we were probably the better team but we didn’t take our chances and, in the end, that kills you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

competition.The winners successfully pitched for a chance to win a free trade stand within the craft tent at the festival, a popular pit stop for those keen to snap up unique designs.With more than five thousand visitors descending on Inveraray Castle for the festival, the six businesses have a fantastic opportunity to raise their profile and sell their products.Now in its fifth year, the Business Gateway Argyll and Bute competition asked business owners to share with the panel of judges why their venture is special and why their products would be a good fit for the festival.The successful businesses who will showcase their products in the Business Gateway sponsored craft tent this year are Keltic Faerie, Janice Bracey Designs, Slate Island Seaweed, Alison McIntosh Prentice, Daisy Rocks Design and Cardross Crab Art.Alison McIntosh Prentice, based in Helensburgh, is an artist who cites the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret as her biggest influence.Using her worldwide travels as inspiration for her art, Alison has a background in graphic and multimedia design but through the years painted as a hobby.Mainly self-taught, Alison now focuses on her art full-time and has exhibited in Barcelona, Wales and Glasgow.Using colours and textures she admired while travelling, Alison’s paintings will be on display and available to buy at a stand within the craft tent at the Best of the West festival.Alison said: \u0026#8216I’ve been attracted to the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret for over 30 years and have further investigated the techniques they used in Gesso artworks which now make up the majority of my work.\u0026#8216The stand at the Best of the West festival will allow me to showcase my art and hopefully sell to those attending.\u0026#8216It’s particularly good timing as I’ve put my travel adventures behind me for now and I’m focusing on being in Scotland and producing the best artwork I

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The Honest Men kick off their Championship campaign at home to Partick Thistle on Saturday - the side they put to the sword last week to top their Betfred Cup group. And McCall, who is unfurling a title flag for the first time as a manager, hopes the fans can turn out for the occasion. He said: “We are all very much looking forward to the game on Saturday, where we will get the flag. “I am hoping for at least 3000 of our own fans there to make a hell of an atmosphere. “I think all the fans who missed the last game of the season will maybe want to come to this one. “Plenty would have thought we had blown the league, and they weren’t alone in thinking that - I thought we had blown it. “But we want to get off to a flyer and the fans can help.”  United will play Dundee at Dens Park in the last 16 of the Betfred League Cup on Saturday, August 18. For the second year in a row the Honest Men have topped the group with maximum points and still ended up with tough Premiership opposition away from home. McCall said: “The team that we beat in the group gets Celtic at home and we get Dundee away. “It’s just the luck of the draw. “But the way we are playing we will go up there and give it a go. McCall added: “We won the group convincingly, which was positive going into the new season.  “People seem to forget that it’s the second biggest cup in Scotland. “For a club like us to be a seeded team two years in a row is just exceptional. “I think our fans have bought into it too, as there was over 700 fans there at Firhill which was amazing.” Lawrence Shankland scored a stunning 35 yard lob to make it 37 goals from 37 games. McCall said: “He is very happy here so I think it would take a hell of an offer for him to leave.” Ross Docherty, who was on the bench against Partick, is expected to be in the squad on Saturay. Mark Kerr will be suspended due to bookings from last season carrying over. Chris Higgins is still sidelined, and Craig Moore and Andy Geggan will be assessed closer to game time.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland.

Dalmilling Golf Club in Ayr is now planning to honour Glenn Wilson’s awesome achievement. He scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par. That equalled Sean Ryan’s round seven years ago and Glenn said: “I thought I was playing well, but not this well. “I love golf and cannot get enough of it.” He bagged an ace during the July Saturday Bowl at the lucky-for-him 13th. Yet at the second hole he scored a potentially card-wrecking double bogey 6. Glenn said: “My drive at the second landed in a divot and I ended up catching it thin and going into the bushes at the back.” He got hooked on golf six years ago when he picked up an old club and started hitting balls in the field near his home in Dalmilling. Three years ago he joined Dalmilling as a member and has played most days since then. His handicap has gradually gone down from 19 to the present six. That meant his score in the July Bowl was a net 55, blowing any opposition out of the water. His inward nine was just 28 strikes. Club secretary Tommy Swan says everyone is very proud of their “superstar.” He added: “This is an outstanding achievement, a magnificent score for a 15-year-old. “I’d say it was even more special because he double-bogied the second hole. “That would have wrecked most players, but Glenn stuck at it. “He started out at Dalmilling with only a few clubs, but has gradually built a set. And he is so keen on the game that he also volunteers to help the green-keeping staff on a regular basis. “We are planning something in his honour.” Glenn, of Thorneyflat Street, is in his fourth year at Ayr Academy and is cheered on by his three sisters and one brother. Parents Linda and Glenn are suitably proud of their starlet.  He is keen to make golf  his living and already represents his club in Ayrshire Golf Association competitions.  The next step would be to try for the Ayrshire Boys team. At the moment he is volunteering with the greenkeeping staff as part of his Duke of Edinburgh bronze award. And he casually admits that the hole in one was not his first, but his THIRD.  Most golfers don’t get one in their entire playing days and Glenn said: “I play  every day and I love Dalmilling.   “This was my first hole  in one during a competition.  “But I have just had two others, both at the eighth at Dalmilling, with my pal Adam Cambers and my uncle John Strachan.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsEdinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"group-is-chuffed-with-plans-for-railway-museum","story":"THE wheels are in motion to honour Peebles\u0026rsquo historic railway by creating a museum in the town.\nIn recognition of the prosperity the railway brought to the community, members of the Peebles Community Trust (PCT) are hoping to transform the former weigh bridge, located in Edinburgh Road car park, to house the railway archive dating back to 1855.\nThe development of Peebles owes a great deal to the railway, which made its final stop in 1962. During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact PCT co-coordinator Alex Wilson at admin@peeblescommunity.org\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

Michael Russell is lukewarm about a scheme for a further salmon farm near Carradale.Norwegian company, Marine Harvest Scotland (MHS) which runs the largest salmon farm in Europe wants to increase its size by nearly a third.Last week an application to the Scottish Enviromental Protection Agency(SEPA) from Marine Harvest Scotland (MHS), is seeking approval for a Controlled Activities Regulations licence.Mr Russell said: \u0026#8216I wasn’t aware of this development and am disappointed that there has been so little local consultation about the proposal.\u0026#8216Whilst I am supportive of aquaculture in general there needs to be community involvement in all such proposals.\u0026#8216I hope the company will now engage with the population and local elected representatives, giving information on why they think further growth is necessary and what alternatives they have considered.\u0026#8216That will allow some informed debate about the companies intentions and permit a community view to be formulated.\u0026#8217The new site seeks to contain a maximum biomass of 2,475 tonnes of farmed salmon, which will be held in 12 pens of 120m in circumference.The salmon will be fed with an automated feed barge, and the discharge will be disposed into the Kilbrannan Sound, 11km north of Carradale.If it is successful, the company will have grown by a third in the area, due to already having two existing fish farms in Carradale.In the application, MHS has stated that its planned maximum production per year is to be 3,611 tonnes of salmon.The application also inquires the approval of bath medicines, Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin and Azamethipos.These chemicals are used to control salmon parasites on fish farms such as sea lice.Argyll and Bute MP, Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara added: \u0026#8216Aquaculture is a major success in Argyll and Bute and it’s because of the quality of the product they supply.\u0026#8216I’m not a consultee in planning matters but I would want to

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.  Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee-shop-opens-at-historic-tolbooth-in-musselburgh","story":"  Mr Martin, who lives in Musselburgh and played Eric in the show, was invited to officially open The Coffee Gallery in the historic Tolbooth at the Old Town Hall, leased from East Lothian Council.

The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council (ABC) councillors had voted to fly the flag at the weekend, to coincide with Pride Day, but DUP members triggered a procedural mechanism on Tuesday claiming that proper process had not been followed.  The \u0026ldquocall-in mechanism, which needs the backing of 15% of councillors, requires officials to seek legal advice on a course of action before proceeding.  Mrs Foster told BBC Radio Ulster: \u0026ldquoAs I understand it, the issue is not about Pride, the issue is about that the policy in the ABC council is only to fly the Union flag and the Armed Forces Day flag, and colleagues felt this was a ruse by republicans to remove our national flag, and it\u0026rsquos not about respect or Pride at all.  \u0026ldquoWe should have respect for each other but not if it\u0026rsquos going to be used as a ruse to take down the national flag.  The move was labelled \u0026ldquobizarre by Sinn Fein.  Meanwhile, a group of around 50 Christian anti-Pride campaigners gathered at Belfast City Hall to protest against the event, reading Bible verses and singing hymns.  The Pride Festival is now one of the biggest events in Belfast and it has involved more than 100 events across 10 days."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8104502.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-2018-european-championships-springs-to-life-with-festival-of-sport","story":"  The inaugural day of sport saw qualifying rounds take place in track cycling at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, women\u0026rsquos artistic gymnastics at the SSE Hydro and rowing at Strathclyde Country Park.

Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager costs were \u0026pound3,488 in 2015 and \u0026pound2,400 in 2017, however his official candidate return did not mention the SUAT partly bankrolled the posts.  The SUAT, which has given the Tories \u0026pound319,000 since 2001 but does not publish accounts, is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission over its status as a donor.  It was only last month, after the SNP challenged Theresa May over the SUAT at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, that the shadowy outfit first named its trustees.  The SNP last demanded full transparency from the Scottish Secretary on the issue.  The money trail from the SUAT to Mr Mundell emerged yesterday when the Electoral Commission published the accounts of hundreds of small party branches across the UK.  These included the Scottish Borders Conservative \u0026amp Unionist Association (SBCUA), which covers the Tweeddale part of Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale \u0026amp Tweeddale seat.  The accounts for 2017 said the SBCUA had a paid campaign manager overseeing a series of elections, including Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos general election fight.  \u0026ldquoThe Association is very grateful to the Scottish Unionist Association Trust for providing 50% of the funds for this crucial campaigning position throughout 2017, with the Association itself being responsible for the balance, it said.  However there is no public record of the SUAT donating directly to the SBCUA in 2017.  Other SBCUA accounts showed the SUAT also part-funded a campaign manager for Mr Mundell in 2014 and 2015 in the long build-up to the 2015 election.  The cost split was not given, but official election invoices listed the campaign manager costs as \u0026ldquo103 days @ 50% and \u0026ldquo38 days @ 50%.  The SUAT gave the SBCUA at least \u0026pound12,336 in 2014 and \u0026pound6,168 in 2015.  The SUAT and SBCUA also jointly funded a campaign manager for Tory MP John Lamont in Berwickshire, Roxburgh \u0026amp Selkirk in 2015 and 2017.  During the 2015 election, the chair and treasurer of the SBCUA was former Merrill Lynch consultant Robert Miller-Bakewell, the chair of the SUAT.  He was also deputy chair and deputy treasurer of the SBCUA at the 2017 election.  Mr Mundell has denied getting cash from the SUAT, but has not denied campaign help.  However he was cagey about the issue when quizzed on BBC Radio Scotland last month.  He said: \u0026ldquoI personally have not received cash because we go through a process of funding associations and I am confident that over the full period during which I have been involved in politics, all donations I have received from any source have been appropriately declared.  Asked him much money his campaign had received, he said: \u0026ldquoThat is a question that can be sourced from all the declarations.  SNP MSP George Adam said: \u0026ldquoThe Tory dark money scandal is a running embarrassment for the party, and they\u0027re doing themselves no favours in trying to hide from scrutiny.  \"David Mundell has repeatedly tried to deny his links to the Scottish Unionist Association Trust. Now it seems they helped bankroll his election campaign.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re talking about one of the most senior Tories in Scotland here. He should be open and honest over where this money came from.  \u0026ldquoTransparency over party finances is absolutely essential in any healthy democracy. The public have the right to know who helped put their politicians into office.\"  The Electoral Commission yesterday said it would not be investigating a \u0026lsquodark money\u0026rsquo row involving the DUP, a former Scottish Tory, and the EU referendum.  A BBC Northern Ireland TV programme alleged the DUP may have worked improperly alongside other pro-Brexit campaigners.  The DUP accepted \u0026pound435,000 from the Constitutional Research Council, chaired by former Scots Tory candidate Richard Cook, on the eve of the referendum, which was then spent on newspaper ads in the UK.  The Commission said it did not have grounds to open an investigation into the allegations.  However it also urged the UK government to bring forward legislation allowing it to disclose details of past donations to Northern Ireland parties, which are currently kept secret.  Mr Mundell is currently on a UK Government trip to New Zealand.  The Scottish Conservatives said all SUAT donations to the party and all election spending had been properly and fully reported to the Electoral Commission in line with the law.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe money donated from the SUAT comes from the proceeds of the sale of Scottish Conservative properties in Scotland in the 1960s.  \u0026ldquoSince then, the SUAT has used those funds to promote the interests of the party.  \"These publicly registered documents show that the SUAT has helped fund a campaign manager for the SBCUA in recent years, as it has supported other Associations across Scotland. In 2017, this amounted to 50 per cent of the cost of the campaign manager.\""},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-army-on-the-streets-dreams-of-better-times-on-hold-in-zimbabwe","story":"  The young mother had brought her six-month old daughter Keisha to a maternity clinic in the heart of Mbare, the biggest and oldest township in the Zimbabwean capital Harare.  With its rundown, high-density housing and bustling informal street markets and vendors, Mbare stands in part as testimony to the slump in Zimbabawe\u0026rsquos formal economy under the near 40-year autocratic rule of former President Robert Mugabe.  Mbare is a tough place to live, with unemployment and poverty rife.  Zimbabweans, ever the eternal optimists, joke that in Mbare you can buy anything, including the parts they stole from your car the night before.  Joy Mviro though was convinced that hope for the future had finally arrived. Along with most Zimbabweans she welcomed the new mood that had followed the ousting of Mr Mugabe.  \u0026ldquoWe can now talk openly, she told me. \u0026ldquoBefore Mr Mugabe was kicked out, I would have thought twice about talking to a journalist but not now, the twenty-one year old explained.  Almost every Zimbabwean I met during my visit a few months ago shared the young mother\u0026rsquos eager anticipation over the forthcoming elections. They were convinced that the ballot would bring change for the better to this long-suffering African nation.  This week Zimbabweans finally had their long awaited election, but it was one marred by the deaths of six people in an army crackdown on opposition protests.  \u0026ldquoThe government still has a military core and a military ethos, was how Zimbabwe expert Stephen Chan, of London University\u0026rsquos School of Oriental and African Studies, summed up the situation.  \u0026ldquoHow can you be so goddamn clumsy? You\u0026rsquove gone to all this trouble to stage-manage this stuff and you\u0026rsquove just gone and shot yourself in the foot, Mr Chan wryly observed.  He has a point, not least given that what again has become clear in the election\u0026rsquos aftermath, is the continuing extent of the deep rifts in Zimbabwean society and the instinctive heavy-handedness of the country\u0026rsquos security forces.  Ultimately after two days of bitter claims and counterclaims, incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old former spy chief, nicknamed \u0026lsquothe crocodile,\u0026rsquo secured a comfortable victory for his Zanu-PF party, polling 2.46 million votes against 2.15 million for 40-year-old opposition leader Nelson Chamisa of the MDC Alliance.  Time and again in the run up to the elections, I listened to government officials repeat the political mantra that Zimbabwe was now \u0026ldquoopen for business.  The bad old days of authoritarian rule they insisted were now behind the country.  Yesterday on the streets of Harare however it was police officers in vehicles with mounted loudspeakers that toured the city\u0026rsquos streets reassuring shopkeepers.  \u0026ldquoZimbabwe is open for business. We are here to protect you. Feel free to walk and open your business. All is well, fear not, the officers insisted.  Some election observers say that the army\u0026rsquos deployment on Harare\u0026rsquos streets and the repression used has shot a hole in the government\u0026rsquos claims that Zimbabwe has thrown off its authoritarian past.  Mr Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos government is nothing more than a military junta in disguise some claim, pointing to Constantino Chiwenga, leader of last November\u0026rsquos coup that ended Mr Mugabe\u0026rsquos rule as the man really in charge.  \u0026ldquoThis has blown the slogan \u0026lsquoOpen for Business\u0026rsquo into smoke, Ibbo Mandaza, a political analyst and a former member of the ruling Zanu-PF, told the Financial Times this week.  \u0026ldquoThe consensus now is that engagement with the west is a very far-off prospect, he said, citing discussions with foreign observers and diplomats shocked at the violent turn the elections had taken.  If this proves to be true then President Mnangagwa and his Zanu-PF party for the moment have little to celebrate. Indeed even before this week\u0026rsquos poll there have been rumours of splits and factionalism in the government\u0026rsquos ranks ever since a bomb went off during the election campaign in an apparent attempt to assassinate Mr Mnangagwa.  As for opposition leader Mr Chamisa, his premature claims of victory and inflammatory talk before the election results were fully collated, only served to fuel more uncertainty and fears over a lack of transparency in the ballot.  Zimbabwe\u0027s constitution does allow for a legal challenge to the results, but Mr Chamisa now has the huge task of proving in court with hard evidence what until now have only been claims and accusations.  Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos internal problems aside, the whole notion of the country being \u0026ldquoopen for business has been given a major setback by the way the elections were conducted and will only suffer more if unrest rears its head again.  Earlier this year in Harare, the European Union\u0026rsquos Commissioner for International Development, Neven Mimica, signed an agreement with Zimbabwean officials that saw new EU-funded programmes worth \u0026pound20 million launched to improve people\u0026rsquos access to health services and enhance their livelihoods.  I asked Mr Mimica at the time whether such future funding might be reconsidered should Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos election fail to be free and transparent and any future administration not live up to the democratic terms laid down as conditions.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has always been a reliable partner of the Zimbabwean people, and it stands ready to accompany Zimbabwe in its process of change, said Mr Mimica  \u0026ldquoWe do not want to be a passive partner in this process, he added, stressing that the EU and others were watching Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos forthcoming elections carefully and that reforms must be made and checks carried out that such a process is underway for EU financial support to be maintained. His words have now taken on a new resonance.  This was an election on which much was riding. It was supposed to confirm the legitimacy of the post-Mugabe government and allow Harare to renew ties with the international community.  Whether now the unlocking of donor funding and investment will continue as envisaged before the poll remains to be seen, but the international community is almost certain to be wary."},{"url":null,"title":"i-had-more-or-less-given-up-blind-man-recounts-clifftops-ordeal-on-iona","story":"  Laying at the foot of a 30ft cliff edge, the then 48-year-old strained every muscle to haul his crumpled body up to higher sands in a bid to avoid drowning in the incoming tide.  \"I didn\u0027t feel the physical pain at first.

It was raining continuously.  \"At that point I was resigned to the fact that I was on my own, and had more or less given up.\"  It was after five hours, and after crawling what he thinks was around 70 metres, he was spied by an American tourist, who at first thought he was a crumpled up backpack. He was then airlifted to hospital  Had he remained were he originally fell, he said he wouldn\u0027t have been seen.  \"I was with my friend on Iona.

It comes amid ongoing concerns that Scotland is lagging behind England when it comes to actual superfast broadband speeds.  Just over a week ago Westminster\u0026rsquos Scottish Affairs committee called on the UK and Scottish Governments to work together following political squabbling over the roll-out of broadband north of the Border.    For the last three months, home broadband providers have had to ensure that at least 50% of their customers can achieve advertised speeds at peak time.  The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) began to enforce the tougher standard \u0026ndash that speed claims should available to at least half of customers between 8pm and 10pm and described in ads as \u0026ldquoaverage \u0026ndash from May.  Acccording to Which? BT, EE, John Lewis Broadband, Plusnet, Sky, Zen Internet, Post Office, SSE, TalkTalk and Utility Warehouse previously advertised their standard (ADSL) broadband deals as \u0026lsquoup to 17Mbps\u0026rsquo. The new advertised speed is now more than a third lower at 10Mbps or 11Mbps.    Previously, suppliers were able to advertise broadband deals which claimed \u0026lsquoup-to\u0026rsquo speeds that only one in 10 customers would ever reach.  But the new advertising rules mean that at least half of customers must now be able to get an advertised average speed, even during peak times (8-10pm).  Which? found that across all the deals on offer from the 12 biggest providers, the advertised speeds from \u0026lsquoup to 17Mbps\u0026rsquo to \u0026lsquoup to 100 Mbps\u0026rsquo had dropped by an average of 15%.  TalkTalk has completely dropped advertising speed claims from most of its deals. Vodafone has also changed the name of some of its deals: Fibre 38 and Fibre 76 are now Superfast 1 and Superfast 2.    Only advertised speeds by Virgin Media, which is the only provider that can give gold standard fibre-to-the-router superfast broadband, have gone up since the change.  Before the new rules came into effect, Which? found evidence that British households were paying for broadband services that were on average 51% slower than advertised.  Which? has called for guidelines over advertised speeds since 2013 through its Broadband Speed Guaranteed campaign.  Alex Neill of Which? said: \u0026ldquoCustomers will now have a much clearer idea of the speeds that can be achieved when they are shopping around for broadband.  \u0026ldquoFor those still struggling to get a reasonable speed or connection, the Government must press ahead with its crucial plans to deliver the service that broadband customers need, without it costing them the earth.  CAP toughened up the standards following research which found they were likely to mislead consumers.  The study, commissioned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), found most consumers thought they were likely to receive a speed at or close to a provider\u0026rsquos headline claim when, for many, that was not the case.  Previous independent testing by consumer groups found that up to three quarters of households were paying for advertised broadband speeds they never received."},{"url":null,"title":"want-to-pass-a-driving-test-try-golspie-says-survey","story":"  Data from the DVSA found that 57.4% of learners in Scotland passed their practical test in 2017/18 \u0026ndash the highest pass rate anywhere in the UK.

The driver savings site has created an interactive calendar using DVSA data from the past five years to help learners identify the best dates of the year to sit their test.

The US car manufacturer revealed its plans to take some of the strain out of pulling loads of shopping around in a recent patent application.  Its designs look similar to the traditional two-wheeled trolley bags that have long been towed around by grannies on their trip to the Post Office.  But rather than needing to be tugged behind the user, Ford\u0026rsquos trolley features two different modes.  According to the patent, the handle of the trolley is packed with sensors that detect when it is being pulled, controlling the wheels so that it moves along at the same pace as its owner.  Each of the wheels is powered independently to make cornering easier and on downhill slopes it can apply a braking force to prevent the person using it being knocked over by heavy loads.  \u0026ldquoThe shopping trolley has an inclination sensor for detecting the inclination of the travel surface, Ford states in the patent. It also describes how the trolley can deal with steps or kerbs.  Sensors or cameras on the front of the trolley allow it to detect steps and then apply more power to the wheels to make it easier to mount these obstacles.  But while the trolley can be pulled along by the shopper, Ford also wants it to be able to move by itself, following the shopper at an acceptable distance.  Rod Dennis, a spokesman for the RAC, said: \u0026ldquoWhile it might be the promise of autonomous cars that tends to grab the headlines, it\u0026rsquos much more likely that we\u0026rsquoll see smaller-scale smart technology like this."},{"url":null,"title":"rules-force-more-accurate-broadband-speed-adverts","story":"  a consumer group has found.

Her visit to the Fort de Bregancon followed fresh warnings about the economic impact of the failure to reach a deal on the UK\u0026rsquos departure from the European Union.  Earlier, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned the chances of a no-deal brexit were \u0026ldquouncomfortably high and said crashing out the EU would be \u0026ldquohighly undesirable.  He said the prospect of the UK leaving Europe without any kind of deal on future trade and customs arrangements was \u0026ldquoa relatively unlikely, but it is a possibility.  The UK and Europe should do all things to avoid a no-deal scenario, he said.  It would mean \u0026ldquodisruption to trade as we know it and therefore a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time, he said.  He saide: \u0026ldquoI think the possibility of a no-deal is uncomfortably high at this point. It is highly undesirable. Parties should do all things to avoid it.  However, he said the UK\u0026rsquos banks had been stress-tested to ensure they could withstand the shock of a no-deal if it did happen.  His remarks led to the pound falling sharply to just under $1.30. He was speaking the day after the Bank\u0026rsquos Monetary Policy Committee raised interest rates to their highest level in nine years, from a base rate of 0.5 to 0.75 per cent.  Mr Carney denied the move was designed to build some slack into the system in anticipation of Brexit, in case rates needed to be lowered again as an emergency measure.  Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group of MPs, dismissed Mr Carney\u0026rsquos comments.  He said: \u0026ldquoMark Carney has long been the high priest of project fear whose reputation for inaccurate and politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the Bank of England.

Although people have long wondered how and why the famous monument was built, the question of \u0026ldquowho built it has received much less attention.  Now, a study sheds some light on these prehistoric people and where they came from. Using new technology that can determine where dead people lived, scientists say cremated human remains from the site show some of the people there came from other parts of western Britain, most likely Wales.  Those people also probably lugged some of the Welsh stones that were used to construct Stonehenge, according to the study, published in the  journal Scientific Reports.  Stonehenge, one of the most impressive prehistoric megalithic monuments on Earth, is a World Heritage site known for its alignment with the movements of the Sun.  Thousands of people travel there each year to mark the solstices in summer and winter.  However, \u0026ldquodespite over a century of intense study of Stonehenge, we still know very little about the individuals buried at the site, the study said.  To rectify this, researchers analysed skull bones from 25 individuals buried at the monument to better understand the lives of the people there.  \u0026ldquoWhile 15 of the people were local to the Stonehenge region, the other 10 probably spent at least the last few years of their lives in present-day Wales, study authors say.  The cremated remains suggest that people not only supplied the stones used to build the stone circle, but also \u0026ldquomoved with the stones and were buried there too, the study said.  Although the geographically intermediate examples hint at there being a well-worn prehistoric land route between west Wales and Stonehenge, nobody yet knows exactly how the stones (and the cremated remains) were transported. Sea and land routes are both possible.  Study lead author Rick Schulting, of Oxford University, said \u0026ldquothe really remarkable thing about our study is the ability of new developments in science to extract so much new information from such small and unpromising fragments of bone."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-call-for-watchdog-to-check-david-mundell-dark-money-funding","story":"  The SNP said the Scottish Secretary should explain why he didn\u0026rsquot declare thousands of pounds of support from the controversial Scottish Unionist Association Trust (SUAT) in his parliamentary register of interests.  The Herald revealed yesterday that the SUAT, which is being investigated by the Electoral Commission over its status as a political donor, helped bankroll a campaign manager for Mr Mundell at the last two general elections.  Mr Mundell reported his campaign manager costs as \u0026pound3488 in 2015 and \u0026pound2400 in 2017.  The Tories said Mr Mundell didn\u0026rsquot need to register the money at the Commons as the SUAT gave it to his local party, not to him, to fund a campaign manager.  However the Commons Code of Conduct says MPs must register donations over \u0026pound1500 given to a local party and there is \u0026ldquoa clear link between the donation and [the MP] for example, if it was given... with a wish that it be allocated... to his or her fighting fund.  Mr Mundell, the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale \u0026amp Tweeddale, has never declared any financial support from the SUAT in his register of interests.  Nor did he refer to the SUAT\u0026rsquos financial support in his office candidate return in 2015.  The salary for Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager in 2017 was split 50-50 by the SUAT and Scottish Borders Conservative \u0026amp Unionist Association.  The cost in 2015 was split between the SUAT and Tory HQ in London, although the Borders Association accounts do not say if this was also a 50-50 split.  However invoices from Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign refer to 141 days \u0026ldquo@ 50%, suggesting it was an equal split.  If half the bill in 2015 was indeed met by the SUAT, this would be \u0026pound1744, above the \u0026pound1500 threshold for declarations in the register of interests.  The SUAT, which has given the Tories \u0026pound319,000 since 2001, does not publish accounts or detail the source of its income, leading to SNP claims it is a source of so-called \u0026lsquodark money\u0026rsquo, or untraceable political funding.  It was only after SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked Theresa May about the SUAT in the Commons last month that it finally published a list of its trustees.  The SUAT chair is Robert Miller-Bakewell, who was Borders Association chair and treasurer in 2014 and 2015, when the SUAT began funding Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager.  SNP MSP George Adam said: \u0026ldquoThe dark money scandal goes from bad to worse.  \u0026ldquoThere are questions over whether David Mundell failed to properly declare the benefit he received. Was he trying to hide something? In the interests of complete transparency it\u0026rsquos high time Mr Mundell was open and honest about the source of these funds.  \u0026ldquoThe Secretary of State should refer himself to the Commissioner for Standards to investigate whether he breached strict parliamentary rules over declaring political donations.  Mr Miller-Bakewell did not respond to requests for comment.  A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \u0026ldquoThere is no requirement to place this funding on the MPs Register of Interests. This funding was not given to Mr Mundell or to his fighting fund. It was given to the local association to help fund regional campaign managers over recent years.  \"In compliance with the rules, it was therefore registered as a donation with the Electoral Commission. \"Mr Mundell properly declared the value of the campaign manager in his election returns in 2015 and 2017.  \"As an MP of 13 years standing, Mr Mundell has a track record of complete transparency and every donation he has received in compliance with both the spirit and letter of the rules.\"?"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers-clarify-booze-crackdown-amid-confusion","story":"  Wholesalers who sell to both the public and trade will now have to operate a dual-pricing system, applying MUP to sales to the public but not to trade sales.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail. It will see the construction of new station platforms, lifts/overbridge, passenger waiting shelters, a new access road, a 160 space car park, a pedestrian and cycle path and secure cycle parking facilities. The new station, which accompanies Network Rail’s Aberdeen to Inverness Improvement Project, is due to re-open to passenger services in late 2019.

Yvette Harrison, Manager of Mackie’s 19.2 in the city’s Marischal Square, said: “In some ways it’s sad to say goodbye to the peanut butter tap. It really did create a buzz online and off and gave customers an extra special element to top their desserts with.        “It’s one of those naughty treats that actually has health benefits, and fans were going nuts for it when it launched in March.“However, we have chosen to replace the tap as we want to ensure that enjoyment of the parlour is available to all. When we learned that it was putting off some of those with severe nut allergies we made the decision to phase it out and replace it.”The Willy Wonka-style tap, which dispensed warm, smooth peanut butter for topping waffles, ice cream and crepes was a hit with customers looking to add a savoury element to their sweet treats.Viral videos of the UK-first tap racked up nearly 3million views on the likes of LADBible and UNILAD.                                                                                                        Although the departure of the tap will come as sad news for many nut butter lovers, those looking for a new topping for their desserts won’t have to wait too long, as Mackie’s is close to finalising the tap’s replacement flavour.Yvette added: “I don’t want to give too much away just yet, but for many this will be a taste of their childhood and an all-round favourite for waffles, crepes and sundae scoops.“The new tap could well be ready to go in the next week so make sure you head down to the parlour and be one of the first to try our new creation.”In addition to the success of the taps, Mackie’s is also on course for their most successful summer of sales ever.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974.

He is the chieftain of the Mey Games and last year was asked to become the patron of the Scottish Highland Games Association.He said Prince Charles is aware of the community links to the Mey Games and its sporting and cultural significance.\u0026ldquoThe prince wants to encourage young people to take part in Highland Games in future and was driven by what he saw happening at Mey, Mr Lovie said.After the launch, The Prince\u0026rsquos Foundation, High Life Highland, Highland Council and the Scottish Highland Games Association will look at ways to develop the plans further. It may be possible at some point to have a junior games.The idea will be taken into secondary schools to start with, although in the longer term primaries would be included as well.

He will train youth leaders in the area to pass on the skills and techniques used in tossing the caber, tug-of-war and hammer-throwing.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are currently few routes into Highland Games for young people in Scotland. Many will never have experienced the enjoyment of participating in traditional Highland sports.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services. They will need some convincing therefore that their interests lie at the heart of these proposals.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This puts the institution two per cent above the Scottish average.UHI has also performed above the Scottish sector in almost all measures and this high level of student satisfaction can be found across all areas of the partnership.Dr Iain Morrison, dean of students, said: “This wonderful result has been achieved through cohesive, coordinated and collective efforts by many people across the partnership. Every single member of teaching, support and admin staff and our partners in the Highlands and Islands Students’ Association can have a positive impact on a student’s experience and we work hard at making the university even better every day.\u0026#8220To have these efforts recognised in the most important national measure of student satisfaction is testament to the high quality of hard-working colleagues we have, committed to the support and learning of our students.

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Saturday 4 Aug 2018 3:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Saturday 4 Aug 2018 3:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer.

After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Saturday 4 Aug 2018 3:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Murray earlier said in a statement on Facebook: “Sadly I won’t be able to take my place in the draw in Toronto.

Eastern Western – one of the country’s biggest players – has purchased the entire share capital of Barnetts Motor Group, which represents Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo from a large single site in Dundee and also Volkswagen in St Andrews.            No financial details have been disclosed for what is likely to have been a fairly substantial multi-million-pound deal.            The Barnetts business generated sales of £65.3 million last year and returned a £1.3m pre-tax profit.The Volvo franchise will be transferred to the John Clark Motor Group, as revealed earlier this week, and in turn Eastern Western Motor Group acquires the Nissan businesses in Dundee and Perth. Nissan in Dundee will be rehoused in the showroom vacated by Volvo.Douglas Brown, group managing director of Eastern Holdings, Eastern Western Motor Group’s parent company, said: “We have known Paul Barnett for many years and as a result it has been a quick, professional and seamless transaction.“Barnetts Motor Group and the Nissan franchises in Dundee and Perth will be a great addition to the Eastern Western Motor Group.

The black-tie Pegasus Ball at Hampden Park in Glasgow, where tickets cost £75 each, will raise money for the charity Soldiers Off the Streets Scotland, (SOTS) whose head organiser north of the Border has twice stood as a British National Party (BNP) candidate at Westminster elections.            Walter Hamilton was the BNP candidate for Glasgow Central in 2005 and stood for Glasgow North East in 2010.             Money raised will go to a new housing project for veterans in Scotland run by SOTS, with the remaining funds going to the Pegasus Appreciation Group for a permanent memorial statue for the Parachute Regiment statue in Aldershot.The evening will be hosted by Rusty Firmin, an SAS veteran who took part in the operation to free hostages from the Iranian Embassy siege in London in 1980.However, anti-facist opponents say such charities with far-right connections are exploiting vulnerable veterans who can be struggling with a range of issues including mental health and homelessness when they leave the forces.Paul Sweeney, Scottish Labour MP for Glasgow North East and Shadow Scotland Office minister, whose remit includes responsibility for defence matters in Scotland, said inadequate government funding for veterans created a “vacuum” for unsuitable organisation.“We owe a debt of gratitude to our armed forces for the sacrifices they make in our name.             “That the government fails to fund services for veterans is a breach of the military covenant and should be a source of national shame. That abdication of responsibility by the authorities creates a vacuum which can be exploited by people and organisations with suspect motives.“The principles upheld by our armed forces around the world are far removed from the warped values of hateful groups like the BNP. “It is disappointing to find out that a worthy cause has been hijacked by such an unsavoury character.”Mr Hamilton said he did not want to comment on the fundraising event.            The charity said it offered help to Darren Greenfield, the veteran who begged in Princes Street and died a week before Christmas last year. Mr Greenfield refused offers of help.In February the far-right Scottish Defence League protested outside Bute House in Edinburgh, holding placards reading “Veterans Before Refugees.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777920.1533233129!/image/image.jpg","title":"cameron wyllie hey teachers leave those cool kids alone","story":"        Teachers should be relaxed about some pupils being \u0026#8216cool\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 it\u0026#8217s a quality like being good-looking or charming, if not actually one of the big virtues, such as honesty, loyalty and kindness, writes former headteacher Cameron Wyllie.                Five years ago, I was on an October Week trip to New York City organised by the art-and-design department of the school where I was a senior manager.            The party consisted of me, two lovely pals of mine who taught art and design, and 25 students from the senior years.             We did a little bit of NYC tourist stuff and toured the politan Museum, The Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney. We saw a show. And, of course, we shopped. The hours for shopping were strictly regulated but we all got our fix and, let’s be honest, the typical pupil of art and design does like a nice outfit.Thus I found myself in the flagship store of Uniqlo on Fifth Avenue, while the young people threw themselves at arty T-shirts, puffer jackets and unusually patterned footwear.I, being approximately 18 times their age, contented myself browsing among the astonishingly cheap cardigans. Then I tried on a hat – a simple old-fashioned trilby in grey and burgundy. While I was considering the crumbling view in the mirror, one of the kids wandered past and said, “Good hat. You should buy that.” Now this was one of the seven boys on the trip, a young man of definite style who, like many of them, dressed with the easy detachment of fashionable youth.            So I did buy that hat (in the sale, $12) and every time I wear it, someone will say “I like your hat” or “great hat” or “Where did you get that hat?” or “You suit that hat”. It doesn’t matter what artfully contrived combination of other clothes I have on, the blooming hat gets the praise, the one thing that I didn’t really pick myself. I don’t know whether to be grateful or irritated.READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: Here’s how the snowflake generation can toughen upThe truth is, some people are cool and most of us are not. A common complaint about young people in schools is that they spend way too much time trying to be cool – in the staffroom, wise old heads nod together and say of some errant child, “Aye that one’s too cool for school.”             It isn’t completely clear to anyone what ‘cool’ really means but essentially we all understand it – at a school leavers’ function some years back I used the word ‘cool’ in praise of one of the other young people there, which led to a discussion about who, exactly, was ‘cool’ in this group of people they had been with for years and years. They unanimously identified five or six people who combined some of the necessary characteristics and I could only concur with their selection. There were no hard feelings – only a few are chosen and the rest of us just have to get on with it.What teachers need to accept is that there’s nothing wrong with being cool – it’s just something that happens, like being very funny or having good hair. We need to stop railing about ‘coolness’ like we rail about smoking or idleness (it may be that some cool kids smoke and some are lazy but it’s not a necessary part of the conidition).             One school I know of went through such an ‘anti-cool campaign’ that it enlisted children to wear ‘Glad To Be Sad’ badges, which I personally felt to be going a bit far (though I imagine the badges themselves are now collectors’ items).This kind of approach towards a particular kind of teenager only encourages all teenagers to exaggerate the gulf in attitudes between themselves and their teachers heaven forfend, it may make them think that some of their teachers are a teeny bit jealous because they themselves were never cool, and never will be. READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertIncidentally, make no mistake – when a 16-year-old says “I think Mr Smith is cool”, it probably just means that Mr Smith does not impose the regulations regarding late homework, not that the young person would let Mr Smith choose their hair products.So let’s try to view ‘cool’ differently. Let’s see it as a desirable personal characteristic that some people have and let’s look at it positively. In educating young Scots about the state of the world they’re going into, let’s talk with them about all the different characteristics humanity shares, and instead of sneering at this vague but desirable state, let’s praise them all for what they give the world.  Of course, there’s a big range of personal virtues to choose from and ‘cool’, given its temporary nature, goes in the column with ‘good looks’ and ‘charm’, rather than being a big hitter like ‘honesty’, ‘loyalty’ or, biggest of all, ‘kindness’. Instead of being so negative and taking the risk of alienating pupils who, let’s face it, are usually popular with their peers, let’s accentuate the positive and gently point out what really matters in the long term whether you’re cool or not.  The American singer Courtney Marie Andrews puts it well: “And if your money runs out/And your good looks fade/May your kindness remain.” Heidies – there’s a good message for the first assembly of term!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778821.1533384777!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom harris resigns from labour party after 34 years","story":"        Former Glasgow MP and transport minister Tom Harris has quit Labour after 34 years in the midst of the anti-Semitism row engulfing the party.                 The former transport minister, has quit Labour after 34 years in the midst of the anti-Semitism row engulfing the party.             Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has called for “further discussion and dialogue” with the Jewish community as the row over anti-Semitism continues.            Mr Leonard said the party needed to win the confidence of Jewish supporters, however he stopped short of backing the adoption of the international definition of anti-Semitism in full.Several Labour MSPs have expressed their support for the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition to be accepted by Labour in its entirety, including a list of examples.Pressed on his views during an interview with BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland, Mr Leonard said: “I am willing to recommend we have further discussion and dialogue with the Jewish community, including the Jewish community in Scotland, which I intend to lead on, because we need to win the confidence of the Jewish community.“We need to get to a position where not only have we got a very robust code on anti-Semitism within the Labour Party - which we are striving to achieve - but also which allows for freedom of speech, a discourse around Palestine and Israel.”He added: “I want to make sure that the Labour Party is not only a party that the Jewish community supports, but is prepared to join and be active in.”            “There has got to be a way through this, and the way through this may be that we do, in the end, adopt in full all of the working examples in the IHRA code, but I am also determined to make sure that freedom of speech is maintained inside the Labour Party too.”Mr Leonard’s comments come as Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to build bridges with the Jewish community were rebuffed by critics.The Labour leader has insisted he will root out anti-Semites from Labour and acknowledged mistakes in the way the party had handled the crisis.But the Jewish Labour Movement said trust had broken down with the party leadership, while the Campaign Against Antisemitism lashed out at Mr Corbyn’s failure to apologise for his own conduct.            Tory MP Paul Masterton said: “Richard Leonard appears as lacklustre as Jeremy Corbyn when it comes to tackling anti-Semitism in Labour.“Many within his own party will find it hard to understand why he was unable to endorse the IHRA code under questioning this morning.“With former Glasgow MP Tom Harris resigning from the party this weekend after 34 years, Labour is once again in chaos.”Mr Harris has been a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn and told The Herald newspaper on his resignation from Labour: “It’s just not the place for me any more”.Mr Harris represented Glasgow Cathcart then Glasgow South from 2001 to 2015, and was transport minister from 2006 to 2008.

One of three options put forward by the city council is for “a radical rethink of how the city moves and operates” where “key streets could be pedestrianised”.            The document, called ‘Connecting our cities, transforming our places’, explains three approaches to potentially overhauling the future of transport in the Scottish capital.            City centre routes such as Princes and George streets on which cars, buses and taxis could be banned have not yet been specifically identified in a report that proposes what would be the greatest transport shake-up of Edinburgh’s Old and New Towns.But the report does say: “The city centre would become a largely traffic free zone, with controls in place to allow for essential traffic and with pedestrian priority in the city, town and local centres.“You would be able to go to, but not through the city centre.“A series of hubs could be developed where buses would drop off and other forms of less impactful transport would take over.“Pavements would be significantly widened and public spaces improved. Key streets would be pedestrianised.”            The report adds: “There would be strategic walking routes and segregated cycle routes across the city, with a citywide wayfinding network to guide pedestrians around the city.“Public transport could be fully integrated with smart contactless payment for use across all public transport services. New park and ride interchanges could be provided at key points around the city, with a series of new bus priority corridors linked to them.” Another ‘prospectus’ option to be put to the public includes a “business-as-usual approach”, although the Scottish Government is requiring the council to establish a Low Emission Zone (LEZ). Scotland’s first pollution-reducing LEZ is to be set up in Glasgow at the end of this year, with fines for motorists who enter the boundary in proscribed vehicles after a certain date.The third option is a “strategic approach” that highlights possible “controls on the levels of general traffic, with restrictions on through traffic within certain areas”.            The report adds: “Priority would be for people on foot and bicycles on specific streets, including George Street and the Royal Mile. Gaps in the existing walking and cycling networks would be completed.” The report points out the three options are not mutually exclusive.Subject to approval from the council’s transport and environment committee, the eight-week public engagement will start next month.City council transport convener Councillor Lesley Macinnes said: “We are very conscious that we have a city centre residential population in marked contrast to many other cities. We need to take care of their needs and expectations of where they live. It’s also about those who visit and those who come into the city centre.“Health is a key aspect of this and it’s about air quality. It’s about providing more opportunities to walk and cycle and better use of public transport.”Cllr Macinnes added: “What is really exciting about the prospectus is the vision that it represents. The status quo is not enough for this city.”            Other transport plans mooted in a bid to ease congestion could involve bus lane operating hours returning to seven days a week.The council’s transport committee will also consider installing more automatic cameras to make sure motorists keep out of bus lanes. Some bus lanes in the city only operate during peak times, but bus operators have told the council they would like the hours to be extended to speed up journey times. The public transport routes could operate from 7am to 7pm, seven days a week.Since being introduced in 2012, Edinburgh’s bus lane cameras have tallied up £4.4 million in fines."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays.

Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nSaturday 4 Aug 2018 3:37 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sleat-and-Strath.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

That is a nonsense and the British government need to be called out on it. \n\"There is a big responsibility on Taoiseach Leo Vardakar and a responsibility on Michel Barnier and our partners in Europe to stand firm. \n\"The British government need to understand that they can\u0027t simply arrive in Ireland and set out a plan that is so destructive to our interests and expect that there won\u0027t be a mighty reaction to that,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27423  ","story":"Sinn Féin leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nSinn Féin leaders will meet the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier later today to make it clear that the issues of Ireland and the border need to resolved before the next EU summit in October. \nParty President Mary Lou McDonald TD and deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill MLA will meet Mr Barnier in Brussels later today at the headquarters of the EU Commission. \nAt today\u0027s meeting, the pair are expected to tell the EU negotiator that the backstop already agreed between the EU and the British government must be maintained and form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. \nThat backstop would see the north remain in the customs union and elements of the single market and would avoid the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nThe Sinn Féin leaders will also call on Michel Barnier to ensure the issues of the border and Ireland are resolved ahead of the next planned EU summit in October. \nOne way of doing this would be to hold a special EU summit in September to deal specifically with Irish issues, they are expected to tell he chief negotiator. \nToday\u0027s meeting will be the latest in a series of meetings between Sinn Féin and Michel Barnier both in Brussels and Ireland in recent months. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27424  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald TD along with Dáil Health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly TD and Assembly spokesperson on Mental Health Órlaithí Flynn MLA in Dublin today.\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The voices of women must be heard when it comes to healthcare.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

a great way to save money.\nA spokeswoman for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council this week refuted the claims, saying: There have been no instances lately of bins not being collected other than due to local access issues and these are always followed up the next day.\u0026#160 \nStaff in the Waste team have flexible job roles and are employed where needed across cleansing, waste and recycling centres.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06.jpg","title":"65378  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship has taken place.\nEleven international teams are making Antrim their home for this week\u0027s event. \nTwo hundred young people from USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain,\u0026#160 Republic of Ireland,\u0026#160 France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nSpectators will have a great view from the Lough Shore of the 11 picturesque gigs as they race on Lough Neagh.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a03.jpg","title":"65381  ","story":"    \nA SECTARIAN killer has appeared at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court charged with escaping lawful custody.\nStanding handcuffed in the dock, 32-year-old Christopher Kerr spoke only to confirm that he understood the four charges against him.\nIn addition to an offence of escaping lawful custody, Kerr is also accused of three drugs offences.\nThe alleged offences arose after he allegedly ran away from prison officers in Victoria Square shopping centre while out on day release.\nKerr, who is currently serving a life term for the shocking and horrifying sectarian attack which claimed the life of 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy Michael McIlveen, was arrested at Antrim Area Hospital the following day. \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f2.jpg","title":"65382  ","story":"    \nA CRUMLIN family has again been hit by tragedy after the sudden death of a teenager, just weeks after his father passed away.\nHenry Turley (14)\u0026#160 fell from a hotel balcony in the beach resort of Playa de Muro on Majorca in the early hours of last Wednesday (July 18).\nSpanish Civil Guard said his mother Claire was holding on to his hand and attempting to save him after he overbalanced on the second floor balcony before he fell at around midnight.\nHenry\u0027s death comes less than seven weeks after his father Stephen, who ran the Ten Storey tattoo parlour in Crumlin, was discovered dead at a friend\u0027s house.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f-jpg.jpg","title":"65469  ","story":"    \nWITH last weekend\u0027s downpour bringing Antrim to a standstill, it was no surprise that rain also stopped played at Muckamore Cricket Club!\nAfter weeks of fine weather, normal service was finally resumed with one of the most dramatic downpours in living memory.\nMuckamore Firsts were taking on North Down at the time, but the players soon beat a hasty retreat to the clubhouse when the skies opened.

Everything will be included in the exhibition at the end of the project.”\n\nThe Caravan Gallery has recently spoken at The Martin Parr Foundation on its approach to engaging communities and has

paisley by election petition to be set up in three north antrim towns","story":"\nThe petition to remove Ian Paisley as North Antrim MP and force a by-election will be available for signing at three locations in the constituency, it has been confirmed.\n\n                \nIn a public notice in today’s News Letter, the Electoral Office reveals that the petition will be available to sign in north Antrim’s three main towns – Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nIan Paisley has vowed to stand again for election if he is forced into a by-election\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMembers of the public who want to force a by-election – in which Mr Paisley has made clear he will stand for re-election – will be able to sign from 9am next Wednesday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition will be open to sign until 5pm each week day at the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney, the Seven Towers Leisure Centre in Ballymena and the Sheskburn House Recreation Centre in Ballycastle.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe petition will remain open to sign for six weeks, until 19 September.\n\nThere will also be evening signings – something required by the legislation governing recall petitions – on September 6 and 13, when the petition can be signed up until 9pm.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea – who is responsible for the process – had discretion under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 to designate up to 10 locations within the constituency for the petition to be signed.\n\nMeanwhile, the DUP has clarified that Ian Paisley has not left the party after some confusion yesterday in the wake of Parliament redesignating the North Antrim MP as an independent.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe party confirmed that Mr Paisley remained suspended, rather than having been expelled, and as part of that the party had withdrawn the whip from him.\n\nThat puts him in the same category as MPs such as Ivan Lewis, who is suspended by Labour and is listed as an independent.\n\nThe recall process was automatically triggered when Mr Paisley was given a suspension of 30 sitting days – the longest on record since at least 1949 – over “serious misconduct” relating to taking free luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then lobbying on behalf of the regime without declaring that they had given the valuable gifts to himself and his family.\n\nThe DUP veteran apologised for not declaring the holidays but insisted to Parliament’s standards commissioner that his letter asking the prime minister to change UK policy at the UN to that favoured by Sri Lanka did not amount to lobbying for the regime.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition to remove Mr Paisley will have to be signed by 7,547 people – 10% of the eligible North Antrim electorate – if there is to be a by-election.\n\nUnlike the situation with an election, any voter – not just those who can provide a legitimate reason for not being able to vote in person – will be able to apply to sign the petition by post.\n\nThat rule, about which DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has expressed concern, is in place because, unlike an election, it will be known that anyone going into the signing place will be there to sign the petition, reducing the typical anonymity around an election.\n\nParties wanting to campaign for people to sign the petition will have to register if they are planning to spend more than £500.\n\n

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix.

I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"actor jamie dornan captured on canvas","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Irrespective of how strong an argument or position, maybe it is always wrong to assume that circumstances cannot or will not change. My view remains that the Union will survive. But it will not survive because Robinson, Sammy Wilson and I say so.\n\nIt will only survive if unionism, collectively and individually, makes a strong case, sells the message, expands the support base and prepares for all eventualities. That is all Robinson is saying.\n\nWhen I suggested in an article a couple of weeks before the 2017 Assembly election that there was a possibility - albeit a slim one - unionists could lose their overall majority, a leading DUP MLA told me, \"Don\u0027t be silly, Alex, that\u0027s not going to happen. \n\n\"Why would you even write something like that?\"\n\nWell, they lost that majority. Unionists don\u0027t have a majority of either Council or Assembly seats across Belfast (24/60 BCC and 6/20 NIA). The overall vote for candidates who declared themselves as pro-Union/unionist at the last few elections has hovered uncomfortably close to or slightly lower than the 50% barrier.\n\nWhile recent opinion polls haven\u0027t given a consistent trend on support for Irish unity, they do suggest that what happens regarding the final Brexit deal could have a significant impact on two or three key demographics.\n\nGiven that sort of background, it would be a very sanguine or very stupid unionist who would argue that unionists shouldn\u0027t give serious consideration to a number of possibilities. The primary one, as Robinson says, is that a border poll is possible, particularly under a Labour government. It is the Secretary of State who makes the call - not unionists, not the DUP, not even Sammy Wilson. I would prefer that the leaders of unionism had given some thought to the possibility and made some sort of preparation for the campaign rather, than as Robinson says, burying their heads in the sand until \"only the soles of their feet are visible above the surface\".\n\nRobinson, Wilson and the rest of us from that generation will remember the body blow dealt to unionism by the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. They will remember the despair. They will remember how close we came to a tipping point. They will remember that something dismissed as an impossibility by the leadership of unionism at the time happened: happened over their heads and without any consultation.\n\nOnly a fool, a blinkered, irresponsible, thoroughly delusional fool would believe that a British government would not, again, spring another monumental shock upon unionism. And only a unionist of monumental stupidity would refuse to discuss, let alone prepare for that eventuality. \"Contingency planning is a judicious safety-net. Better by far to plan for adverse possibilities, no matter how remote, than be left clueless and unprepared if our hopes and evaluations are wrong\". Robinson is right. He wrote something similar in the joint UUP/DUP response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement published in June 1987 (The Task Force Report: An End To Drift):\n\n\"The temptation in such circumstances might be to do nothing. However we would consider this the ultimate abdication of responsibility.\"\n\nTo be honest, not much was done. Unionism paid the price of that ongoing abdication of responsibility by the leadership of both parties.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"meet the northern ireland hockey stars who are on the verge of conquering the world","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Also out are hosts England, some of whom struck gold as Team GB at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nPutting Ireland\u0027s achievement in context, the England players are all full-time professionals and its hockey association budget in the Olympic cycle up until Tokyo 2020 is £17.6m.\n\nIreland has around 5% of that figure and, bar three players who are on career-breaks and playing abroad, the entire squad work for a living or are students.\n\nUntil recently, the players had to pay an annual levy of around £500 per year to cover training, pitch hire and travel costs.\n\nBelfast midfielder, solicitor Lizzie Colvin, said: \"We don\u0027t mind the sacrifices we have had to make as we all love the sport and it\u0027s a dream come true to even be at a World Cup, let alone in a semi-final. We have already exceeded expectations but we don\u0027t want to stop now and look forward to putting in another big performance against Spain.\"\n\nIrish fans have gone to London in their droves since Ulster goalkeeper\u0027s Ayeisha McFerran\u0027s quarter-final heroics in a penalty shoot-out, when they defeated India.\n\nThe 100,000 tickets for the finals weekend were sold out months ago.\n\nHowever, many of those who had bought tickets were expecting hosts England to have been in the final four weekend. Many have been resold on social media. \n\nBelfast man Davy Frazer, over with his wife and family to support his Harlequins club mates, Lizzie Colvin and Zoe Wilson, has had mixed fortunes.\n\nHe said: \"I had planned to go home when Ireland got knocked out. So, we decided to stay on when that didn\u0027t happen. We managed to pick up the three tickets needed for Saturday.\n\n\"But we still haven\u0027t got sorted for Sunday\u0027s final or bronze medal play-off depending on how Ireland get on against Spain.\"\n\nIf Larne\u0027s Ayeisha McFerran gets her way, Ireland will be in the final. She said: \"We\u0027ve grown in confidence with every game and are confident we can get into the final. We\u0027ve beaten them before and we can do it again.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland athletes in dublin games commended","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Both were later released on bail.\n\nLast month Inga-Maria\u0027s nephew Viktor Leibl (25) visited Northern Ireland for the first time, paying his respects at the memorial.\n\nHe said his family took comfort from the fact that so many people here have kept her memory alive.\n\nHe added that his mother Friederike, Inga-Maria\u0027s sister, also planned to make a visit in the future.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173767.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/E%20310718KB4%20%200003.jpg","title":"pride 2018 belfast out on the roof summer","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands take to streets for belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

when the Assembly was sitting.\n\n\nLifeline \n@belfastpride\n march \n#bproud2018\n \n#ComeOutForChange\n \npic.twitter/gPgRHTxvDN\n\n— Belfast Pride (@belfastpride) \nAugust 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster claimed on Thursday that a bid to fly a Pride flag at a council building was a republican ruse to remove the Union flag.\n\nArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council (ABC) councillors had voted to fly the flag at the weekend, to coincide with Pride Day, but DUP members triggered a procedural mechanism on Tuesday claiming that proper process had not been followed.\n\nThe “call-in” mechanism, which needs the backing of 15% of councillors, requires officials to seek legal advice on a course of action before proceeding.\n\nMrs Foster told BBC Radio Ulster: “As I understand it, the issue is not about Pride, the issue is about that the policy in the ABC council is only to fly the Union flag and the Armed Forces Day flag, and colleagues felt this was a ruse by republicans to remove our national flag, and it’s not about respect or Pride at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers from the Belfast Azlans, a gay rugby team, enjoy a game before joining Belfast Pride (Michael Cooper/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“We should have respect for each other but not if it’s going to be used as a ruse to take down the national flag.”\n\nThe move was labelled “bizarre” by Sinn Fein.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of around 50 Christian anti-Pride campaigners gathered at Belfast City Hall to protest against the event, reading Bible verses and singing hymns.\n\nThe Pride Festival is now one of the biggest events in Belfast and it has involved more than 100 events across 10 days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mediation call as dublinbased ryanair pilots stage fourth strike","story":"\n

Proposes Mr Kieran Mulvey: \nhttps://t.co/QO3aQgyM9Q\n\n— Ryanair (@Ryanair) \nAugust 3, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLast month, the budget airline criticised the strikes as unnecessary and warned that, if they continue, there could be job losses.\n\nForsa said the striking workers continue to seek a “fair and transparent” way of governing base transfers and related matters which they say is common practice in the industry.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday it said: “For over a month, the union has said that industrial action is likely to continue until there is substantial movement on the pilots’ reasonable demands for an agreement on a fair and transparent approach to base transfers and related matters.\n\n“The airline’s escalation of the dispute when it threatened to sack 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew, or transfer them to Poland, led to a predictable hardening of resolve among its staff.\n\n“Company management met the union the day before the first one-day strike, and two days before the second one-day strike (on July 18). It then changed its position and said it would not negotiate while strike action was planned.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyanair pilots strike placard at the airline headquarter’s in Swords, Dublin\n\n\n\n\nThe union said two weeks have passed since its last meeting with management and warned that a resolution to the dispute cannot be reached if the airline has “pre-conditions”.\n\nThe union added: “On a number of occasions in recent weeks and months, there have been suggestions that third-party facilitation could assist in reaching consensus on issues of disagreement.\n\n“Forsa has today repeated to the company that it is willing to explore this option.”\n\nThe airline said the latest action had no effect since all 3,500 customers (of the 430,000 travelling with Ryanair on Friday) were re-accommodated or refunded last weekend.\n\nAer Lingus declined to comment on the Ryanair claims.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tenor bocelli to perform for pope at dublin event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

privilege for our soul it is an honour for what the Supreme Pontiff represents in the world\nAndrea Bocelli\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe singer said: “Singing before Pope Francis is a privilege for our soul it is an honour for what the Supreme Pontiff represents in the world.\n\n“For the indescribable human fragility, typical of the average man such as myself, it brings me great pleasure and immense satisfaction to even have the privilege to be close to a person of such exceptional importance and grace.\n\n“It is a joy to be able to offer my most modest contribution on the occasion of this grand meeting and moment of reflection about the family.\n\n“The family remains the strongest building block of society, a cluster of affection, and a privileged space in which one can teach and learn – in every action – how to choose a life that leads toward the greater good.”\n\nFather Timothy Bartlett, secretary general of the World Meeting of Families 2018 event, said he was delighted.\n\n“He will bring so much to our gathering not just because of his wonderful talent but because of his love for his faith.\n\n“We are honoured that he has taken time out of an intensely busy schedule to come to Ireland to be part of our global celebration of family life.”\n\nBocelli has met Pope Francis and has performed for him on more than one occasion including at the last World Meeting of Families which took place in Philadelphia in 2015.\n\nHe is a devout Catholic and he has spoken openly many times about the importance of faith and how it takes first place in his life.\n\nHe has regularly donated his time and talent to causes and events that he is passionate about.\n\nBocelli will join other well-known acts already announced for the event including Nathan Carter, Daniel O’Donnell and Moya Brennan.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"highs of 31c expected as britain basks in glorious","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

2018\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures could soar even higher early next week, with highs of 32C (89.6F) possible around London on Monday and Tuesday. \n\nBritons making the most of the balmy weekend were urged to stay “sun sensible” amid the high UV levels. \n\nHowever, not all of the UK will be gazing into clear blue skies – in Scotland and Northern Ireland clouds are likely with some thick enough to bring patchy rain to the north and west of Scotland. \n\nThe north-west, south-east split will continue early next week, with further showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland, while England and Wales stay generally dry and warmer. \n\n\nWe don’t know if you’ve heard… but it’s VERY… VERY hot!\n\nBe sun sensible this summer\n\n🌞🌞🌞 🌶️🌶️ 🌶️🌶️🌶️\n— EEAST Ambulance (@EastEnglandAmb) \nAugust 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures will need to climb significantly if they are to come close to England’s current August record – 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003.\n\nHowever, the intense heat is likely to lessen come Wednesday, as conditions turn “fresher and more changeable”, the Met Office said. \n\nIt comes amid an intense European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the sun most intensely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThe mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert.\n\nEarlier this week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, with temperatures peaking at 45.2C (113.4F) near Abrantes, a town in the centre of the country.\n\nEmergency services have issued a red alert until Sunday, with medical staff and firefighters on standby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA boy jumps from a platform over the water at La Concha beach in northern Spain (Alvaro Barrientos/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, 400 firefighters and five water-dropping aircraft are battling a wildfire in southern Portugal’s Algarve region.\n\nIn Spain, heat warnings have been issued for 41 of the country’s 50 provinces as temperatures are expected to reach up to 44C (111.2F).\n\nIn northern Europe, Sweden is still under threat from wildfires, which in recent weeks have extended into the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe Met Office said it was unlikely that the overall European highest temperature recorded – 48C (118.4F) in Athens, Greece in 1977 – would be beaten.\n\nBritish holiday-makers abroad are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds expected to attend asylum seeker eviction

Interim orders temporarily stopping the lock changes will allow this work to continue with our clients having a home to live in.”\n\nSerco chief executive Rupert Soames has said lock-change notices would be given to no more than 10 people a week for the next four weeks.\n\nHe said none of these would be families with children and all will be people who the Home Office considers to have exhausted their appeal process and no longer have the right to remain.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a couples dog photobombed their wedding picture and it couldnt have gone better","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I’ve openly breastfed in the Bowling Alley, in Bananas, Martha’s and the cafe... a girl working there even offered to bring me over a cup of tea while I was feeding... knew this didn’t sound right!’\n\nWhile one father remarked: ‘Couldn\u0027t believe the original post when I first saw it. My wife has breastfed our youngest in there many times without issue.’\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"caring cops commend helpful derry public offer support anyone feeling suicidal saying know whole city behind","story":"\nDerry cops commended compassionate members of the public in our city following an incident at the River Foyle on Thursday evening.\n\nThe PSNI praised the help Derry citizens offer those in distress and reached out to people who may be feeling suicidal to offer support.\n\nIn a heartfelt post on the PSNI Foyle Facebook page, an officer said: \u0027We, along with our partner agencies NIFRS, NIAS and Foyle Search and Rescue attended a number of incidents where people were going through a mental health crisis. \n\n\u0027What always amazes and inspires me is how so many people in this city are ready and willing to stop to help strangers in need.

set to be the biggest and most prestigious in its 37 year history when up to 2,500 runners descend on Ebrington Square for race start on Sunday September 2\nnd\n.\n\nEvent organisers Derry City and Strabane District Council and City of Derry Spartans have announced this week that the race will act as a qualifier for the NI squad for the inaugural Commonwealth Half Marathon Championships on Sunday October 7\nth\n in Cardiff.\n\nThe race has already been confirmed as the host event for the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships which has swelled demand for places as Race Director Gerry Lynch explained:\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])

entries to date as well as 40 plus relay teams of three which is a big increase on last year and indicates that the individual limit will be reached soon,” he revealed.\n\n“The NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships and qualification for the Commonwealth Championships is a big carrot for the top male and female entrants to aim for and this should add to the quality of the field and the up front competition on the day.\n\n“The event sells out every year and with the continued growth of athletics and running clubs locally our advice to anyone intending to take part is to register online now to avoid disappointment when entries close on August 13\nth\n.”\nThe Waterside Half Marathon is one of the longest running athletics events in Ireland with a scenic route that takes in both sides of the River Foyle, passing many of the city’s historic landmarks including its famous walls and the Guildhall.\nThe 13.1 mile course has runner, wheelchair and three person relay categories, the event is open to athletes of all levels and abilities and all entrants to the main race must be aged 17 or over on race day.\nA number of groups have already registered for the event to raise funds for their chosen charities including a group of over 20 runners from Firstsource Solutions in Derry who are taking part in aid of Foyle Search and Rescue.\nThe event includes a team of 12 pacers who will be identifiable at the race start by helium balloons displaying their times.\nPacer times start at 1 hour and 30 minutes and rise in increments of 15 minutes up to 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n“The pacers are all experienced runners who have studied the terrain of the course beforehand and they have always been spot on with their timings,” Gerry explained.\n“The beauty of having different pacers is that if peoples’ goals change during the race they have the option to slow down or speed up to join the pacers behind or in front.\n“Pacers will be walking around the start line for half an hour before the race and will be identifiable by helium balloons and t shirts showing their time so runners can file in behind them at the race start.”\n“It’s a spectator friendly route with the start and finish at St Columb’s Park and people can stand anywhere along the river bank on the west bank and enjoy the action.\n“Between the Peace Bridge and Coshowen runners will be running in both directions so that is a particularly good place to enjoy the action.”\nAll participants will receive a specially commissioned Waterside Half Marathon medal and race t shirt.\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13\nth\n August 2018 and you can register online now
