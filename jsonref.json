It breeds real devotion, I\u0027ve found.\u0027Titchmarsh said: \u0027It is always a privilege to spend time in the company of His Royal Highness and none more so than when it involves our mutual enjoyment of classical music.\u0027It is typically thoughtful of him to choose to highlight the plight of his many musical patronages, alongside the difficulties that all musicians face, during an unprecedented period when enjoyment of live music has been curtailed.\u0027 A Royal Appointment will be broadcast on Classic FM tonight at 8pm, with Charles presenting a show himself tomorrow at the same time. "},{"url":null,"title":"Lance Armstrong bought entire tables dinner drinks screamed f him","story":"Share this articleLance Armstrong says in film that stepfather ¿beat the (expletive) out of me¿Lance Armstrong documentary gets off to quite the start"},{"url":null,"title":"British Airways lay thousands cabin crew hire HALF PAY","story":"\u0027We are committed to consulting openly with our unions and our people as we prepare for a new future.\u0027  Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey said they \u0027cannot tolerate BA using this crisis as cover to impose a long term plan to slash jobs, pay and conditions.\u0027He added: \u0027No other employer has threatened to effectively \u0027fire and rehire\u0027 its entire workforce. Meanwhile, BA has paid out billions to shareholders and its taking taxpayers\u0027 money. Over 40,000 loyal BA staff now face the prospect of losing either their livelihoods or potentially being re-interviewed for their own jobs on vastly reduced terms and conditions.\u0027If the proposals were about dealing with the Covid crisis why are the company threatening to terminate contracts, including eliminating disciplinary procedures? This will not help the company get through Covid 19. This is nothing more than a cynical act of corporate greed and a betrayal of the BA workforce and Britain.\u0027Industry figures believe it could take airlines at least three years to return to pre-coronavirus levels, meaning they would not be able to financially support staff while flights remain unfilled.Others are attempting to preserve cash by offering vouchers to customers, instead of cash, and delaying payments.It comes after it was revealed last week that Airbus and Tui are set to slash thousands of jobs as planes around the world are grounded.In a further sign of the damage the coronavirus outbreak is doing to business, aircraft maker Airbus stands ready to axe more than 10,000 staff, possibly within days.And tour operator Tui warned that up to 8,000 jobs will go at its business following the dramatic collapse in air travel and holiday bookings.The prospect adds to the misery sweeping travel, aviation and aerospace. Plane maker Boeing is cutting 16,000 jobs while 12,000 staff face the axe at British Airways, 3,000 at Virgin Atlantic and 3,000 at Ryanair.Warning that the company is \u0027bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed\u0027, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury recently said \u0027we are now in the midst of the gravest crisis the industry has ever known\u0027.The company has 135,000 staff worldwide including 13,500 in the UK including in Broughton, North Wales, where it makes wings, and at Filton in Bristol where the wings are designed. A final decision on the job cuts has yet to be made.But Mr Faury believes it could take three to five years for passengers to be as willing to fly as before the crisis – hammering demand for planes.International travel restrictions have hit bookings, forcing Tui, which also runs cruises and airlines, to furlough or cut the pay of 90 per cent of its staff.It has already taken a €1.8billion (£1.6billion) German state loan and ditched the idend after cancelling most holidays in June.In the UK, output in travel and tourism halved in March, air travel fell 44 per cent, and accommodation by 45.7 per cent, according to the Office for National Statistics."},{"url":null,"title":"Topless Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar caught having picnic","story":"Share this articleTaoiseach has picnic with friends despite senior official discouraging public from doing so last week - Independent.ie"},{"url":null,"title":"Dominic Cummings dressed like GP","story":"Share this article \u0027He has asked me to repeat that account directly to you.

More useful, perhaps, is their inexplicable ability to navigate their way home from pretty much anywhere at distances of up to 700 miles in a day, and speeds of 100mph (with a tail wind), back home for a nice bowl of grain.‘No one knows how they do it,’ says James. ‘That’s why we respect them so much.’ But however pigeons achieve this, it made them perfect for delivering messages in war time (they are the most decorated animals of both world wars) and brilliant for racing. Yet even over 600-mile courses, they’ll never take the shortest route.So instead of travelling as the crow flies, they’ll follow the hollows of valleys, skirt thick woodland to evade hawks and trace the route of major roads, often going round the roundabouts and choosing the exit towards home.When Derek got his first pair of fan-tailed pigeons, aged seven, there were more than 100,000 registered pigeon racers. He started racing aged 13, has kept birds ever since and loves them with all his heart.‘It’s not a hobby, it’s a disease!’ he laughs. ‘Once you’ve touched one, you’re done.’ As was his first marriage, when his wife tired of his passion for pigeons.‘My second wife is much more understanding,’ he says.Indeed. She stood by happily as he gave up hundreds of thousands of hours to his birds, joined every pigeon club going, supported the annual shows in Blackpool and Epsom and encouraged their son, James, and now Elizabeth to do the same. Little wonder Elizabeth was up and running with her first breeding pair, Mr and Mrs Purplish, by the time she was seven.Just two years later, she’s ranked first overall at her local Bude Pigeon Racing Club, best junior racer for the Devon and Cornwall region of the Royal Pigeon Racing Association and is 29th out of 500 racers in the region!While pigeons are inextricably linked to the working class of the North, and of South Wales, today’s 20,000 members come from all over the UK, all backgrounds and include more and more women.The Queen is one of the industry’s most enthusiastic fanciers and recently spent £40,000 on a new loft at Sandringham for her 200 pedigree birds. Heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson has long been a passionate pigeon fancier and pins the start of his boxing career on the moment someone ripped the head off one of his prize birds, and he punched him, hard.The jewel bird in the Cook collection is Princess Pao, an 11-year-old who came second in a 600-mile race from Pau in southern France and has just laid a clutch of two eggs. The offspring, when weaned in 51 days, could fetch up to £2,000 a pop.Two thousand pounds! For a pigeon? But seemingly that’s nothing. James reminds me of Armando — nicknamed ‘the Lionel Messi of pigeons’ — which was sold last year for £1 million to a Chinese buyer and is now enjoying life as a feathered stud muffin.‘His racing days are over. Would you want to risk letting a million-dollar pigeon out?’ says James.Because however brilliant they are, some fly into power cables and turbines, others are picked off by birds of prey, some die from exhaustion and others mutiny and throw their lot in with the feral flying rats. Which means that the wait by the coop in the hours, often days, after release is the worst bit.‘Sometimes they’re shattered, sometimes you’d have thought they’d just flown round the garden,’ says Derek. ‘I had one come back. She couldn’t quite make it to the lofts — she dropped a few feet short and I had to pick her up, she couldn’t go any further.’His eyes suddenly look rheumy. ‘To think, a little thing like that can fly for 580 miles. In a day. It makes your heart pump.’Elizabeth is rather more sanguine: ‘Of course, I worry they are not going to come back, but I am excited to see if they win. Sometimes you lose one. It’s sad, but it’s just one of those things.’"},{"url":null,"title":"VE Day parties people drop guard caused coronavirus cases spike","story":"Share this articleUK hospital closes A\u0026ampE and no longer accepting new patients due to high number of coronavirus cases | The IndependentHospital forced to close A\u0026ampE ‘because of spike in coronavirus cases caused by people celebrating VE Day’ – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"BBQs garden socialising friends family bubbles green light month","story":"Share this articlePubs urge Government to cut two-metre social distancing rule to one metre so they can open up – The SunGarden parties and barbecues to be allowed next month, raising hopes people will see their parents again"},{"url":null,"title":"Waiting times pedestrian crossings HALVED lockdown","story":"Share this articleCouncils cut pedestrian crossing waiting times to help with social distancing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ecb5b8afbb1197d37d96eeef53be51485a0c039/0_731_1413_847/master/1413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2bcfd7797daa793c7c3f3ff6a70b99","title":"its brought home the value of these roles lockdowns private sector heroes","story":"When the UK population was told to stay indoors, one maintenance team in Chester refused to let people in need of vital supplies go without. Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

If we were ever tempted to view those post-industrial years in political black and white, Biaolobrzeski’s pictures insist on colouring them in.

The first paragraph described a Japanese supermarket’s cacophony – tinkling door chime, voices, scanner beeps. I’d been to Tokyo and loved those sounds and there it was, that embrace.I kept reading, and kept seeing myself in the narrator. All her life, Japanese convenience store worker Keiko Furukura has had to teach herself how to behave around others. She’s relieved when her head office trainer guides her: “It was the first time anyone had ever taught me how to accomplish a normal facial expression and manner of speech.” She pretends to share co-workers’ petty irritations, and is serenely oblivious to gossip. When patronised, she only really cares about the logic: yes, yes, that was rude, but was it well argued? I’m autistic, and this is all very me.I’d thought my brain was too different to appear in a novel, but there I was. I smiled whenever I recognised an experience, which meant I basically smiled for the whole book.Keiko never clocks off from acting “normal”. For her and for me, socialising isn’t “leisure”. It’s more work, and there’s no manual. Employers are narrow-minded (“If I ever became a foreign object, I’d no doubt be eliminated.”), but so are most people, or they’d stop requiring us to mimic them. Keiko feels lonely in the way I often do: not because we lack company, but because praise for a persona that we cultivate for others suggests that no one loves our real self.This sentence floored me: “She’s far happier thinking her sister is normal, even if she has a lot of problems, than she is having an abnormal sister for whom everything is fine.” That’s why I squash my emotions in public. I can’t be happy, because if I do then my voice will go monotone and I’ll forget to make the right faces. I can’t get excited because then I’ll start flapping my hands. I need to really trust someone before I can let myself feel anything around them, since I know from robust trial and error that many people will mock my spectrum traits. Keiko’s words made me feel that in my throat: the repression, and some of what I use to cover it.It’s easy to see Keiko as a late-capitalist stooge, but I don’t read Convenience Store Woman as an interrogation of alienated labour. To me, the novel says that if one play-acts everywhere, it’s freeing to have a script. I’d never seen that in fiction: no schmaltzy girl-boss pipe dreams, just bald awareness that all human integration requires pretence if society finds you weird. I loved Keiko. She got it.Then I read the reviews. Apparently Keiko is “chilling”, “an oddball” and “latently psychopathic”. The book is “depraved” and a form of “horror”, this last because our heroine has a low-paid job. Warn the townspeople.For my part, I was entirely Team Keiko. Yes, as a child Keiko bashes two boys with a spade to stop them fighting but she’s using the boys’ own tool – physical force – to achieve a desired outcome. Yes, Keiko sees a dead bird in the park and is confused by her family’s mawkish desire to bury it when they could simply grill it for dinner but what distinguishes this bird from the other birds they eat? Yes, Keiko muses that despite the hassle of soothing her infant nephew, it would be easier to stop his cries by stabbing him with a cake knife but she’s only observing. Is she wrong? Can you think of a quicker way? Leave Keiko alone!I was with her through hell and yakitori. Our thoughts were so similar that no other difference mattered. I’m in my 20s and Keiko’s in her 30s, I’m Irish and she’s Japanese, I like sex and she doesn’t but we were as one on the cake knife question.It puzzles me when people complain of not having “connected” with a protagonist. I can’t speak for anyone else on the spectrum, but I don’t always need to see myself in books. I’m not saying that I never side with characters. I feel close to Jean Rhys’s bad women, Evelyn Waugh’s fractured Catholics, Helen Oyeyemi’s escapists, Oscar Wilde’s caustic queers. But while I’m pleased when I relate, I’m not dissatisfied if I don’t. Characters usually think and act in ways I find alien. If I needed to bond with them then I’d rarely enjoy fiction. That’s not because I “lack empathy”. Non-autistics would feel as I do about “identifying” if most books were about me and not them.Still, I loved Keiko for those “Me!” moments.I try to read generously, and Convenience Store Woman has helped me to approach other novels on fairer terms. When you recognise an experience in a book, an experience you had been looking for everywhere else to no avail, then it becomes easier to accept that most books weren’t trying to depict that experience in the first place. They’re still worth reading, those books, but the rewards lie elsewhere.Better yet, Convenience Store Woman has given me confidence in my own work. I write to allow myself one place, just one, where I can use my mind as it is instead of corseting it to look like other people’s. My debut novel, Exciting Times, isn’t about my life but it came from my brain, so it reflects how I process the world. I needed Keiko, and I never would have found her if her creator had pandered to “universality”. So I’ll keep writing from my interior, and other authors can write from theirs. Some books teach us about ourselves. Others teach us that not everyone’s the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2319a366952574a2a698a6174776750460fd34/0_152_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dc03b5fb6b38e41476f85f0816658fb","title":"rogue civil service tweet uk","story":"The UK government is to investigate who called it ‘arrogant and offensive’. But the person should be treated as a whistleblowerIt wasn’t me, but I can probably speak for most of the 400,000-odd civil servants when I say I wish it had been. The (presumed) rogue official whose hastily deleted tweet on the government’s official Civil Service account certainly lit up the WhatsApp groups around Whitehall on Sunday evening. In an age of increasing command-and-control comms, this brave heretic has already become something of a civil service legend. Very well played.Consider. “Arrogant and offensive. Can you imagine working with these truth twisters?” wasn’t a leaked document, a shocking secret or a devastating meme. It was a simple, excoriating judgment of the prime minister’s incoherent defence of Dominic Cummings that not even Larry the Downing Street cat would disagree with.This was speaking truth to power. This was a shot across the bow. This was a tiny flare sent up from the government trenches, in solidarity with anyone who has ever felt like they’ve been “sent over the top” by an implacable ruling class for whom the rules themselves are increasingly a disposable commodity.Sure, that account might have been hacked, but to me its brevity and its polite lucidity reek of authenticity and suggests the act of a single brave inidual.The Cabinet Office quickly announced that the tweet had been deleted, and that it was launching an investigation into what happened. But I hope they never find its author. And if they do, I’d argue that he or she should qualify for the protection that the government by law has to provide for whistleblowers, who, after all, are allowed to break government omertà when there are miscarriages of justice, fraud, dangers to health and safety, or attempts to conceal any of the above.That kind of argument probably won’t be enough to convince any future employment tribunal that this anonymous hero was justified in breaking the civil service code, but it’s a hell of a lot stronger than the arguments deployed in defence of Cummings. If there’s any justice, if my colleague is uncovered, he or she will face the same consequences as the prime minister’s chief adviser did, which will be bugger all (although Durham police might have other ideas).What is sad and damaging about this particular lockdown clusterbourach is not just the additional pressure now placed on public health messaging, but about the deteriorating trust in government, its conventions and its institutions.There is now no longer even the pretence that the British public are currently governed by the law of moral equivalence – the radical idea that whatever is wrong for you must also be wrong for me.Civil servants aren’t naive – we know that no politician is above appealing to exceptionalism of one kind or another. But the sheer amounts of it that have been enthusiastically spaffed by the cabinet and the prime minister in defence of Cummings over the past couple of days have shocked, dismayed and enraged the public and civil servants alike.As ever, it’s not the rule-breaking itself that hurts us, it’s the lack of concern about the damage being done to cover it up. Only time and the public inquiry that is surely coming down the line will tell the true extent of this. It’s entirely plausible that the undermining of the lockdown rules so carefully set out by public health officials may yet be counted in lives lost.Meanwhile, the sobering reality for the civil service twitterer is that the Cabinet Office praetorian guard will spend more energy trying to identify them than it ever will on investigating Cummings’s lockdown misdeeds. The hunt may now be on, but the resistance continues.• The civil servant works in a Whitehall department"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6648d5e485aa682702b58918b38387a7a84041ae/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f3c98076810c27aefbc810f713d2845","title":"the guardian view on dominic cummings time to go","story":"The prime minister’s chief adviser broke the lockdown and shows no regret in doing so. He should not stay on advising a government that needs the public to abide by the rulesThe prime minister’s chief adviser should be leaving Downing Street for good, not be giving press conferences from its rose garden. Unlike millions of Britons who stayed at home for the sake of collective safety of the country, Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown in March. While the rest of the UK was inconvenienced, suffered hardship and lost loved ones without saying goodbye, Mr Cummings drove 260 miles to his parents’ farm in Durham after his wife fell sick.Mr Cummings and his wife had not been tested for coronavirus. Neither of them appear to have been seriously incapacitated at the same time. They had one small child who needed looking after. These were unfortunate circumstances, not exceptional ones. Many, many people dealt with far worse. What Mr Cummings cannot seem to fathom is that if everyone considers their circumstances to be unusual, and decides that they can move around the country in search of childcare, then the virus will spread across households, and across communities, and the pandemic will grow, and many lives will be lost as a result.The message in this health emergency to the public was clear: “stay at home”. For Mr Cummings the message appeared to be to “read the small print” and find a reasonable excuse not to. The lack of self-awareness is galling. The exemption that Mr Cummings rests his argument on was developed for people at risk of domestic abuse. Legal experts suggest that Mr Cummings’ defence would not stand up in a court of law, let alone that of public opinion. It is a stretch to think that the lockdown would allow people with what appeared to be coronavirus symptoms to leave their home and drive to another part of the country. Or to allow them to end up in a hospital hundreds of miles away from their house.Mr Cummings’ actions have the government in crisis. But the country is in the grip of a coronavirus pandemic. What has been asked of people is to make sacrifices for the collective wellbeing. This requires a high level of cooperation and trust. Most people understood that they had to stay inside during the lockdown and believed that others would do the same. They might not have done so if people like Mr Cummings had been given official backing to cheat these reciprocal arrangements.There is a long way to go. In the coming weeks the British public is likely be asked to endure more restrictions for the greater good. It is hoped that they will ignore Mr Cummings’ example and not bend or stretch the rules but carry on obeying them both in letter and in spirit. Because this is about protecting the lives of one’s family and one’s community. The virus is being spread by people who think, like Mr Cummings, that the rules do not apply to them. This is why he ought not to remain at the heart of the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec76084b6dbd5e6ecdbbfd83a344060811f7db3/0_0_2079_1248/master/2079.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=25d2a01ce257002f466a9dd753979e8a","title":"a look at the worlds most stylish men in pictures","story":"The Staley-Wise Gallery in New York is currently closed, but has plundered its archives to curate an online exhibition celebrating some of the world’s best-dressed men.

I don’t support the documentary, I don’t agree with its message and I don’t like the misleading use of facts in its narrative.”Planet of the Humans director Jeff Gibbs said he was working with YouTube to resolve the issue and have the film back up as soon as possible.He said in a statement: “This attempt to take down our film and prevent the public from seeing it is a blatant act of censorship by political critics of Planet of the Humans. It is a misuse of copyright law to shut down a film that has opened a serious conversation about how parts of the environmental movement have gotten into bed with Wall Street and so-called “green capitalists.” There is absolutely no copyright violation in my film. This is just another attempt by the film’s opponents to subvert the right to free speech.”Planet of the Humans, which has been seen by more than 8 million people since it was launched online last month, describes itself as a “full-frontal assault” on the sacred cows of the environmental movement.Veteran climate campaigners and thinkers, such as Bill McKibben and George Monbiot, have pointed out factual errors, outdated footage and promotion of myths about renewable energy propagated by the fossil fuel industry. Many are dismayed that Moore – who built his reputation as a left-wing filmmaker and supporter of civil rights – should produce a work endorsed by climate sceptics and right-wing thinktanks.Several have signed a letter urging the removal of what they called a “shockingly misleading and absurd” documentary. Climate scientist Michael Mann said the filmmakers “have done a grave disservice to us and the planet” with distortions, half-truths and lies.On Moore’s official YouTube channel, the usual link to the film has been replaced by a page noting “Video unavailable. This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by a third party.” On the Planet of the Humans website, the link to the full movie is also dead, though the trailers and other video material are functioning as normal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06a6008d32aec47d5730bab698f5cf4116332739/0_160_4521_2713/master/4521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f321b2fb2b5004bb1a8c634fc7f0901","title":"just add chocolate or dates or banana 10 delicious flapjack recipes to suit every taste","story":"Sweet, comforting and endlessly flexible, flapjack is the perfect lockdown bake. Whether you’re a vegan, a hipster or a millionaire, we’ve got you coveredPerhaps I am over-generalising, but I feel that the flapjack rarely migrates from the home economics class into everyday adult life. Yet at this moment, it hits all the notes: it is wholesome, very simple, you can bake it with children and you can throw any old nonsense in to no obvious ill effect. Plus, it needs no flour, which is great if you can’t get hold of any, and oats are incredibly good value. There is no kitchen alchemy involving things that have a habit of going wrong – no raising agent, no uncertainty from adding an egg.I tried every which way, with the “help” of an outrageously careless 10-year-old, to get one wrong, just for the suspense. There were rumours that tin size was important, that the wrong dimensions messed with the texture. It is true that a thinner flapjack will have a more biscuity, less squidgy mouthfeel, but biscuity is still fine, otherwise why would people eat biscuits? It is also true that the finer the oats, the more they hold together in the finished product, but even jumbo oats didn’t fall apart as I had been led to believe. But if this really worries you, you can make them finer by whizzing them first in a food processor, anyway.Having said that all flapjacks are equally good, it would be contradictory to claim that these are the 10 best: think of them, rather, as a flapjack for every taste.The Pooh Cook Book, loosely based on the sensibilities of Winnie the Pooh, came out in 1971: if you were born between then and about 1985, it will have provided the building blocks of your first cooking experiences even if you never read it. Trust me, I was there.Anyway, its flapjack – 50g butter, 50g sugar, 100g oats, one tablespoon of golden syrup, pinch of salt, 160C (140C fan350Fgas mark 3) for 20 minutes – is basically a ration-book version of the classic recipe (generally, there is more fat than oats), and, with a much smaller yield, that should be enough for two hungry children. That’s what really stands out about recipes written before the 90s, how incredibly small they are.You want perfection, go to the person whose middle name it is: our own Felicity Cloake identified the two fundamental schools of flapjackery as crunchy or chewy, and comes down, herself, very firmly on the side of crunchy. Much more syrup than sugar in this one, and she’s quite strict on the size of the oats, 50:50 jumbo to rolled, but the main way to assure more crunch is a shallower baking tray in a hotter oven.Baking genius Dan Lepard was unaccountably looking for a way to reduce the fat and sugar content of a flapjack, and discovered that even a small amount of tahini - 75g – had a fudgifying effect on the other ingredients, which reduced the need for both butter and sugar. The ingredients list – featuring dates, walnuts, sesame seeds, honey – means it isn’t for someone looking for something simple, but will be ideal if you want to winnow your weird stockpiles.There are variations of this recipe all over Instagram, though I have found no reputable chef that would put their name to them: the no-dairy, no-sugar, no-nuffink flapjack. Basically, you take mashed banana and oats of any size in roughly equal quantities before you mix them, toast the oats in a frying pan with enough coconut oil to coat, then add the banana and some kind of nut or seed butter (or more coconut oil, if you’re minded).You can add as much dried fruit as you think it’ll take without falling apart. And these have to be baked in biscuits, rather than squares, because they’re too mouth-drying otherwise, but they work surprisingly well, I think due to the initial toasting of the oats, which brings depth of flavour.My small and I agreed, though, that they just weren’t sweet enough, and tried again twice with golden syrup and agave. The golden syrup was the best. For a two-banana mix, I added in two tablespoons but feel free to adjust to taste.The industrialised flapjack has a very distinctive texture which, like shop-bought chocolate cake, is incredibly hard to replicate at home. That’s fine if you’re dead proud of your home baking, but not if you actually prefer the shop version. The answer came, unexpectedly, from a recipe shared by Anna Botting (the Sky presenter) on Twitter: condensed milk. She uses the unsweetened version, but I am obsessed with the regular stuff, and can attest, these have a wonderful shop-bought squidge and also taste like condensed milk.Not a traditionally Scottish snack, just from the marvellous Scottish Baking by Sue Lawrence: it’s a versatile recipe that basically lets you add anything you happen to have around, raisins, apricots, coconut, flaked almonds, whatever, and is also the only one that uses any flour. Even in a small amount, it makes them a bit more cake-like.Flapjacks are about as rich as life gets, and yet you can heap richness upon them to create something 10 times richer, but just as delicious. Like this BBC Good Food recipe for chocolate and caramel flapjacks. It’s the kind of maths that only the flapjack truly understands, just as only Jeff Bezos understands why you’d want to be a trillionaire when you’re already a billionaire.The Birmingham-based, mostly vegan but not inflexibly so Domestic Gothess fancied up the classic recipe here with coconut and ginger, and if you can overcome your inner purist, I have to say, these are the most interesting. The flavour still has a lot of clarity, it just sounds a few more notes.Almost all recipes that suggest any seeds and nuts will allow for infinite variations this BBC Good Food one is seeds only. Mainly, this is because you’re not really trying to pick out finer flavour differences between a pumpkin and a sunflower seed, you’re looking for more crunch, more textural variety and the overall impression of a more grownup snack.

The ripping drive down the autostrada del sole, motorway of sun, to Naples the overnight ferry to Palermo or Catania the first thick coffee the trip to the market to get a picnic for the journey to my partner’s family home. There is nothing special or unusual about a looping thought of getting away for a holiday the evocation of heat, saltwater or cold beer.At the moment, in Rome, the smells and tastes of Sicily are vivid to me, almost rudely so, amplified by my imagination, a cassette played through 120W amps, with distortion. The walk from Catania fish market back to the car park is always a smell-driven journey: it means passing under a bridge banked with rubbish, then past a man tending charcoal grills full of blackened pepper and onions. Writing this now, the smells of fermenting rubbish and scorched onions are as real and intrusive as the smell of the alcohol-bleach mixture my neighbour squeezes into the cracks on the communal staircase to kill “the virus”.I think the virus my neighbour chases with a cloth is the reason for my amplified senses. I have not been alone, I don’t think, in my almost tick-like checking for symptoms in the past few months: cough and temperature, obviously, but also smell and taste. I reassure myself I am fine, having the most exaggerated sense of both: coffee, fish bones, flowers, bleach, the uncovered cheese, sour milk, the rubbish in our courtyard, strawberries, baked onions.The man working the grill in Catania tends whole onions, baking them in their skins until they are completely charred on the outside. Inside, however, they are soft, with opaque layers that flump out when you peel away the outside, ready to be dressed with oil and red-wine vinegar. Other things found on Sicilian grills are le stigghiole – lamb’s intestines wound round spring onions then grilled over charcoal – and cipollate catanesi, pancetta wrapped around spring onions. Both are referred to as arrusti e mangia, roast and eat, and can be made just as easily in a garden or a kitchen.Most spring onions have bulbs the size of an olive they are ideal for this. If they are a passing-round snack, estimate three per person if they are part of a larger grill spread, two. I don’t bother trimming the spring onions, leaving all the green intact, plus the little stringy root, which provides a handle of sorts and can be bitten off.Simply wash the onions and pat them dry. For every onion, you need a thin rasher of pancetta, which is salt-cured pork belly. Streaky bacon works here, too. Wrap the rasher around the onion as if it were a ribbon round a maypole, so at a bias, covering the bottom two-thirds of the onion this leaves the greenery sticking out at one end and half the fat bulb peeping out at the other. Rub with olive oil and it is ready to cook.Most of the time, we cook this over white-hot charcoal in our small, bandy fornacella, which means we are on the flat concrete roof of my partner’s grandparents’ house in Sicily. I have also cooked them in an aluminium tray barbecue, in a friend’s pizza oven, on an iron griddle pan, in a frying pan, under the grill and in the oven. There are many options. Wherever you cook them, the heat needs to be intense (but not flaming), so the fatty pancetta melts then crisps, the slender onion cooks underneath and both ends char until black. A great part of the pleasure of onions and pancetta is the smell of the catching and the scorching, arrusti, then the mess of eating with your fingers, wherever you are or wherever that takes you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c070469400b953df02779112789ff7497dda8607/0_10_1784_1070/master/1784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c02fda891766862656247d88540e28d8","title":"job simulation games farming trucking bus driving","story":"From farming to trucking to bus driving, why do millions play games that replicate regular jobs in forensic detail?There is no escape for me this time. The rear axle of my pick-up truck is wedged on a boulder protruding from the mud in the middle of a deserted backwater road in Michigan. I’ve tried to attach a winch to a nearby tree to pull myself out, but it’s not working. I will have to abandon the vehicle, fit up another and try again. This load of timber is not going to deliver itself.I am playing Snowrunner, the latest in a series of painstakingly authentic offroad delivery simulator games in which players have to haul goods through a variety of unforgiving landscapes at speeds that would shame a garden snail. Before each trip you have to select exactly the right vehicle for the job, fit the correct tyres and work out your likely fuel consumption to the nearest millilitre. On the frozen roads of northern Alaska, there is no room for shoddy planning.Over the last five years there has been a renaissance in serious job simulator games. Titles such as Euro Truck Simulator, Bus Simulator and Train Sim World have attracted huge fanbases and critical acclaim, each replicating its profession with unremitting attention to detail. In an entertainment sector where ludicrous power fantasies rule, where players get to be space marines, ancient warrior princesses and football superstars, it seems antithetical that 25 million people have bought Farming Simulator, a game in which your main challenge is to harvest a successful wheat crop.But it is the very precision of these games that has attracted such a devoted following. “Throughout development we gather a lot of questions,” says Julian Mautner at Stillalive studios, the team behind the Bus Simulator games. “When you turn the ignition key once, which functions of the bus actually work, and which icons on the dashboard light up? What happens afterwards when you turn it into second position? These are the details our players really care about.”According to Mautner, the studio has a partnership with its local transport company, IVB (Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe), which they regularly visit to inspect real-life buses and take hundreds of pictures. “We also talk to the bus drivers about their everyday challenges, about special situations or tricky manoeuvres they had to execute,” he says. “That provides us with immensely valuable insights into the workings of a transportation company.”Meanwhile, the coders accurately simulate all aspects of engine performance – gear changing, torque, acceleration – using information from manufacturers. The audio team makes more than 1,000 recordings of sounds from all around different buses. The artists recreate interiors exactly. As Mautner explains: “Nowadays we aim to get actual 3D data for the cockpits, because replicating the details from images and blueprints often led to small inaccuracies that the community noted.”The landscapes are vitally important, too. With truck and train driving simulators much of the appeal is the scenery that whizzes past as you’re hauling goods from Berlin to Bonne, or driving a Great Western train to Cornwall. “Real-world references are essential for the world creation,” says Ondrej Dufek, a project leader at SCS Software, the creators of Euro Truck Simulator and American Truck Simulator. “Google Earth, Maps and Street View are a vital tools and sources of photo references. On YouTube, there are also videos from truckers who drive across various states and countries, commenting on their surroundings and pointing out interesting stuff. Information about elevation, economy, industries, markets, traffic density, freight routes, weather, even demographics – everything is important and helps us decide what roads and cities to put in our world.”“Sometimes we’ll take photos straight against a wall so our artists can see what kind of brick is being used,” says Matt Peddlestone, a senior producer at Dovetail Games which makes Train Sim World. “As you go down a route, the supplier of the brick changes because the bricks are being made locally and the colours of the building will change. We want to capture that.”It’s easy to think of hardcore sim fans as pernickety obsessives, but there is a quiet joy in interacting with these lovingly replicated systems of lights, switches and signals. In an unpredictable world, it is calming to open the doors of a bus at the right time, to give the correct change, to set the heating system correctly, to obey the traffic signs. It is gratifying to see a button, to press it and to know something will happen.“I play simulators because by their nature they are internally consistent,” says fan Melissa Harper. “If you’re playing a game and you’re in a cockpit, and you can’t press all the buttons, that absolutely slaughters the experience for me. But in Microsoft Flight Simulator, you can press all the buttons, and they all do something. That’s SO satisfying, and then you can learn what they all do.”Her favourite example is the ultra hardcore Stormworks: Build and Rescue, where you run your own sea rescue service. “It’s the most brutal game I’ve ever played,” she enthuses. “You have to make the whole plane yourself – and all those hundreds of buttons? You have to place them by hand! The developers just toss you into a ridiculously complicated editor and say, ‘Hey, it’s only aircraft propulsion and electrical engineering, how hard could it be? F*** you.’ It is my favourite game.”All the simulation developers I spoke to know that some of their players are professionals in the field being simulated. The Train Sim World creators are quickly told when a siding has been placed in slightly the wrong position, or if a certain signal outside Stratford never shows a green light, only ever yellow because that’s the way it’s been wired. “Drivers send us tips,” says Dufek. “What truck stops and unique landmarks we should include, which parts of the roads are infamous for their difficulty (steep climbs, mountain passes).”Beyond all this, simulators have an emotional and nostalgic value. Train Sim World lets players drive historical trains and journeys, which has allowed retired drivers to rediscover routes they once travelled every day. Fishing: Barents Sea Simulator was inspired by the life of co-creator Goran Myrland’s grandfather, a fisherman in 1950s Norway. “He owned a classic boat just like the Follabuen, which is in our game,” says Yasemin Hamurcu, COO at Misc Games. “He spent months with his crew on the rough sea to find the best catch, to earn money and provide for his family. His wife always worried about him, hoping he would come home safely.”I have friends who drive for hours in Euro Truck Simulator, using the game’s real in-game radio app to pick up local stations. For me, Snowrunner has been almost hypnotic – it’s given me longer to take in the scenery, to get the feel of rural North America. Many players aren’t here for the authenticity of the equipment of the simulation minutiae they’re here to experience a landscape in their own way, in their own time. A slow and steady escape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ba55dcda30b56ec5ac531f7d24a1e413c7f483/0_36_887_532/master/887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c911165f5081655ce8a7e0dc3f09ef0","title":"how we met hes so brave i once saw him climb into a tree to save a black mamba","story":"Jenny Botting, 33, and Arend Van Blerk, 31, both primatologists, met in the South African bush.

In the evenings, Jenny stayed up late to speak to him. “I was so tired from getting up at 4am for work, but I pretended I wasn’t so I could spend time with Arend,” she says. He felt the same way. “I thought she was really attractive but we also shared a lot of interests. She was silly in a cute way and I really enjoyed talking to her.”The pair had their first kiss at the volunteers’ Saturday night party a week after they met. They spent the next few months together before Jenny moved back to Scotland to start her PhD at the University of St Andrews. “It was the first time we were going to be apart and it all felt so uncertain,” says Arend. They kept their relationship going long distance and the following April, Jenny got the chance to return to South Africa for field research. “As part of my PhD, I went back every April for the next few years. It meant I could spend more than half the year with Arend doing research there,” she says. During the winters, they spoke on the phone whenever they could.In September 2016, Jenny was offered a two-year research post in the US at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington DC. “It was really hard because it meant we had to be apart for longer,” she says. “But it was my dream job.” The couple were used to long-distance love by this point, and travelled together when they got the chance. “The first time I travelled long-haul was to see Jenny in the UK in 2016. One of the things I love about our relationship is that she has opened my eyes to seeing the world,” says Arend. During her time in the States, he went to visit the zoo she was working at. “I got to introduce him to my orangutans and gorillas,” she says. “We are both so passionate about animals and working with them.”Jenny moved back to South Africa in June 2018 to live with Arend, their cat and three dogs. “We love scuba ing, hiking and taking regular game drives together,” she says. They got engaged in February this year. “I actually proposed on Valentine’s Day in the Cape of Good Hope. We don’t usually celebrate it and I’d actually forgotten it was that day,” laughs Arend. Straight after the proposal they ran into a group of baboons. “It made it extra special, although it might reinforce the fact that our lives seem to revolve around animals,” jokes Jenny. After that she came back to see her family and friends in Windsor. “The pandemic hit while I was here and the South African borders were closed so we are living apart again.” Despite the current challenges, the pair hope to marry “as soon as possible”.Jenny says she loves Arend’s sense of humour and his kindness towards people and animals. “He’s so brave. I once saw him climb into a tree to save a black mamba. I love how he cares for all animals equally, whether it’s a tiny bug or an elephant.” Arend appreciates his partner’s passion and bravery. “If she sees something bad happening, she’ll always address it,” he says. He also loves their differences. “We’ve grown up in different environments and it’s great to get another perspective. Whatever happens, she can always make me feel better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b811ae0839abcedc3ff8d13874c11bc7","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e457b4bb6489ede39631021c6a84d48a899246ea/0_0_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8647e89f63aa5df5840a7dabc5a8fc15","title":"best way composting council food waste","story":"My local council has stopped collecting food waste and I’m not sure what I need to compost itEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.My local council has stopped collecting food waste and I think I need to start composting.

If a company isn’t “made in Yorkshire”, it doesn’t go in the fund.The asset management company behind it said the tide was turning against globalisation in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and this was a way for people from Yorkshire – as well as other investors – “to grow their savings while supporting local home-grown industry”.But a fund where people’s money is being invested in a relatively small number of companies in just one region will inevitably involve more risk and volatility than one that spreads the cash more widely. And while this is open to iniduals and firms, the minimum investment of £20,000 will put it out of many small investors’ reach.Mole Valley Asset Management (Mvam), whose regional office is based in York, said it believed this was the first fund of its type and would only invest in 20 listed companies based in Yorkshire.The first wave of firms include Wetherby-based biotech firm Avacta, which made the headlines a few days ago because it is developing a 10-minute home saliva test for coronavirus that will be similar to a pregnancy test.Another of the 20 companies is Zoo Digital, which has bases in Sheffield, London, Los Angeles and Dubai. It specialises in subtitling and dubbing and is pioneering digital technology in the entertainment industry.Duncan Sanford, who heads up Mvam’s York office, said that while there was always going to be an appetite for investment in global companies, “we’ve seen the tide starting to turn for some time, with people looking increasingly to be part of their local economies”.“We can only see that counter-globalisation drive increasing post-Covid-19 as people reassess their priorities in all aspects of their lives. And if they are increasingly looking to shop local, why not invest local as well?” he said.More than 80 companies that have head offices in Yorkshire are listed on the stock market, from luxury food producers and digital gaming companies to property firms and healthcare equipment minnows, according to Mvam.“There is so much potential in this area – in industries from digital to creative and pharmaceutical – it’s hard to choose, but we believe what we have come up with is an excellent group of listed firms which are either already hugely successful or, in many cases, about to break through,” Sanford said.It emerged on 21 May that Avacta had signed a distribution agreement with a venture set up by the billionaire co-founder of online fashion brand Boohoo to sell its coronavirus instant testing kits to consumers.Alastair Smith, Avacta’s chief executive, said of being included in the portfolio: “I’m a Yorkshireman myself, and many of our employees based at our Wetherby lab and head office are local, so it’s great to have a showcase like this for the innovation and entrepreneurship going on in Yorkshire.”Mvam highlights the high-risk nature of the actively managed fund on its website: “We would not advocate putting your entire wealth in such a portfolio. While the rewards can be high, so can the risks.”It said this was partly because the companies in the fund could be small in size, adding: “The portfolio is concentrated, holding 20 companies, and therefore has additional company specific risk.” The £20,000 minimum investment was “considerably lower than the thresholds for other directly managed portfolios with exclusive access to the portfolio manager”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/053313fb5278573ce83033a8fbfae9a50d263b36/0_81_2652_1592/master/2652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d01d09583c40e0b7336b91c14091cbe","title":"rian evans poulenc pinocchio boesman beethoven schoenberg","story":"In our new series, critics tell us about the music they’re listening to at home, from symphonies to live streams, grand opera to guilty pleasures. This week, Rian Evans moves from Poulenc to Pinocchio, and rolls over BeethovenMy corona-listening is a mix of random v planned. Switching on BBC Radio 3, but missing the beginning of a piece, is one kind of random. The fabulous viola tone in Schoenberg’s intense String Trio (on BBC Sounds until 11 June) turned out to be that of Lawrence Power – I should have guessed – playing with Ilya Gringolts and Daniel Haefliger. Hitting on Poulenc’s Concerto for Two Pianos, with Shin-Heae Kang and her mentor Marta Argerich as soloists with the NDR Radio Philharmonic Orchestra was another plus (on BBC Sounds until 12 June).Poulenc embraces extremes, so an air of contemplation is never far from an irresistible joie de vivre and, here, a Mozartian vein coalesces with unmistakably Poulencian harmony. The composer himself often performed this work with Jacques Février, but how intriguing to discover that he gave the first London performance with Benjamin Britten in January 1945. They must surely have talked Balinese gamelan music, whose inflections colour the first movement. Roger Nichols’ new book will doubtless elucidate.That concerto sent me searching for the Poulenc cantata premiered by the BBC Singers in London in March. Figure Humaine, for double choir, sets eight poems by Paul Éluard: fast and brilliant alternates with slower and sad, culminating in his paean Liberté, a final tour de force. This single poem was recognised as being so important that, in 1942, the RAF dropped copies to the resistance in France, a symbolic gesture of fraternité and egalité that seems a world away from today’s insular rhetoric.Recent talk of Pinocchio and his nose demanded that I look out Philippe Boesman’s opera based on Carlo Collodi’s fairytale of the wooden boy. Collodi intended his original allegory to have political edge and Joël Pommerat’s 2017 Aix-en-Provence staging made it darker again, underlining the conflict between fiction and reality, lies and truth. But, frankly, for all that Chloé Briot’s Pinocchio was sung with great panache, I found the puppet a bit too ADHD for comfort and gave up on it.Now’s the moment to say a big thank you for the techno-wizardry giving us a different kind of “live” and, across media platforms, demonstrating musicians’ ingenuity and adaptability. Audio-visual artist Kathy Hinde organised the 840 requisite iterations of Erik Satie’s Vexations to mark the composer’s 154th birthday on 17 May (so successful that another is planned for 12 June). The repetitions were soothing rather than vexatious. Llŷr Williams should have been performing Beethoven’s 32 piano sonatas in Mexico this month: instead, Signum has engineered it to beam the cycle direct from his home in North Wales. It’s been remarkable playing thus far. There are three recitals left – 29 May, 1 and 3 June – with Ops 109, 110 and 111 triptych closing the series.Fundamental as Beethoven is, by way of antidote to potential anniversary overload, I also bop in the kitchen to a tape of Chuck Berry. The first track is Roll Over Beethoven. No guilt involved, though best blot out his “I got a rockin’ pneumonia” line…Rian’s pick for the coming weekI’ll be watching Rimsky-Korsakov’s The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, considered his operatic masterpiece, a “Russian Parsifal”. Telling of love and war, heaven and hell, the possibilities of redemption and utopian paradise, it covers most bases. Meanwhile, Invisible Cities is the title of Charlotte Bray’s four-movement work for viola and piano, where she takes Italo Calvino’s 1972 novel as the impulse for making musically connecting threads, encouraging us to do the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb6918fad719d74c29cfce407b182bf7162582c/0_136_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1f6798d055eb8cf8d516227fdd916d","title":"cummings and not goings","story":"The prime minister’s senior adviser has provoked national outrage by admitting travelling hundreds of miles to stay with family at the height of coronavirus lockdown. ’s Matthew Weaver reveals how he helped break the storyDominic Cummings has given his version of the events that have dominated the news for the past five days.

In retrospect, many will ask whether he was just trying to beat the traffic.Over the last 72 hours, Downing Street officials, unnamed sources and ministers have attempted to cast doubt on parts of the timeline of Cummings’s travels.But an examination of the public record, placed alongside the  and Daily Mirror’s reporting, means that it is possible to lay out the significant claims and counter-claims of the period in question – and where questions still remain.On the day Cummings ran out of No 10, his wife, Mary Wakefield, appears to have been already ill, according to her Spectator article about the experience, in which she says: “My husband did rush home to look after me.” The article did not mention that soon after he rushed home, the family went to the other end of the country.The government has briefed that Cummings travelled north before developing symptoms of the virus, which is said to have struck him over the weekend of 28-29 March.Wakefield wrote that Cummings said “I feel weird” and collapsed 24 hours after he came home to look after her, placing their journey north on Friday – perhaps trying to beat the weekend getaway – or Saturday at the latest.The details of the journey from London remain unclear.Did he drive or take the train? On Sunday, the cabinet minister Grant Shapps didn’t know. He was asked whether Cummings had stopped for a break at any point on the four-hour journey accompanied by a small child and a sick wife.Despite being given notice of the question by Sky’s Sophy Ridge the evening before, and having been in contact with Cummings, Shapps was caught flat-footed. “I’m afraid I don’t have detail to the point of what time of day, and how many stops,” he said, adding that he was “expert” in transport matters and would prefer to talk about the A66.In its defence of Cummings, No 10 said the couple had had to travel north in search of childcare from Cummings’s sister and nieces at the property owned by his parents.The former Downing Street director of communications Alastair Campbell, among others, described this as guff. He said it was unbelievable that Cummings had to travel 264 miles to get help with childcare.But, in the end, Cummings and his wife did not need childcare, No 10 have said, instead relying on the family to deliver food to their door.The police have said that on 31 March they were “made aware of reports” of Cummings’s presence in the area.On Friday, Durham Constabulary told the  and Daily Mirror that they had then contacted the family to “reiterate the appropriate advice around essential travel”.The statement confirmed – for the first time – that Cummings had left London for the north-east.But on Saturday, Downing Street insisted the police were wrong. No 10 said that “at no stage was Cummings or his family spoken to by the police about this matter”.This version is now under intense scrutiny. Under pressure to explain the differing accounts, police issued a new statement on Saturday and stood by by the original claim.Not just that, it seems the police might have been alerted to Cummings’s presence in Durham by – his father. And that it was during this conversation that police had “reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”. By Sunday morning, Shapps was disputing a subtly different point. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “For one thing the father contacted the police, not the other way round” and claiming that security was the “key thing” in the conversation.The following days, by Wakefield’s account, were a mixture of family idyll and health nightmare, as she made a “palace out of polystyrene packaging” with their son even as Cummings’s breathing got so bad that she feared he should be in hospital.But 10 days after her husband first fell ill, she said, he began to feel better – just as Boris Johnson went into hospital. That would place the improvement in his condition around Sunday 5 April, although 10 days after the 28th – the earliest point at which Cummings was said to have been symptomatic – was 7 April.That Sunday, a passerby told the , they spotted Cummings by sheer chance. The encounter was fleeting but memorable: Cummings was standing outside with his little boy, in “dark coat and thick tartan scarf”, and Abba was playing at full blast.On the same day, the  asked Downing Street about the claims. “It’ll be a ‘no comment’ on that one,” an official responded. On the Friday of the same week, after establishing further details, the  asked again. Again, the response was no comment.Wakefield did not mention that on 12 April – her birthday, according to Companies House records – they allegedly made a trip to Barnard Castle, a charming town 30 miles from the Cummings’s family property, described on the English Heritage website as having “fantastic views” and “plenty to do for families on a day out”.That detail emerged in an interview with Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher who lives in the town.Lees, who says he has a photographic memory, told the  he was “a bit gobsmacked” to see Cummings, and then was so incensed that he made a note of the family car’s numberplate and checked it online when he got home.While government officials spent weeks refusing to talk about Cummings’s whereabouts, and have since Saturday sought to dismiss the joint investigation as “fake news” and “a stream of false allegations … from campaigning newspapers”, they have not disputed Lees’s account.His account is awkward for No 10.On Saturday, Shapps – like other Conservatives who defended the prime minister’s most senior aide – repeatedly emphasised that after the Cummings family had made their journey across the country, they had “stayed put”.Not according to Lees, they hadn’t. On Sunday, Shapps appeared to change tack.He seemed to say that this trip would have come at the end of the quarantine period.No mention, however, of the fact this trip would seem to be a clear breach of the strict lockdown rules in place at the time.Would a journey to a popular day-trip destination on a loved one’s birthday, 30 miles from the lockdown location, constitute essential travel or compliance with the government’s “stay home” instruction?That Easter weekend, a new government campaign reminded people that even at a time when people might wish to spend time together, the rules still applied. “The new campaign reinforces the importance of staying at home over Easter,” it said, reiterating the importance of “only leaving your house to buy essentials, to do one form of exercise a day, to travel into work, but only where you cannot work from home, and for any medical or social care need”.The 14-day period of Cummings’s isolation would have expired on 10 April, assuming it is counted from when Wakefield appears to have first fallen ill on 27 March. . In a piece for the Spectator, the magazine she works for, Wakefield wrote: “We emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.” No clarification, however, that they had actually emerged into the capital from Durham. asked Wakefield to confirm whether the family had been in London throughout the lockdown period, but received no reply. Cummings was photographed back in Downing Street on 14 April, clutching a bag containing a carton of soup, a tangerine and a carrot.Could Cummings have then gone back to the north-east from London? Downing Street is emphatic that he did not.The denial came after another witness claimed to the  and Sunday Mirror that they had seen Cummings and Wakefield on a country walk in Houghall Woods, a beauty spot near his parents’ property in Durham.According to this account, Cummings said: “Aren’t the bluebells lovely?”While Downing Street would give no on-the-record comment before publication of the new stories on Saturday, it then issued a statement.It accused the  and the Mirror of writing “inaccurate stories … including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April. We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers.”In interviews on Sunday, Shapps said he understood the sighting in the woods was false. But there has still been no direct on-the-record denial from Cummings himself.The witness who says they saw him on that day, in that place, is sticking by their story, but had nothing more to add."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a66a31f1fd1158dba0e968faafbb1212b6f12175/450_43_2781_1669/master/2781.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=83f7356a63a22974f1cf198d6f40de4d","title":"dominic cummings press conference leaves questions unanswered","story":"Boris Johnson’s aide failed to draw a line under the affair that has caused fury across the UKDominic Cummings’ strident defence of his own behaviour was designed to draw a line under an affair that has rocked the government and caused fury across the UK. But his press conference left questions unanswered – and also caused a degree of bafflement.1 Why not try other options?Dominic Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, have family in London. But he said that they explored no other options before settling on their trip to Durham. Why not?Did Cummings consider whether there was any risk that his wife’s trip to hospital in Durham with the couple’s son could take Covid-19 on to the site? Did he consider whether the difficulty of getting an immediate taxi was sufficient reason for him to drive to the hospital when he could “barely stand up” the night before?If Cummings had concerns over whether his eyesight was good enough to drive to London, why was he confident enough to drive 30 miles to Barnard Castle, with his wife and son in the vehicle?4 How extreme was the risk?The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said that the only reason to travel with coronavirus in search of childcare was if there was an extreme risk to life. Did the family’s situation constitute such a risk?5 Why not talk to the media earlier?Cummings said that the media had been told things were wrong but “repeatedly reported them anyway”. How does he reconcile this account with Downing Street’s refusal to engage with attempts by the  and Daily Mirror to seek comment for more than six weeks? Why did Downing Street only issue comments after the publication of key articles by the two newspapers?6 When was the walk in Durham?Cummings said that he took a walk in the second week of his stay in Durham “after I started to recover”. That would suggest he still had some symptoms. The Public Health England guidance on outdoor exercise changed that week and by 9 April all outdoor exercise was prohibited for those with symptoms. So when exactly did the walk take place?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b105280538547fb698bd6d825122046602e5441/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd1f36e0d29de64041672f5ae555895","title":"dominic cummings refuses to resign or apologise for lockdown breach","story":"Press conference raises more questions but Boris Johnson gives full backing to adviserThe crisis that has engulfed the government over Dominic Cummings’ conduct continued to rage unabated after an unprecedented press conference in which the prime minister’s chief aide repeatedly refused to resign or apologise for breaking lockdown rules.After an outpouring of public anger rattled No 10, he attempted to explain why he drove 264 miles from London to his parents’ estate in Durham despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus.No 10 had hoped the move would draw a line under fury about Cummings’ behaviour after at least 20 Tory MPs called for him to quit and senior scientists accused him of undermining public health advice.But his appearance in the Rose Garden of No 10 raised yet more questions after Cummings admitted he had suspected both he and his wife had coronavirus when they made the decision to travel across the country with their son.During the lengthy press conference, Cummings claimed he drove to Durham because he needed possible back-up childcare from his teenage niece. He insisted he and his wife and child stayed in a separate building and communicated with his parents by shouting from a distance.He also admitted they made a separate trip after his family’s 14-day period of isolation to Barnard Castle, a beauty spot 30 miles away from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London.He acknowledged they got out of the car and sat for 15 minutes by a river at a time when the lockdown rules banned nonessential trips, with exceptions for shopping, exercise and picking up medication.Cummings did, however, deny going back to Durham any time after his return to London on 14 April, saying witnesses who claimed they saw him in a bluebell wood on 19 April were mistaken. He said he had walked in woodland during his isolation period but only on his father’s property. Both the trip from London and to Barnard Castle would appear to be breaches of the government’s lockdown rules.Refusing to apologise and saying he had not offered to quit his post, Cummings said: “I don’t regret what I did … reasonable people might disagree.”Following the press conference, Johnson once again gave his full backing to his senior adviser, who was a key architect of Brexit and of Johnson’s election victory last year.The prime minister took a tone of contrition at some points, saying he did “of course regret the confusion the anger and the pain that people feel … as a country that has been going through tremendous difficulties and sufferings”.However, he also claimed that Cummings had fully explained himself and done nothing wrong, insisting: “I don’t think anyone in No 10 has done anything to undermine our messaging.” He insisted it was “very, very plausible” for Cummings to have gone to Barnard Castle because of problems with his eyesight.Johnson added: “I’m finding that I have to wear spectacles for the first time in years, because, I think, of the likely effects of this thing.”Numerous Tory MPs and cabinet ministers tweeted their backing for Cummings after the appearance but others remained unhappy with the explanation and feared that their constituents’ anger would not be assuaged.In other developments:Cummings’ movements during the end of March and early April in breach of the lockdown were first disclosed in a joint investigation by the  and Mirror.In his press conference, Cummings made clear that he had “not considered” resigning but acknowledged he could have acted differently by telling the prime minister he intended to travel to Durham before doing so.Insisting he had acted within the spirit and letter of the rules, he said: “The rules make clear that when dealing with small children, that can be exceptional circumstances and I think that was exceptional circumstances.”Asked why he was not resigning, he said: “There is understandable anger but a lot of that anger is based on reports in the media that have not been true. It’s extremely regrettable that the media were told some of these things were wrong and reported them anyway.”No 10 was repeatedly asked for a response hours in advance of the  and Mirror’s original stories and declined to comment.Cummings revealed that his son needed to go to hospital while they were in Durham. The child was taken to hospital by ambulance along with his wife, who stayed overnight. Cummings left isolation the next day to pick up his wife and child from the hospital. His son later tested negative for coronavirus.Cummings said he had no physical contact with his parents but they had “shouted conversations at a distance”. He said the trip to Durham was not mentioned in articles for the Spectator written by him and his wife about their lockdown experience because he was worried about his security.In another remarkable admission, he said he had initially gone home from work fearing that his wife had contracted coronavirus, but then headed back into No 10 later that day to continue working, instead of isolating at home for 14 days.Later that evening he made the decision to travel to Durham to seek backup childcare, fearing that they would both become ill. In the end they did not have contact with other relatives, as his wife, Mary Wakefield, was well enough to care for their son.Cummings said he had not told the prime minister where he was going as Johnson had “a million things on his plate”, but he acknowledged this could have been a mistake.Earlier on Monday, more than 20 Conservative MPs called for Cummings to resign for breaking the lockdown, including the former ministers Tim Loughton and Steve Baker.But other Tory MPs appeared to be engaging in an effort by the party’s whips to dampen down public anger by issuing nearly identical cut-and-paste messages asking constituents to “rest assured” they were passing on concerns about Cummings to the “relevant colleagues”.Opposition leaders are to meet on Tuesday morning to discuss the next steps in holding Johnson and Cummings to account.Labour said the senior No 10 aide’s statement was not good enough. A party spokesman said: “The British people were looking for at least an apology from Dominic Cummings for breaking the lockdown. They got none.“The message from this government is clear: it’s one rule for Boris Johnson’s closest adviser, another for everybody else.”The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party went further, calling for Cummings to be sacked.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said: “What should have been a resignation statement turned out to be a botched PR exercise that changes nothing. It is now beyond doubt Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d94fd6382a297dea941888701010e4563093884f/0_111_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=951e0a76abf28a707d1f95ac7b4e9050","title":"regrets st dom had a few but then again too few to mention","story":"Dominic Cummings used his press conference to flick a V and remind us rules apply differently to himClassic Dom: Downing Street’s very own Prince Andrew. Show how much respect you have for the public and the media by turning up 30 minutes late for your own gig. There again, start as you mean to go on. Because Dominic Cummings’ press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden was all about his own exceptionalism. How the rules applied differently to him than to the little people.On Sunday we had Boris Johnson, the understudy prime minister, try and fail to convince the country that there had been nothing untoward about Cummings’ trip to Durham. A midnight flit that had been so normal that Downing Street had spent the best part of six weeks trying to cover it up.Now we were to get the full story – or what approximated to it – from the person who is really running the country. And what we were treated to was an hour-long confused ramble that was disguised as the martyrdom of St Dom. A man who had only ever acted in the best interests of his family and the country. A man more sinned against than sinning.“Hi there,” he said, when he eventually turned up after a half-hour row with his wife over whether he really needed to change out of his hoodie and put on a shirt. “Sorry I’m late.”He wasn’t of course. Dom is never sorry about anything, but that was the closest we were going to get to any form of apology for having driven 260 miles to Durham to self-isolate on his parents’ estate, when the rest of the country were obeying the letter of the law, that he had helped write, by staying at home.Much of what Dom had to say made little sense. His wife had initially been ill, but he had broken with his own health guidelines by going into work the following day. He had then decided to exploit a loophole involving young children that had never been intended to apply to families in his position and drive to Durham.And no, he hadn’t bothered to get any medical advice or tell Boris what he was planning on doing. Because he was the Special One – the real prime minister – so there was no need. Indeed he might only have told Boris where he was a week later and by then they were both so ill that they conveniently forgot about the conversation until the  and the Mirror rudely reminded them.That was just the start though. His car had had a full tank of petrol – nice touch – and his son who couldn’t last a 30-minute drive to Barnard Castle without stopping for a pee had proved iron-bladdered for the entire six-hour journey north. Once in Durham, both Dom and his wife Mary had been ill with coronavirus. They had only broken lockdown once by nipping out to the local hospital because their son was unwell, and had self-isolated for the full 14 days.Then on the 15th day, St Dom had risen again. And although, he was still feeling shit he felt ready to go back to London to start running the country again. There was just one small problem. His vision was playing up. So the obvious way to see if he was safe to drive was to pack his family into the car and take a 30-mile journey to Barnard Castle.Not sure if that’s quite in the DVLA guidelines. There they had stopped and sat by the river for a bit – their entire conversation had been focused on the state of his eyesight – before heading off back to Durham for a walk in his private bluebell wood.All this was said in a state of barely repressed anger. This statement was costing Dom dear. Classic Dom never explains and never apologises. And even though not a word of apology escaped his lips, you could sense that this whole exercise felt uncomfortably close to one. Just having to appear in front of journalists for whom he felt nothing but contempt and pretend to be Mr Polite Nice Guy was a humiliation he couldn’t bear.Once the questions started, the mask began to crack. He was just doing what anyone else would have done in the same exceptional circumstances. Except they hadn’t been doing that. People in far more testing situations without the comfort of a second home 260 miles away had obeyed the guidelines. Because they were mugs. The proles who weren’t able to think for themselves. If he had a fault, it was that he was just too loving and law-abiding a father. Regrets, he had a few. But then again, too few to mention.Time and again he was asked to apologise and every time he refused. Anything but that. Everything was totally above board, which is why he and his wife had both written stories in the Spectator that they knew to be misleading. Perhaps he and Mary had both been so delirious, it had slipped their minds to point out they hadn’t been in London.Then he went full-on Trump. Everything that had been written about him was completely Fake News. Apart from everything in the  and the Mirror, which he had as good as corroborated.Had he thought of offering his resignation? A dismissive shrug. Who was he going to offer it to? Himself? There was no point in offering it to Boris because why would you ask your understudy? Just remember who worked for whom here.It ended in a standoff. If Dom had imagined this press conference would clear the air, then he had misjudged the mood of the nation just as he had by pleading for his own exceptionalism.There was also a deep irony that a man whose entire political reputation had been founded on the simplicity of his messaging was now pleading for his career on the basis that life was complicated. He even concluded by saying there was no point in answering some questions because the answers could be more confusing. So the journos could get lost.There was to be no redemption for Laughing Boy. His presser may have satisfied a few of the Boris faithful, but the majority of the country could only see a man who had chosen to break the rules and had – worse still – put the nation’s health at risk by effectively telling everyone they could interpret the rules however they wanted.Not that Dom would have cared that much. What would have hurt the most was that he had been seen for who he really was. A man who can turn any hint of regret into a giant “fuck you”.• This article was amended on 25 May 2020.

This has led to a question that has kept scientists on the hop.“If predators cannot see straight though the frogs, why do glass frogs have transparent skin at all, and not the opaque camouflaged patterns of other tree frog species?” said Dr James Barnett, a postdoctoral researcher at McMaster University, Canada, who co-authored the study.Barnett and colleagues say they have cracked the conundrum. “The frog is always green to generally match leaves, but leaves will differ in their brightness,” said Barnett. The team say that while the colour of the frog’s body changes little against dark or light foliage, the legs are more translucent and hence shift in brightness, helping the amphibians to blend in.“By having translucent legs and resting with the legs surrounding the body, the frog’s edge is transformed into a softer, less contrasting gradient from the leaf to the legs, and again from the legs to the body,” said Barnett, noting that this makes the frog’s outline less recognisable to predators.Writing in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Barnett and colleagues report how they carried out three experiments.In the first, they photographed 55 glass frogs both on leaves and on a white background and then used computer models to compare the colour of the frog in each scenario. “We found that the colour of the frogs’ bodies did not change much between backgrounds, but the legs did change significantly,” said Barnett, adding that the change was down to a shift in brightness, not hue.The results were the same when they modelled how different species may see these frogs, including a snake, a bird and a human. “The camouflaging effect is interpreted in a similar manner between humans and the frogs’ natural predators,” said Barnett.The team then produced computer-generated images of glass frogs with different patterns of translucency against leafy backgrounds. Twenty people were each presented with 125 such images and asked to point out the frog as quickly as possible. The team found participants were quicker to spot the frog when it was fully opaque compared with frogs with a natural pattern of translucency.Finally, the team made 180 translucent and 180 opaque frogs out of gelatine and put them in vegetation in Ecuador, monitoring over the course of 72 hours whether the frogs were attacked by birds. Overall, 53 opaque and 24 translucent frogs were eaten during the experiment.“Our study shows that being translucent does help glass frogs camouflage themselves from predators, but not necessarily in the way expected by comparison to fully transparent species,” said Barnett.Prof Devi Stuart-Fox, an expert on animalcolour and behaviour at the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the research, said: “This is a fascinating study because it shows yet another form of camouflage in animal – the sheer ersity of camouflage strategies in nature is truly remarkable.”Stuart-Fox said all three of the experiments had limitations, but taken together the evidence was compelling that the frogs’ translucency is a form of camouflage.“Interestingly, the legs are more translucent than the body, making the edges of the body harder to distinguish,” she said. “Predators form a search image for the shape of their prey, so masking the body’s outline is a very effective strategy to enhance camouflage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0748119492880663b2787ec8c35aa95af20337/0_0_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccc933f3d8faabd789a99f0071c9688","title":"young people tell us how rising unemployment rates are affecting you","story":"As unemployment rates skyrocket in the UK, we’d like to hear from those under 25 who have lost jobs, or are struggling to get work, due to coronavirusYoung people, who often have less experience in employment and applications, are likely to be one of the most affected groups.We’d like to hear from those under 25 who have been made unemployed, or are struggling to get a job, due to coronavirus.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Before the lockdown,  Alexander Turner spoke to and photographed the coaches and mentors behind the project – and the young people whose lives have been transformedFounded by Martin Bisp and Jamie Sanigar in 2006, Empire Fighting Chance (EFC) has transformed the Empire Boxing gym – a respected Bristol institution since the 1960s – into a vital mental health service operating in the centre of the city. With world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury frequently advocating the value of boxing and fitness towards his own mental health, the connection with boxing and emotional health has never been stronger.EFC predominantly works with people aged eight to 25 who experience significant challenges in their lives, including those excluded from school and involved in antisocial behaviour – almost always as a result of mental health issues. With a unique programme of support, EFC provides an invaluable resource to more than 4,000 people each year in one of the UK’s most deprived areas. It offers young people who would probably not access traditional forms of therapy a variety of bespoke services designed to support complicated home lives, blighted by poverty, deprivation and inadequate housing.“We are a charity that uses boxing, non-contact boxing and boxing training as a hook, to leverage the street credibility of the sport to knock down some of the barriers to entry for some of society’s most difficult to reach young people,” says EFC. Alongside that, it offers intensive personal development, psychological support, therapy, and advice on careers and education.“Young people arrive at our doors with a range of behavioural and emotional issues, including anger, anxiety, depression and low self-esteem,” says Bisp. “Their distress is often expressed in ways that can lead them into trouble rather than care and support.” Young people are referred to EFC by schools, charities, pupil referral units and even the police.Bisp says: “I’ve not yet met a 10-, 12-, or 13-year-old whose real life ambition is to be selling drugs or who wants to get involved in some of the situations they have been involved in. We have not yet met young people who have any desire to be mentally unwell. What happens is that their behaviour can manifest itself in certain ways. What we’ve found is that if you look at the symptom of anger or criminal behaviour, there are always underlying core problems. It may be chaotic home lives, it may be substance abuse by the parents, it could be domestic abuse, it could be sexual abuse. There is a whole series of factors that can lead into a behaviour that becomes symptomatic, which then gets a young person labelled.” Through its unique package of non-contact boxing and intensive personal support, EFC seeks to challenge and inspire vulnerable young people to “realise their unique potential” and participate in sport, gaining support in ways that feel natural.Marvin Rees, the first directly elected black mayor of a UK city, trained at the gym as a young man. “I was a very lost teenager, a mixed-race kid in the middle of a racially fractured Bristol in the 1980s,” he says. “Poor family, living in the inner city about 200 metres from this club. I had a reasonable brain but I was immobilised by a fear of failure and low self-esteem. Through boxing, I got a real sense of confidence. And I was also around coaches who cared.”Many of the young people EFC works with may have fallen through the gaps in mental health services or be waiting to receive support. “The young people we are dealing with come from chaotic home lives, maybe lack of parental support, lack of parents in total, they have mental health issues,” says Sanigar. “They want to access mental health services but the waiting list with CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) can be six months. The hoops that a young person has to go through – visiting the GP, getting a referral to CAMHS, making that appointment, filling out the forms … That is challenging enough if you’ve got two parents in a middle-class family. But when you’ve probably not got the support, the barriers to entry for that service are too challenging and too long-winded, too time-consuming and too late in the day. Within that period of time, anything could have happened.”Visiting the gym in 2019, Prince Harry said: “The thought of sitting down in a chair, one to one, with a therapist, can be a real deterrent. However, this is the sort of place where you don’t even realise you are being cured, but you are.”“A lot of these kids have gone through so much, it might be physical or sexual abuse, it could be anything – and they are angry,” Bisp says. “Rather than try and tell people they shouldn’t feel angry, actually what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal. Anger is a manifestation of issues, and they are issues they have a right to be angry about. So, what we’re teaching them is how to react and how to deal with those situations in a way that’s constructive.”The former IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby is a mentor at the club. “I try and get into them that I’ve worked my way up,” he says. “It’s not just sports that that works in, it’s general life. If you work hard you can achieve your goals and your dreams.” The influence of somebody such as Selby on marginalised young people – many of whom will have grown up watching and hearing of his achievements – can be dramatic. “They know I am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me,” he says. “At school they are being told what to do by some posh guy and they are not really interested.”For many of the young people, a supportive, nurturing relationship with an adult can be a new experience. Sarah, foster mother of April, 16, describes how April’s relationship with her coach Courtney “has grown to the point where Courtney is a trusted adult. That has been a rare thing for her in her life, in her experience. It’s really important.”This type of relationship at EFC is built and maintained over a 20-week programme that combines non-contact boxing with mentoring and psychological education. The coaches believe that boxing, being largely inidual and broken into three-minute rounds, allows a unique opportunity for therapy and mentoring.“The way that boxing is broken down into rounds means you’ve got opportunities to build relationships and to talk while they are doing the activity,” says Sanigar. “They can be skipping and you can be having a conversation. They can stop for a minute, you can have a conversation, you can’t do that in football. You have your own inidual goal set by a coach, and your goal might be to get five skips. We build small mini-goals for young people to achieve.”Ellie, 15, was referred to EFC by her therapist. “I had a really bad home growing up,” she says. “I never had space where I could just go to relax. It was always tension, tension, tension. I struggle with really bad anger issues. They have calmed down a lot, so much, since being here. Even after the first session you could see the difference. I’d keep everything in and wouldn’t let anything out. They really taught me how to open up about how I’m feeling. It’s definitely made a difference in every aspect of my life.”Nina, who has PTSD, depression and social anxiety says Empire has made her “less anxious about being in groups, and being with new people”. She adds: “I just feel comfortable being able to come back even if I don’t have to do the sessions. I can speak to someone, it doesn’t necessarily even have to be about what’s going on, it can just be about anything which helps and it’s a nice distraction from everything else.”Dontae, 17, was referred to the gym after being excluded from school a number of times. He is now at college studying health and fitness and says: “I started coming in more and more regularly. I started loving it and my confidence grew more and more knowing how I feel, and telling them how I feel, and them listening to how I feel. It’s helped me to calm down. They are basically like mentors to me. My mental health has got better. My mental health was just about anger, anger, anger. Now it isn’t. I feel better, I feel more normal. I feel more awareness, mentally stronger, knowing what decisions can benefit me.”One issue that EFC regularly identifies in young people is low self-esteem and sense of self-worth. “The level of extremity has drastically changed over recent years”, says Sanigar. “This is inner city, an area of deprivation that is going through a bit of a funny change at the moment. A three-bed house will cost you over £300,000. If you are growing up in this area with nothing – no role models, no mentors – it’s practically impossible now for you to get on the property ladder. Youth services have been closed. There is nothing for them and they are becoming more isolated, sitting in their bedrooms. They are living a fantasy life on their phones, where it’s Instagram, Snapchat – all these wonderful lives out there. They are suddenly looking at their lives and it is destroying their self-esteem.”One of the employment schemes EFC runs is with local coffee roasters Extract Coffee, who offer a barista training programme. Steven, 20, found employment after completing the course: “I wouldn’t have got the job at Boston Tea Party without Empire giving me that push. When I started coming to Empire I wasn’t in a great place, but now everything has changed. After doing boxing sessions day by day, my mood generally got a lot better. I feel happier, I don’t have those days when I don’t feel like doing anything because I don’t have the self-esteem or the energy. I’m actively looking to do stuff. Compared to where I first started that’s quite a big leap.”EFC has also trained qualified therapists in non-contact boxing skills in order to provide support to young people with some of the most severe mental health issues.“The demographic we have here is very varied,” says therapist Jane Ivall. “Often they will be some of the hardest-to-reach young people. The fact they are engaging and connecting here is a good starting point for them engaging and connecting with us. Here, there is a whole range of people with a whole range of issues, and we just come alongside them using the medium of boxing to enable them to access mental health support. The boxing breaks down the barriers to traditional therapy. It enables people to open up and access things they traditionally may not feel comfortable to access. Talking about a trauma is complex. Working physically enables you to shift trauma, to explore things and to build a rapport and trust with a therapist quicker.”According to Rees, “the benefits to the wider city are pretty straightforward: a healthier population. Young people who are less likely to become mentally unwell, who have more structure in their lives and who are better able to develop their own talents, abilities and ambitions in life. They are also less likely to become service users, or engage in activities that take away the quality of life from other people.”“We’re not careers specialists, we’re not education specialists, we’re not mental health specialists,” says Bisp. “We’ve had to just do our best and what we think is right, and thankfully the results over the last 10 years have proven that what we do does work”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85efe843737a1365ea6f67041c5244defe841840/61_0_3378_2029/master/3378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1214781a3d78f77c8fc8e7bcf7aa7a4a","title":"dina asher smith commonwealth games gold 2022 kelly sotherton","story":"The pile-up of championships in 2022 could rob the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham of some of its biggest stars and will make it impossible for Dina Asher-Smith to attempt a unique treble, Kelly Sotherton has warned.Sotherton, three-times an Olympic medallist and the new track and field leader for Team England, is still hopeful she can persuade Asher-Smith to take part in Birmingham during a summer when the world championships, Commonwealth Games and European championships all take place during a five-week window between 15 July and 21 August.But Sotherton admitted the prospects of Asher-Smith attempting the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay in Birmingham and Katarina Johnson-Thompson doing another heptathlon immediately after competing at the world championships in Oregon are slim because of fatigue.“The fixture congestion is not ideal,” Sotherton said. “Hopefully, ideally, we would have loved to see Dina Asher-Smith come to Birmingham, do the treble again. That is not going to happen realistically. She is not going to go to the worlds then come to Birmingham and maybe even go to the Europeans in Munich. She will maybe be selective.“My job is to speak to everybody and say: ‘OK, is the Commonwealth Games in your plans? If not, why isn’t it? It is a home Games. It should be a priority because your profile will be massive going into it, everyone will want to know who you are and you will gain new fans. Commercially it will be better for you.’ But I understand that financially for the better athletes the worlds will be where it is at because there is potential for more money.”The former heptathlete added: “KJT is not coming to the Commonwealth Games to do a heptathlon but she might come and do a long jump or high jump. In the same way maybe Dina might come to Birmingham to do the relay. I would love all of the stars to be part of the Games so all the fans can see them. It is finding that balance.”Sotherton is optimistic she can help England surpass the 29 athletics medals won when the Games were staged in Manchester in 2002. “I truly believe we can get that or can exceed that,” she said. “I believe we can be the most successful team at a home Games.

The openings are dependent on the government classifying high-street betting shops as supplying a “non-essential” product rather than as part of the hospitality industry, which is not expected to reopen until July.Betting shops had previously been expected to reopen no earlier than 4 July, at the start of the third phase of the government’s steady unwinding of the lockdown. However, following an announcement by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, on Monday evening that all “non-essential” shops can reopen from 15 June, it now seems that the retail betting industry may be back in business just 24 hours before one of the biggest meetings of the year.Betting shops are on a government list of outlets circulated to retailers on Monday evening that are able to open from 15 June. It also includes fashion shops, antique stores, photography studios, gift shops and dress fitters.“We are well prepared to open some of our shops in June,” a spokesperson for GVC said, “and will be following the Covid-19 secure guidance.”The suspension of racing since mid-March has cost racing around £8m per month in income from the Betting Levy, which returns money to the industry from the profits of off-course bookmakers, both on the high street and online. The big betting chains, meanwhile, also contribute many millions of pounds to racecourses in media rights payments for showing live action in their shops.Ladbrokes and Coral operate around 4,000 betting shops while William Hill, which has about 2,300, has already said it plans a “staged” reopening of outlets when government lockdown restrictions allow it. The early reopening of betting shops on the eve of the Royal meeting would be a big boost to racing, which depends on daily meetings to keep money flowing throughout the industry but has not seen horses competing since mid-March.While some of that total would have been expected to shift online if betting shops were not open, the demand for cash betting remains strong and the extra income for the sport from Royal Ascot if some high-street shops open could be at least £1m in Levy income alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/326bd8e83caf4dbe4c57278b547bc593cd326e98/0_215_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=177317d507d3a214cea48ccec269d3de","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated dailyThe National has risen to the occasion by unveiling a mighty lineup of some of its greatest NT Live hits, to be streamed online on Thursdays at 7pm and then available for seven days.

The sequel, This Is Not My Hat, also staged on top of a wooden dresser and told with music by Jim Whitcher, is a kind of Grand Theft Aqua in which a tiddler has stolen a handsome green bowler from a much bigger fish who reclaims it while enjoying a snack.

But anyone hoping that X Æ A-12 might be replaced by something a little more conventional is going to be disappointed.In an Instagram post on Sunday, Grimes confirmed that the baby formerly known as X Æ A-12 would now be known as X Æ A-Xii.Grimes gave no explanation for the change to using roman numerals, but later responded to a post asking if the alteration was made to comply with a California law that holds only the 26 letters of the alphabet can be used for child names.“Roman numerals. Looks better tbh,” she wrote.The couple appeared to have been at odds over how to interpret X Æ A-12 from the outset. The musician, whose real name is Claire Elise Boucher, previously explained that Æ was her “elven spelling” of AI (for artificial intelligence) and “X” stood for “the unknown variable”.“It’s just X, like the letter X. Then AI. Like how you said the letter A then I,” wrote Grimes on Thursday in response to a query on Instagram.But Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, told the podcast host Joe Rogan a different story: “I mean it’s just X, the letter X. And then the Æ is, like, pronounced ‘Ash’… and then A-12. A-12 is my contribution.”Musk already had five children – Griffin and Xavier and triplets Damian, Saxon and Kai – as well as a son, Nevada, who died as an infant. He credited his partner for the creative leap.“First of all, my partner is the one that, actually, mostly, came up with the name,” he said. “Yeah, she’s great at names.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

The absence of cars and planes swept away the Athenian smog and the spring skies shone with an uncanny clarity, throwing the familiar outline of the monument into sharp relief. The Parthenon seemed to vibrate with the promise of transcendence – a symbol of humanity’s ability to outlast, to overcome, to survive. But one thing was missing: the tiny tourists, clinging to the edges of the rock like a trail of black ants, were gone. There was nobody up there communing with the spirit of Athena, except perhaps for a few stray cats snoozing in the shade of those giant columns.So when archaeological sites opened up again – along with shopping centres, beauty parlours and high schools – in Greece on 18 May, I wanted to be the first up on that hill. But my plan was foiled by an unseasonal heatwave that kept Athenians confined indoors there was no question of scrambling up the Acropolis hill in 37C. On Thursday, the heat finally broke. In the silvery evening light, my seven-year-old son and I wandered past the restless shoppers parading up and down Ermou Street, the equivalent of Oxford Street. The crowds dissipated in the old town of Plaka, the souvenir shops still shuttered, the touts who normally prowl hungrily outside the tavernas gone. Usually, there’s a long queue of people waiting to enter the Acropolis, even at the quieter entrance on the north slope, by the ancient theatre of Dionysus. For us, there was nobody.“The marble had space to breathe, the temple had a chance to rest,” the gloved ticket seller smiled behind her plexiglass shield, when I told her how excited I was about our private audience with one of the wonders of the world. “Imagine, there are usually 10-12,000 people a day clambering over these stones. Today, there might be 10 of you up there.”A couple of masked security guards waved us up the slopes to the Propylaea, the monumental portico that marks the entrance to the sacred precinct. Yellow stickers warning visitors to “keep safe distance” had been stuck on intermittent steps, fashioned from massive slabs of marble. “Were people really huge in ancient Greece?” my son wondered, marvelling at the size of the stairs. Everything seemed amplified without the chattering, snap-happy crowds. The Parthenon looked even more monumental than usual. A gusty wind drove moody clouds across the mountains that encircle the city. Shards of sunlight pierced the clouds, like searchlights scanning the cascading blocks of concrete that surround the site, whose vanilla and nicotine palette matched the fragmentary columns scattered about in poetic arrangements.And there, on the horizon, was the sea, punctuated by stationary ships and islands, still off limits to travellers.Four teenage girls were taking selfies on a ledge, the Greek flag fluttering behind them. Three students were sitting on a marble bench, staring variously into their phones and into the distance. A man was fielding phone calls, while his two young daughters scampered around the ruins. There were plenty of affectionate cats, to my son’s delight. But I didn’t expect the gulp of swallows, slaloming in and out of the Parthenon’s columns in a joyous, sonorous game of tag.I took a couple of photos that didn’t do justice to the view or the monument or the moment. And then, auspiciously, my phone died. I didn’t have to filter this once-in-a-lifetime experience through a screen. I felt suddenly liberated, elated – like the tanned, insouciant tourists in photographer Tod Papageorge’s On the Acropolis, a recently published series of black-and-white photographs shot in the early 1980s. Reclining, embracing or unselfconsciously draped on the ruins like a modern-day frieze, these luminous mortals represent a time when touching the Parthenon and one another was perfectly natural."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/792d8d847df043cf3c1c027102b11de1a734fd30/1445_1163_3448_2069/master/3448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7f74faaf90239ead9e28994aae5a38d","title":"life after lockdown in new zealand a night out in wanaka","story":"After a strict seven weeks of confinement, the atmosphere in the resort town’s reopened bars varies from restrained to raucousWanaka lakefront is a tourism wonderland a buzzy, bar-filled strip with a 180-degree view of the Southern Alps. At the height of the season, the town is defined by its epic parties. Alongside a love of snow and action sports, there is an equal love of decadence locally brewed beer, top-shelf pinot noir and late, luscious nights.In 2014, I was working as a librarian in town and the Trout bar became my local. Through then-permitted social mingling, I appeared in a country music video filmed at the bar, met a boyfriend there, and buddied up with a locum doctor who became a close friend.Late last week, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, permitted bars and clubs to open after a strict seven-week lockdown. Rigorous social-distancing measures have been stipulated, including keeping tables two metres apart and no “mingling” between the tables. The “bar” of the bar is off-limits (“high-risk”, health officials say) and there is table service only.For Trout owners Moana and Brent MacKenzie, former dairy farmers from Southland, the lockdown couldn’t have come at a worse time: they had only taken over seven weeks before. The couple accessed the wage-subsidy scheme for their employees, and say strong local support should mean they can stay afloat – but adjusting to the more-restrained atmosphere and the strict health guidelines has been a challenge.“My wife, Moana, cuddles everyone and she’s had to rein that in, which she’s found very difficult,” says Brent.On Saturday night, Moana buzzes around the bar, leaning into customers with a big smile, trying to put everyone at ease as some struggle with nerves the requirement to sign in, use hand sanitiser, and remain at their tables. People keep wandering up to the bar for a chat or another pint – forgetting – and are gently ushered back to their tables.“That’s probably the hardest thing for me because I’m a warm person,” says Moana. “I get banished to stand behind the bar a bit because my natural urge is to touch. I miss that interaction with our locals, especially when they’re supporting us.”Trout does a good trade on Saturday night, but the atmosphere – like many bars and restaurants in town – is a little stiff. There’s no raucous laughter and conversations are subdued, and somewhat earnest.“It’s definitely a different vibe,” says Kay Scott, 47, who’s out for a birthday drink with her husband, Stu, and on their first social adventure beyond their own home in months.“It’s a lot quieter than it would be, usually the rugby would be on, which gives things a kick along. I miss that. Yeah, it just feels like everyone’s being kind of cautious,” says Kay.Since opening, Wanaka police have done a number of random patrols of the bar, including on Trout’s opening night.“We had the police walk in, there were eight wives in the corner, and eight husbands on the opposite side of the room,” says Moana, chuckling.“The police panicked, thinking they were singles and would start mingling. I said to the police, ‘They’re husbands and wives, look what you’ve done, you’re creating chaos in homes around Wanaka.’”Two hundred metres down the lakefront and up a flight of stairs is the dark and moody La La Land, a cocktail bar that is empty at 9pm. My partner and I order drinks and – being introverted – don’t mind having the DJ to ourselves. Within the hour though, the place is heaving, and social-distancing rules are open-slather ignored as drunk (or drugged) patrons loll over the bar, sidle up to strangers and unleash energy that feels barbed and slightly dangerous.A policeman, older, does a cursory patrol that takes less than a minute. As soon as he leaves, the party kicks off again, and the atmosphere is charged with late-night promise. The two staff, employed to serve 40, are overwhelmed.By midnight, any pretension of social-distancing is yesterday’s news at Rove in Post Office Lane. New couples kiss by outdoor braziers, tourists are invited to join large tables of locals, and staff look – mostly – pissed off about table service.After so many weeks at home, reading our books and making homemade soups from garden vegetables, it’s a relief to see faces that are not each other, and not familiar in any way. While we stick together, soberly at our table, the mob of glossy strangers and the fizz of where the night could lead swirl around us like an elixir of youth, hunger and a total disregard for the rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e886f567e6d300d036229eae5514ba79e705f38/0_286_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n\u0026s=6bcac542f9c6b13e221fb4228ae19926","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

A key question is whether antibodies produced by the body following an infection with the coronavirus provide some level of immunity, and if so, for how long.But we do have some clues. “We know from ‘normal’ coronavirus studies done in the past you can infect people after about a year following an initial infection,” said Dr Ben Killingley, consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at University College London hospital.Dr Joshua Schiffer, an expert in infectious diseases at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the US, added that any signs of reinfection would require detailed scrutiny.“It is also important to recognise that documentation of one or a handful of reinfections does not prove that this is a common, epidemiologically important event.” This initially caused concerns, as experts feared the results might suggest patients had been reinfected. However, the World Health Organization has since said the results were actually false positives, a result of the test picking up particles of the virus within dead lung cells – but this is not active virus. That’s because the PCR (or “have-you-got-it”) test is based on detecting genetic material from the virus – on its own it does not reveal whether that virus is active, and infectious, or not.Some people with Covid-19 experience complications following an initial infection.“In some persons they begin to feel well again and signs and symptoms including fever decrease, but some then go on to develop respiratory distress and must be provided oxygen in hospital,” said David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It appears to be a delayed immune response that is more serious in some persons and that reacts to remaining virus in various organs.”Even some people who have had a mild experience of Covid-19 have reported experiencing symptoms for several weeks or even months, although experts say only time and testing will tell what the long-term implications are and how common this is.Killingley said it was unclear what was behind such ongoing symptoms, but there are a range of possibilities – including inflammation caused by the virus – although the mechanisms and risks are, as yet, unclear. Immunology professor Daniel Altmann, of Imperial College London, said such cases are important to study.Schiffer agreed such cases are cause for concern. “In the case of Sars CoV-2, my colleagues and I are particularly worried about the possibility of prolonged periods of lung inflammation andor scarring,” he said.A recent study of 60 coronavirus patients in China showed 10 patients tested positive for Covid-19 after discharge from hospital. However, once again, experts say this could be down to the test picking up genetic material from inactive virus, with other studies, including work in South Korea, suggesting those who test positive with Covid-19 after recovering from the disease are not infectious.“It’s not uncommon to find virus in the nose or throat for up to four weeks after initial infection, but tests to establish whether this is live infectious virus – as opposed to just genetic material detection – are not normally positive for much longer than a week,” said Killingley, adding: “I haven’t come across relapse cases whereby the initial infection acquired weeks ago reignites itself into an infectious case.”Schiffer had doubts: “In my view, the presence of Sars CoV-2 RNA many weeks after initial infection may represent ongoing viral replication in cells, which also implies the persistence of small amounts of “active” virus,” he said. “However, quantities are tiny and may represent the dying embers of infection in the body.”Altmann said that, asymptomatic cases aside, infectiousness correlates strongly with acute symptoms, which typically last for up to 12 days, with a tailout to 28 days. “My sense is that in the people who are feeling unwell long after this, it may not be virus, but some kind of immune or inflammatory perturbation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7796a34fb577737ae1baf1faa2721c2cea2f6706/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50f0f0ae6f9bdd5ee33ab9ff73b17f95","title":"burundi ruling party candidate wins election since 1993","story":"A ruling party candidate, handpicked by the outgoing president, has won Burundi’s first competitive election since a decade-long civil war began in 1993, electoral officials have announced.There have been claims of rigging and repression during the campaign.The incumbent Pierre Nkurunziza was forced to step aside after 15 years in power by opponents within the country’s CNDD-FDD, and his successor was selected as someone acceptable to the country’s powerful generals.Nkurunziza will become “supreme guide” in the small and poverty-hit country, with wide if ill-defined power. The former leader will also receive a $0.5m (£410,000) gift from the nation along with a luxury villa.Rights groups say the government is pressing ahead with the vote irresponsibly, and accuse the ruling party and its youth wing of systematically crushing dissent.Between January and March, Ligue Iteka, an exiled Burundian human rights organisation, documented 67 killings, including 14 extrajudicial executions, six disappearances, 15 cases of gender-based violence, 23 cases of torture, and 204 arbitrary arrests. There was also some violence directed against ruling party members and youths – including killings – but at much lower levels.Burundian police detained more than 200 opposition electoral observers, the spokesman for the main opposition National Freedom Council said last week.The election took place amid concern that authorities are deliberately playing down the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic. The nation of 11 million people has reported 42 cases of Covid-19 and one death and officials have cited ine protection for Burundi’s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear.Nkurunziza’s spokesperson recently said that though the country may be hit by the pandemic, “Burundi … has signed a special covenant with God, whether you believe it or not”. Earlier this month, Burundi expelled the World Health Organization’s expert team working on coronavirus.Nelleke van de Walle of the research organisation International Crisis Group said last week the campaign had seen “certain elements of a real election” but was “definitely not an election where people can express their opinions freely”.Both Ndayishimiye and Rwasa were senior commanders in predominantly Hutu militias during a civil war in which about 300,000 people were killed. Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 as part of a peace deal.Ndayishimiye has promised to “fight poverty and develop the country”, claiming his party had taken 15 years to “lay the foundations” for the future and it was not the time to put “amateurs” in power.The country’s last election in 2015 led to violence that left at least 1,200 dead, displaced hundreds of thousands and resulted in a sustained crackdown on the opposition and media. Aid was cut off by donors and sanctions imposed.Last year, the government shut down the UN human rights office after repeated criticism that members of the CNDD-FDD’s youth wing and the security services were torturing, gang-raping and murdering political opponents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/210f05fb6f30fe50a7c837cd728aee00036e3a27/0_227_5367_3220/master/5367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb30f015974416a1bfb38812183b46bf","title":"covid 19 lockdowns african americans essential workers","story":"Experts warn reopening states could have dire consequences on public health, and black Americans already face greater riskDonald Trump recently shared a doctored video of his head superimposed on to actor Bill Pullman’s character in the 1996 film Independence Day’s crowd-rallying scene, likening frontline workers to warriors.But it rang hollow for Denita Jones, a Dallas-area call center worker. For many black, essential workers like her, the message is about reopening the economy, but the real meaning is more subtle.“We’re not essential, we’re expendable,” she said.African Americans in Texas are dying of Covid-19 at a rate more than one-third higher than their share of the population. Yet across the country, the protesters who became the faces of the race to reopen have been mostly white.Jones points out that when another Dallas area woman defiantly violated the state’s stay-at-home order, Republican leaders mostly applauded her. Salon owner Shelley Luther, who is white, cut Senator Ted Cruz’s hair just days after being sentenced to county jail and fined.Experts have warned lifting stay-at-home orders could have dire consequences on public health, with social advocates warning that it could result in the sacrifice of many for the benefit of few. Many critics argue that’s the point: the meaning behind the message. As it has been the case throughout much of American history, those most likely to be negatively impacted are African American.According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, even if US states reopen with social distancing rules in place, an additional 233,000 deaths could result from the outbreak.Black Americans face greater risk. Across the country African American populations are concentrated in major cities, where coronavirus cases have so far been highest.“That job paid my bills, provided for me and my child, because she can’t provide for herself,” she said. “If I don’t have any money, I don’t have a way to live. I’d be out on the streets.”“The choice of governments to circumvent science to advance this cause of reopening falls on the backs of people of color, the poor and immigrants. It is more than reckless,” said Dr Chandra Ford, a UCLA professor and the director of the Center for Racism, Social Justice and Health. “You can’t run a business when you aren’t breathing”.While the coronavirus had already disproportionately affected black Americans because of the prevalence of underlying health issues such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes, the pandemic has also exposed existing racial inequities in the US healthcare and labor system.Black people are twice as likely to lack health insurance compared with their white counterparts, and more likely to live in medically underserved areas where they face health facility closures and caps on public health plans.“We have a governmental policy of violence that is producing unnecessary deaths among poor people and people of color,” said the Rev Dr William Barber of the Poor People’s Campaign, a social advocacy group. “It is a form of policy mass murder.”For many, it’s no coincidence, then, that a shift in tone from keeping all Americans safe to reopening businesses at all costs occurred after data confirmed blacks and Latinos are primarily contracting the virus. “The lives of disproportionately black and brown workers are being sacrificed to fuel the engine of a faltering economy, by a president who disdains them,” the Atlantic’s Adam Sewer wrote.From slavery and experimental medical treatments, to redlining and predatory lending scandals, black history in the US has long entailed laboring, both voluntarily and not, for the benefit of an American society that excluded them.That history continues well into today’s global health crisis. Despite research indicating the virus made its way to the US via European tourists, testing guidelines that required recent foreign travel meant those considered eligible skewed wealthy and white.“What we know now is that Covid-19 had been circulating in our communities for much longer than we realized,” Dr Uché Blackstock said of her black and brown communities in New York City’s Brooklyn and Queens boroughs. Testing at the time was concentrated to the richer, whiter Manhattan.The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) have since advised health professionals to be on the lookout for medical bias.Dr Mary Bassett, the director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center of Health and Human Rights at Harvard, rejected selectively opening communities considered less Covid susceptible, noting that fuels biases that result in unequal treatment for black Americans during a pandemic.“The idea of racial susceptibility to diseases is longstanding in the US, but is simply inaccurate,” she said, adding the risk of exposure is defined by how people’s lives work, not where they live.Because the virus doesn’t discriminate, the former health commissioner for New York City warned without substantial improvements to testing, contact tracing and treatments, the US simply isn’t ready to reopen anywhere.Jones was only called back to work at the Dallas call center this month, after a lengthy furlough. Her colleagues have erse political views, and some stayed home, others didn’t. At work, there were no temperature checks and masks were optional.Before heading home, she has to call her two asthmatic children so they can isolate in their bedrooms while she disinfects her skin and clothes. There’s no other choice. If Jones didn’t work, she would be not be eligible for unemployment benefits.“This is not fair to me, my family or any essential worker who has to return,” she said. “It’s frightening that I have to come in to this type of environment. But it was either feed my family or not return.”Even relief isn’t equitable. A survey found black businesses were less likely to be approved for aid from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program. Experts warn that could worsen the financial wealth gap between whites and blacks.“When white America catches a cold, black America catches pneumonia,” Steven Brown of the Urban Institute told CNN Business. “It’s going to be a lot harder for people to dig out once things get stable again.”Meanwhile, Republican governors, including Greg Abbott of Texas, continue to relax restrictions even as data shows an uptick in the number of confirmed cases.“It’s disheartening to know my country thinks that I’m expendable,” Jones said. “But I have a governor shouting from high that we must reopen”.As the Trump administration escalates reopening efforts, workers have organized walkouts and strikes. The social justice organizations Black Lives Matter and Barber’s Poor People’s Campaign are leading digital movements of their own.He contends that isions have made the pandemic less personal. According to YouGov, a London-based research and analytics group, black Americans are twice as likely as white people to know someone who died from Covid-19.“Too many folk seem to see this pandemic as other people’s problem. Those people are the issue,” he said.Americans of all races overwhelmingly support stay-at-home orders. But responses are largely skewed along party lines. The ide is expected to grow as anti-lockdown protests continue.While the message of reopening states for the sake of the country is loud, Barber added that, for poor Americans, people of color and immigrants, the real meaning is deadly.“We were already a nation of power players too comfortable with people dying from poverty, ineptitude and greed,” he said. “That is a moral movement that impacts every poor person, from black folk in the Delta to white folk in Appalachia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e104247a1d843e2a4fa906059f9d20c13f0509/78_33_3323_1994/master/3323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=523cbbfddb0d40a9cfe2823491c29fb0","title":"german state causes alarm with plans to ease lockdown measures thuringia second wave coronavirus","story":"Thuringia accused of being highly irresponsible as second wave of virus seen as inevitableNegotiations in Germany over a nationwide approach to relaxing lockdown measures were said to be in disarray after the state of Thuringia announced it was going it alone.The federal government cancelled a meeting of its “corona cabinet” after Thuringia’s premier, Bodo Ramelow, announced his state would end both the obligatory wearing of face coverings and the limit on the number of people allowed to gather within the next two weeks.“The danger is not over, but the strategy must be measured,” Ramelow said.His announcement, which appeared to take the other 15 state leaders by surprise, flies in the face of the scientific advice that the federal government of Angela Merkel has been following, such as physical distancing, hygienic precautions and wearing face coverings. Leaders had also wanted to see the effect from easing other measures, including the gradual opening of schools, before taking further steps.According to German media, some of the coronavirus cabinet and state leaders accused Ramelow of taking a highly irresponsible approach, with one likening it to “stepping on a minefield”.Jens Spahn, the federal health minister, said Ramelow’s announcement was premature, adding: “We cannot allow the impression to emerge that the pandemic is already over. Right now we are seeing whole regions where day after day there are no new registered infections, and on the other hand, local and regional outbreaks where the virus is spreading quickly and which demand immediate intervention.”Ramelow said his plans were justified because Thuringia had one of the lowest coronavirus rates in Germany, 133 infections per 100,000 people compared with 353 per 100,000 in neighbouring Bavaria. He insisted if new infections in any part of Thuringia rose beyond 35 per 100,000 within a week, restrictions would be reintroduced immediately.At the weekend there was alarm over virus outbreaks in East Frisia after a reported gathering of shipyard workers in a restaurant. Eighteen people were infected and the restaurant was being investigated for possible breaches of coronavirus containment rules, authorities said.In Frankfurt the congregation of a Baptist church service was being questioned after 107 people who attended a service on 10 May were found to be infected.In Hamburg police raided a bar over the weekend that was reported to have been breaking hygiene rules.Anti-lockdown demonstrations that were expected to take place across Germany were either cancelled or low-key owing to heavy thunderstorms.On Monday, the Robert Koch Institute, the German government’s epidemiological advisory body, reported a further 289 coronavirus infections over the weekend, the smallest increase since the peak of the pandemic. There are 178,570 confirmed cases in Germany and 8,257 deaths, which rose by 10 over the weekend.While Germany has so far emerged from the health crisis with fewer deaths to confirmed cases than many other countries, there is little sense of relief, with a second wave in either the summer or autumn seen as inevitable.Lower Saxony’s premier, Stephan Weil, said: “The coronavirus has by no means disappeared, which is why we’re in favour of continuing to increase the relaxations step by step, without overdoing things.”A spokesman for the government of Bavaria, which borders Thuringia and has been among the worst-hit regions, called Ramelow’s plans “an incredibly dangerous experiment for all the people in this country”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00fdd2330dc7265bd325b61bdf4d5ef1293e7a9d/126_10_1857_1114/master/1857.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=836ed6e6b601a9fe456fb3991d64b778","title":"jacinda ardern earthquake new zealand pandemic cool calm","story":"The New Zealand prime minister has calmly steered her country in the face of a massacre, an eruption, and a pandemic.

What if leading Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan had gone on state television on 20 January and delivered news that the unusual virus detected in Wuhan was not spreading between people, instead of what he really said that night: that human-to-human transmission was certain? The infection might have been traced to animal carcasses piled in a seafood market’s lanes, and after they were destroyed – and experts issued their usual warnings that a more serious outbreak was inevitable – the coronavirus story might have ended.What would we be talking about instead? What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments.In the middle of the night in Baghdad, on 3 January, a US drone fired the most consequential shot in the Middle East in a generation, killing 10 people including Qassem Suleimani, leader of the expeditionary force of Iran’s Revolution Guards.The 62-year-old general had been a thorn in the side of the American-led occupation of Iraq, overseeing the Islamic republic’s campaign in Syria and nurturing proxies that turned Iran into a regional player. He was thought to be untouchable. Donald Trump marked his killing with a wordless tweet of a grainy American flag.The chaotic days following the killing involved a deadly crush at one of the general’s public funerals, Iran’s first ever missile strikes on US troops, the accidental shooting down of a passenger jet over Tehran – killing all 176 aboard – and an outburst of anti-regime protests in Iranian cities.The reverberations may be felt for years: nearly all the regional projects Suleimani was overseeing when he died have faltered, the Observer reported this month, and the al-Quds force is struggling to manage its network of proxies without his giant presence.The largest swarms of locusts in decades have descended on farms in parts of Africa, south Asia and the Arabian peninsula this year, posing “an extremely alarming and unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods”, according to the UN.The pests form vast, destructive clouds that can travel about 55 miles (90km) in 24 hours. A swarm about a square kilometre large can consume the same quantity of food in a day as 35,000 people. The risk of second waves is said to still be critical, including in Yemen, where food security is already dire amid the ongoing civil war.Hostility towards Indian Muslims has crept further into the Indian mainstream in the past five years since the country’s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, was elected. In February, it boiled over during a state visit by Donald Trump, culminating in the country’s worst religious violence in decades.The catalyst was widely acknowledged to be a ruling party leader, Kapil Mishra, who on 23 February issued a public ultimatum that if the police did not clear the streets of mostly Muslim protesters, his supporters would be “forced to hit the streets”.At least 50 were killed in the ensuing violence between Hindu and Muslim mobs, amid allegations that the Delhi police stood back to allow Hindus to commit violence while beating to death some of the Muslim men in their custody.The riots and killings contributed to growing unease about the kind of India that may emerge from Modi’s years in power.After nearly 19 years, more than 43,000 civilian casualties and three US presidents, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban on a Saturday afternoon in late February.It was a good deal for the Taliban: they managed to exclude elected officials in Kabul and deal with the Americans directly. On paper, US troops could be gone from the country by spring 2021. The Taliban have promised to sit down with their Afghan government counterparts and make a separate peace deal later, but there is no guarantee they will do so, and their attacks on the Afghan army and police continue.The US says the ongoing violence means their troops may stay, but it is clear, not least to the Taliban, that Washington is desperate to get out of the war.For a few days after Bernie Sanders swept the Las Vegas Democratic primary, it appeared that a self-described “democratic socialist” was going to win the nomination of a major American party. Instead, the Democratic establishment rallied behind former vice-president Joe Biden, the campaign’s standard-bearer for the liberalism of the Obama and Clinton eras.Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday and soon after clinched the nomination, but there was no victory tour, nor conciliatory rallies with his opponents. Instead, the 77-year-old appeared to vanish from view as the scale of the coronavirus emergency finally broke through to policymakers and the public. He is currently campaigning from the basement of his Delaware home.On 6 February, an Argentine weather station on Antarctica’s northern tip recorded a temperature of 18.4C (65.1F) – roughly the same as Los Angeles that day, Nasa noted. The freak temperatures were attributed to the confluence of warmer than average sea surfaces, a high pressure system over South America and a warming phenomenon known as the foehn effect.They come against a backdrop of another looming crisis: an almost 3C temperature increase on the Antarctic peninsula over the past 50 years, part of a pattern of unusual weather events associated with global heating, including Australia’s catastrophic bushfire season.Campaigners in April hailed the passage of a new law that makes the practice punishable by up to three years in prison, but were sober about its impact. The practice is entrenched in Sudanese culture and will take time to be eradicated entirely. “There is so much work to be done. This is a start, a good start,” Fatma Naib, a Unicef communication officer in Sudan, told the .A dawn raid in a Paris suburb in May snared one of the world’s most wanted men. Félicien Kabuga, a wealthy Rwandan businessman, is accused of creating and funding the notorious Interahamwe militia that carried out the 1994 killings of about 800,000 people in less than three months.His radio station, the Radio-Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, allegedly helped lay the groundwork for the genocide with its relentless dehumanisation of the Tutsi population. “You have missed some of the enemies,” it said in one notorious broadcast during the killings. “You must go back there and finish them off. The graves are not yet full.”A 2003 attempt to capture Kabuga in Nairobi ended with the mysterious death of the man who was supposed to give up his location. French police said the 84-year-old had also spent time in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.He is yet to enter a plea in a French or international court, but his lawyers said last week that he had the right to be presumed innocent.The fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 26-year-old African American, as he jogged in a coastal city in the US state of Georgia in February, initially received little national attention. The two men accused of killing him claimed they did so in self-defence. Police and prosecutors showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the case.That changed with the 5 May release of a video depicting Arbery’s last moments. The man is trailed slowly by a car as he jogs on quiet street. He reaches another vehicle and two armed men appear. A struggle ensues with one and several gunshots go off. The last scene shows Arbery dying in the street.The shocking footage led to the arrest of the three men present at the shooting, and has rekindled popular rage at the dangers black men can face in predominantly white communities, and the impunity and inaction that regularly follows their deaths.Once a fringe notion espoused by Israel’s far right, the idea the Jewish state would simply declare swaths of the Palestinian territories – where its settlements have been proliferating for decades – its own territory has over the past year marched into the mainstream.The Trump plan calls for the annexation to take place in consultation with Palestinian leaders, but it is unclear what conditions – if any – the White House would impose on the Netanyahu-Gantz government. The annexation was “an Israeli decision”, Mike Pompeo said recently.European leaders, the UN and scores of retired Israeli generals and security officials have voiced their objection to the plan, arguing that it would isolate Israel and pour petrol on the volatile region. It would also signal the death of the two-state solution, the 1994 outline for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians that has been the framework for all subsequent negotiations, but which many analysts argue has been on its deathbed for years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bcddff317088a390d9fb57da2be10c73c5e1ca3/0_137_4289_2574/master/4289.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18fd763e1737ec9b92638bf231495c32","title":"outdoor markets and car showrooms can open next week in england","story":"Boris Johnson says other non-essential retail premises can reopen in three weeksOutdoor markets and car showrooms will be allowed to reopen in England from Monday next week, while other non-essential retail premises will be allowed to open in three weeks’ time, Boris Johnson has announced.The prime minister set out a timeline for the reopening of outdoor retail settings first from 1 June, saying the risk of transmission of the virus was lower in open spaces. High street shops, department stores and shopping centres will all be allowed to open from 15 June as long as they can show they are “Covid secure”, he added.The prime minister said new guidance was being published for the sector “detailing the measures they should take to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards”.“Shops now have the time to implement this guidance before they reopen,” he said. “This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps they should take.”Johnson said the authorities would “have the powers we need to enforce compliance where that is required”.“I want people to be confident that they can shop safely provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises.”The non-essential retail outlets include shops selling clothes, shoes, toys, furniture, books, and electronics, plus tailors, auction houses, photography studios, and indoor markets, which will all have three weeks to prepare.The rules will not allow for the opening of hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons, or cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues, because the risk of transmission in these environments is higher where long periods of person-to-person contact is required.The government said businesses would only be able to open from these dates once they had completed a risk assessment, in consultation with trade union representatives or workers, and were confident they were managing the risks. To ensure safety, local authorities will continue to carry out spot checks and follow up on concerns by members of the public.Ministers will ask shops to take measures such as storing returned items for 72 hours before putting them back on the shop floor, placing protective coverings on large items touched by the public such as beds or sofas, and frequent cleaning of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, including self-checkouts, trolleys, coffee machines and betting terminals.Powers are in place to enforce action if the public and employees are not protected, including fines and jail sentences of up to two years.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said: “The high street sits at the heart of every community in the country. Enabling these businesses to open will be a critical step on the road to rebuilding our economy, and will support millions of jobs across the UK.“The guidance we have set out today provides a vital framework to get shops open in a way that is safe for everyone. It explains how retail workers who are not currently working can go back to work as safely as possible and feel confident in their workplace. And it reassures customers that shops are properly assessing the risks and putting in place measures to protect them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36502f53858cecb390134ca89dad648f0cdd8a85/0_367_885_531/master/885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f981599f25f564f6a266ca6eb3bbdc1a","title":"wernotvirus plays to highlight covid 19 racism against asians","story":"Project including monologues will be shown on Zoom to help expose ‘hidden problem’ in UKA series of plays and monologues will highlight the racism that east and south-east Asian communities in the UK are undergoing during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the producers hoping it will help expose the “hidden problem”.“It’s about making a statement,” said York Loh. “You can’t let this kind of thing happen and there be a gaping silence. Representation is so important because if you’re not visible in the media or culture the easier it is to dehumanise you.”Lim said members of her company who were working in south London before the lockdown was enforced experienced racial abuse while walking from the tube station to the theatre on three consecutive days. “We felt there was a real urgency to respond to the racism,” Lim said. “Theatre often takes a long time to respond to live issues and by the time they do the moment is gone.”The series will feature film, poetry, dance and song and will be directed by Jennifer Tang and Anthony Lau. Tang said WeRNotVirus was a chance for east and south-east Asian talent to speak out about racism related to Covid-19.“The reason it felt like this was such an important thing to do was that historically, traditionally – rightfully or wrongly – one thing the Chinese have been accused of is that we take everything and just keep our heads down,” said Tang.“This felt like a real opportunity to speak up and make known what it is we are going through at the moment and throw off this representation for being quiet and meek. This is a real opportunity to have our voices heard.”After the works have been broadcast there will be a panel discussion with east and south-east Asian academics, journalists and playwrights. The series will also feature work by the British-Nigerian playwright Oladipo Agboluaje about the experiences of Africans in China, where there has been a rise in coronavirus-related racism aimed at them.The project, which was awarded money from the Arts Council Emergency Fund, will be shown on Zoom over 13-14 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Boris Johnson again stands by his chief aide, despite his admission that he breached the lockdown. The UK’s prime minister seeks to move the public discourse on after days of damaging revelations about Dominic Cummings’ conduct. But his judgment is questioned by some.While he says he understands people’s anger, Cummings refuses to apologise and says he does not regret what he did.After weeks of seeking to avoid scrutiny, and in a highly unusual move, the unelected adviser uses No 10 as the backdrop for a personal press conference called, it is said, to give him a chance to explain his reasoning. For weeks, Downing Street had declined opportunities to substantively address questions about Cummings’ adherence to lockdown instructions.Seeking to explain his decision to drive his wife and young son to a local beauty spot from his parents’ residence, where he had taken the family during the lockdown, Cummings says he was unsure his eyesight was up to the drive to London and wanted to test it out. The prime minister later insists he believes the excuse to be plausible.The police and crime commissioner for Durham, Steve White, asks for an investigation to establish the facts around Cummings’ time in the area during the lockdown. The force earlier said it had received “further information and complaints from members of the public and we are reviewing and examining that information”.The World Health Organization says it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine – the malaria drug Donald Trump said he was taking as a precaution – from its global study into experimental treatments after safety concerns.Johnson says he is allowing outdoor markets and car showrooms to open because their open nature means they represent a lower risk than indoor places.Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker has counted a total of 5,467,945 confirmed infections. The death toll stands at 344,731.Health authorities’ reassessment brings the total number of deaths recorded to 26,834. A new system of gathering data had allowed them to identify cases that were counted twice and exclude deaths wrongly attributed to the virus, said Fernando Simón, the health ministry’s emergencies coordinator.Officials reported the figure in the country’s vast camps as the number of confirmed infections among them rose to 29. Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped settlements, housing almost a million Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar, and officials restricted movement to the area in April."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4262272.1590429804!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert students must register for calculated grades by thursday evening","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCalculated grades have been designed as a solution to problems with sitting the exams while adhering to safety guidelines related to Covid-19.

Photograph: iStockThe shock of Covid-19 shut down businesses across the country. Many people were able to keep working from home, but hairdressers, restaurants and cafes, clothes shops, garden centres and gyms were among the businesses that were forced to close their doors. The slowdown - and the economic hit that came with it - highlighted how business is the engine of the economy. The financial and banking sectors took a hit too. Shares and stocks fell as consumer confidence was eroded, people lost jobs and there wasn’t much to buy with shops closed. Aeroplanes were grounded. Global carbon emissions fell. Business is broad. You’ll find people with business degrees in restaurants, shops, transport, science, health, food and agriculture, law, entertainment, education and more. They’re working in a range of roles including accounting, banking, entrepreneurship, finance, human resources, insurance, management, sales and marketing. And, of course, people with business skills are working in financial services including banking, consumer finance firms, stockbroking and marketing and advertising firms. They’re also well equipped to set up their own enterprises.Empathy and compassionSamantha Kelly is an entrepreneur who started off with a product called Funky Goddess, a gift basket for young women who had had their first period. “I used Twitter and Facebook to market the business and I knew that, if I told stories and people told me theirs, they’d be more likely to buy the gift box.”Business can feel impersonal, but Kelly says that there is a real person behind every business or image. “In business, you need to be good at building relationships and that does take empathy and compassion. It’s not about being cutthroat and I don’t have people like that in my network. We work on mentoring and helping people by adding value and sharing knowledge.”Yes, employers might value a business degree but, more than that, they value key skills such as teamwork, creativity, enterprise, problem-solving and analytical skills - and courses that help students to develop these skills are worth a look. But students should also look to get involved in clubs and societies, running events, watching the money and working as part of a team. Courses that offer a work placement or work experience can also give students a leg-up, as can business courses that include an option to learn a foreign language whether as a core or optional module. ConsiderationsIn choosing the right business course, students should consider average class sizes, work experience and project work, the skills they want to develop - and whether to go for a broad, general entry course or whether to apply to a specialist course (such as marketing or supply chain management) from the outset. Ailbe Murphy, career guidance counsellor with studyclix.ie and a teacher at Jesus and Mary Secondary School in Enniscrone, Co Sligo, points out that students have hundreds of different options when it comes to business courses, including level six certificates, level seven ordinary degrees, level eight honours courses and PLC courses that may give a taster of the business world and guidance on the modules that are most interest to them. “Some students know what they want to do, whether that’s HR, business and law, ICT, entrepreneurship or perhaps commerce with a language. But if they’re not sure, a broad business or commerce degree gives an opportunity to sample a range of subjects in first year and then specialise in second year,” Murphy says.Students could also consider business apprenticeships. In recent years, Solas, the further education and training authority, have developed a suite of apprenticeships that including accounting technician (level six), insurance practice (level eight), international financial services associate (level six) and international financial services specialist (level eight).All of these courses give students a chance to earn money while they learn, so could be a great option for those concerned about the cost of college.

Photograph: Michael MacSweeneyProvisionAn old Cork graveyard is getting a makeover thanks to four goats who have been hired for the summer to eat overgrowth around headstones and boulders, rather than using strimmers and mowers.There, goats and sheep are used to keep churchyards trimmed, and walking paths clear for tourists, courtesy of their healthy appetites for ample local vegetation. Such landscaping is more environmentally friendly than using strimmers and tools, said Ms Buckley, particularly in old graveyards replete with fragile headstones.The goats have attracted considerable attention since they first arrived at St Matthew’s last week, with local children turning up with their parents to catch a glimpse of the animals.However, they took a while to settle in. “We only had two at the start. Harris and Oscar were just chilling out and not doing much because everyone was bringing apples to them,” said Ms Buckley.The goats came from Norah de Bara from Castletownbere, who added to the pair with a couple of wild goats from Hungry Hill that “took her nearly a week to catch”.“We will have them until September-October because it is rutting season and they will have to go back to their lassies down in Castletownbere then ,” she said.For now, the goats are “on trial” to the volunteers involved in the Templebreedy “Save Our Steeple” campaign, who have been leading conservation works at the 1788 church.Cork County Council has donated temporary fencing to keep the goats inside the graveyard. The fencing will be moved weekly as the four progress with their work over the summer.However, they will need to make a return trip next spring. “There is no way the graveyard will be done by September because it’s a couple of acres,” said Ms Buckley.The back of the cemetery, where the Hayes family of Crosshaven House are buried, is “full of brambles”, she said. “We would like to get a vision of what is there underneath.” Local children are being encouraged to come equipped with gloves and secateurs to cut brambles and ivy for the goats, rather than bringing them apples for treats.Local farmer Dave Walsh regularly checks on the goats, as do others. “This is a real community story. It wouldn’t work unless it was a community event. The community are watching them. This type of work is all very common in the states. The goats and sheep do a better job environmentally. It’s a no-brainer really,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4260462.1590181050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spanish archaeologists recover bones in search for remains of red hugh o donnell","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. Photograph: TwitterArchaeologists in Spain have found part of a skull and a femur (thigh bone) in their search for the remains of Red Hugh O’Donnell, one of the great tragic heroes of Irish history. O’Donnell died en-route to Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain, in July 1602 having failed to persuade the Spanish king Philip III to send another army to Ireland to fight against the English.On day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. A tweet from the city’s tourism and culture department read: “A part of the skull, a femur, and some more remains appear in what appears to be the access to the Chapel of the Marvels.”The city’s culture councillor Ana Redondo posted a shamrock emoji and the words “estamos cerca” - “we are close”. The archaeologists involved are also searching for the remains of Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 became the first European to discover the Americas.He was buried in the same place as O’Donnell. However, Columbus’s remains were allegedly removed and reburied in the cathedral of Seville and later in the Dominican Republic. Speaking on Friday, which was the 514th anniversary of the funeral of Columbus in Valladolid, chief archaeologist Óscar Burón said he believed that both O’Donnell and Columbus are “buried right under our feet and now we are concerned with checking whether the research we have undertaken is correct”. He described O’Donnell as an “Irish prince and the hero of the resistance against the English”. O’Donnell and his father-in-law Hugh Mor O’Neill, who between them controlled large parts of the north of Ireland, started the Nine Years War to drive the English out of Ireland.Battle of KinsaleIt began promisingly and the Irish won a number of significant victories, but eventually ended in defeat following the siege and then the Battle of Kinsale in late 1601 and early 1602.A combined force of Spanish and Irish troops was defeated by the English in one of the worst military setbacks in Irish history, after which Red Hugh fled to Spain.Though Philip III never did provide the soldiers requested by Red Hugh, he did give him the equivalent of a royal funeral as described in the Annals of the Four Masters.“His body was conveyed to the king’s palace at Valladolid in a four-wheeled hearse, surrounded by countless numbers of the king’s state officers, council, and guards, with luminous torches and bright flambeaux of beautiful wax-light burning on each side of him.” He was buried within the Chapel of Marvels in the grounds of the Franciscan convent in Valladolid. The convent disappeared in 1836 and with it O’Donnell’s remains.In a statement, Valladolid city council’s cultural department said finding the remains of O’ Donnell would be a “spur to the dissemination of this city abroad and also, of course, within Spain.“The burial in Valladolid of these two characters of such relevance to the world as is the case of Columbus and to relations between Spain and Ireland against their common enemy: England, demonstrate the importance of Spain and specifically of Valladolid for centuries.” On Thursday the team of archaeologists located other human bones, but not those of O’Donnell. They hope that his remains will be easy to identify as he lost the big toes on both of feet from frostbite after he escaped from prison in Dublin in December 1591. He fled into the Wicklow mountains in the depth of winter. His companion Art O’Neill froze to death in the escape.

The sector required a specific plan. We knew that Covid-19 disproportionately impacts on older people. The planning and focus was almost exclusively on our acute hospitals. Multiple clusters initially emerged in our hospitals. But the numbers in nursing homes started to increase.”Mr Daly is expected to tell the committee that in the absence of a national strategy and response for the nursing home sector, a number of challenges emerged. These included insufficient testing of residents and staff, mass shortfall of PPE and aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff initially by the HSE as well as discharges from acute hospitals to nursing homes without testing.According to his opening statement, Mr Daly says the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the authority responsible for the commissioning of nursing home care, “fell silent as homes incurred considerable and responsible costs to manage the pandemic. The Department of Health eventually intervened.”“Key State organisations left the nursing home sector and its residents isolated in those early days. The dismay will live forever with us.”The committee will also hear from representatives of the Sage advocacy group for vulnerable adults and older people.According to an opening statement for the group, the initial warning signs regarding a Covid-19 pandemic were generally recognised by private nursing homes.“However, because of the lack of effective working relationships with the HSE, and the focus at state level on an expected surge and resultant threat to the acute system, the dangers to the most vulnerable who were in nursing homes did not become centre stage until the systemic weaknesses of the outsourced system became clear.”The group says that “the development of such a significant ‘blind spot’ at statutory level is something that requires considerable reflection.”The advocacy group will also say that in the absence of a robust testing system it is “most likely that there would have been some transfers of Covid-19 positive patients into nursing homes.”Furthermore, staff shortages in some cases led to “risk taking with staff in some facilities having to continue to work while ill and in other cases encouraging people back from isolation.”“Other staff, frightened for their own health and aware of the Covid-19 payments, chose to stay away with the result that some nursing homes were so short staffed that phone calls from extremely concerned and distressed relatives went unanswered in some cases for days.”It will say, “staff transfers from the public sector to the private sector were on a voluntary basis, negotiations took up valuable time and delivered little. From the perspective of one person involved, ‘The cavalry never came’.”Speaking in advance of the hearing, Sinn Féin TD Louise O’Reilly said “the opening statement from Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) for the Oireachtas Covid19 Committee reveals the failure of the Government and the HSE to put a proper plan in place for nursing homes before they became gripped by the Covid crisis.“It further points out that planning and the cost of managing the pandemic fell on the shoulders of nursing homes and how the Department of Health only belatedly intervened.“The whole statement points to a complete failure of the State to enact a structural plan for the nursing home sector, with the necessary financial and staffing resources, until late in the day.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Commissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentIf Travis McCready\u0026rsquos US event goes ahead, it will look very different from typical rock gigsCity looks asymptomatic carriers after confirming first Covid cluster last weekend since release from lockdownLeader missed out on a seat as the venue was too full under Covid-19 restrictionsSecond most senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism was taken into custody when he was sixAid groups warn a humanitarian disaster looms in camps housing one million peopleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4262191.1590423853!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"trusting the advice of experts and politicians amid this pandemic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDutch prime minister Mark Rutte (left) visits a hairdresser in The Hague, on May 14th as the country eased lockdown measures. File photograph: GettyP J O’Rourke is one of those writers whose books have never quite lived up to their titles. But who cares? You’ve got to love anything named Holidays in Hell, Give War A Chance, The CEO of the Sofa, or my current topical favourite, Age and Guile Beat Youth, Innocence and a Bad Haircut.What brought the American political satirist to mind was that Dutch barber shops reopened last week as part of the easing of the coronavirus lockdown, raising the question of whether the time was right to succumb to the demands of vanity, even for those of us (marginally) over 60.In other words – to date myself even more precisely – like the wonderfully menacing Laurence Olivier, dentist’s drill in hand, looming over a terrified young Dustin Hoffman in the ’70s classic, Marathon Man, I needed to know before I took a potentially lethal risk, is it safe?The thing about the Dutch is that they’re a pretty no-nonsense people who generally trust the advice of their politicians and experts in matters of life and death.Hence the soaring personal ratings of prime minister Mark Rutte, whose party is nine seats up in polling since the pandemic began the pretty universal derision for Donald Trump and his crackpot cures, and the new term of contempt for those who bang on endlessly about the virus without having a notion what they’re talking about – toogviroloog or “blather virologist”.Another example of that tell-it-like-it-is approach is the public health guidance to single adults that they should consider “mutually satisfactory arrangements” with temporary “sex buddies” as an aid to mental health while the crisis continues – an issue which, to be best of my knowledge, hasn’t yet been raised in daily briefings in Dublin or London.So, with schools, restaurants, cafes and even cinemas due to reopen from June 1st, one might imagine that hairdressers, barber shops and nail salons would be a relatively straightforward proposition: masks, regular disinfection, hand sanitisers, social distancing, and limited conversation?All correct, I was told when I contacted my regular barber shop, except that masks were not required. There was no evidence that they worked. They weren’t being worn by the barbers. Nor were customers required to wear them.That, I was assured, was the national guidance: “If you feel healthy, come in. If you don’t feel healthy, don’t come in.”So what, I asked – having armed myself unfairly in advance – about the fact that contagiousness begins, on average, 2.3 days before symptoms emerge and peaks 0.7 days before, and that as a result, in four out of 10 cases, coronavirus is spread by those not obviously ill?That, as I expected, was a question too far and we reverted cordially to the national guidance: “If you feel healthy, come in, and if you don’t feel healthy, don’t come in.”It must have been the effects of lockdown, but I could have sworn I heard Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry in the background, taunting, “Well, do you feel healthy, punk?”Clint’s scepticism was right on the money. Because, although despite my misgivings, I went ahead there and then and booked my slot for Friday last at 3.15pm, I subsequently cracked on Wednesday afternoon and phoned back to cancel, offering to pay for the inconvenience.What decided me? The absence of masks, first. But more than that, it was the return of driving tests, an interesting case where social distancing can’t work between student and tester, and screens were ruled out because they would prevent the tester from taking control of the car in a crisis.The explanation? “We gave a lot of thought to this,” said the boss of the driving authority. “In the end we decided that if applicants can state clearly that they’re not sick and are abiding by hygiene measures, that should be enough.”“No, it shouldn’t,” I shouted at the radio, lifting the phone to cancel my haircut in protest.Did I cancel it? No, I did not.My hairdresser got in first and told me he too had had a rethink. He would wear a mask especially for me – and in fact would also provide one for me to wear. Risk on, as investors say.So, there were two of us in the shop last Friday wearing masks and four others – two barbers and their customers – without them.It was a new experience for both of us. Whether it made any sense, I had no idea in the end.I guess that’s what’s known as “going Dutch” in a pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Prime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeCases in region limited to 17 with no deaths recorded thanks to effective quarantineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"cannonball run record repeatedly shattered us highways empty","story":"When a team of three hurtled across the US at an average speed of 103 mph last year, many believed their Cannonball Run record of 27 hours and 25 minutes would remain intact for years.Then came the coronavirus lockdown which saw highways across the US empty, leaving the roads free for speed-freaks while millions of Americans complied with stay-at-home orders.The temptation of taking on the challenge, which dates back to the early 1970s, has proved irresistible.In just a couple of months the record in the race, popularised in a 1981 film starring Burt Reynolds, has been shattered seven times.A driver, calling him – or herself – Captain Chaos got the journey time down to 26 hours and 38 minutes in an Audi 8 – at an average speed of 106 mph.Now there are unconfirmed reports of at least one motorist – or team - completing the journey from the Red Ball Garage in Manhattan to the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach, California in under 26 hours.Speed limits are ignored by contestants in the unofficial race, which sees drivers putting their pedal to the metal as they race along deserted straight highways.Dodging speed traps and evading highway patrols is arguably as important as souping up an engine for cannonballers.Some reportedly use GPS devices and spotters to scan the road for police cars. They have also carried tanks of fuel to minimise the number of pit stops.Ed Bolian, a former Cannonball Run record holder, described the speeds reached by the latest teams as unreal.Certainly, we had some over 110 mph averages through states, they were over 120 mph through several states.How long this record will stand remains to be seen. But with the lockdowns being gradually lifted, the roads are unlikely to be as empty again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings says did nothing wrong refuses apologise lockdown","story":"Dominic Cummings last night insisted he had no regrets over his behaviour during lockdown and had done nothing wrong by driving 260 miles to stay on his parents’ farm.In an extraordinary hour-long press conference, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser refused to apologise for taking his wife and son to Durham and repeatedly said he had not broken any rules.He said he knew British people “hate the idea of unfairness”, adding: “I believe I made the right judgment but I can understand that others may disagree with that.”After three days of damaging headlines, Mr Cummings was ordered by the Prime Minister to make the unprecedented live television appearance in the hope that he would draw a line under the growing scandal. But he also made a series of admissions likely to draw further scrutiny of his decisions.Mr Cummings said he had not offered his resignation to the Prime Minister nor had he considered doing so, despite calls from more than 20 Conservative MPs for him to quit.He said he had first told Mr Johnson he was in Durham several days into his 14-day stay there, but that both of them were too ill “to remember the conversation in any detail”.Mr Cummings also confessed that he and the Government had made mistakes in their handling of the coronavirus crisis since January, but chose not to detail what they were.His appearance in the garden of No 10 won over some Tory MPs, including Mark Spencer, the Chief Whip, who said he had given a “full, frank, honest and open statement” proving he acted within the rules and that it was “time to move on”.Other MPs, however, said they would wait to see how their constituents responded before passing judgment.Tory MPs nationwide have been bombarded with messages from constituents demanding to know why Mr Cummings has not been sacked and, with a growing sense of rebellion within the party, Mr Cummings was sent out by the Prime Minister to explain his actions.He said he had decided to go to Durham after his wife fell ill and he feared that no one would be able to look after their four-year-old son while he was at work. In the event, he himself fell ill the next day, meaning the family had to spend 14 days in self-isolation.Asked if he felt he should apologise or regretted what he had done, he said: “I don’t regret what I did … I think what I did was actually reasonable in these circumstances. The rules made clear that if you are dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances.” He added: “I don’t think I’m so different, and I don’t think there’s one rule for me and one rule for other people … there is no regulation covering the situation I found myself in.”Mr Cummings confirmed he had made a 60-mile round trip from Durham to Barnard Castle with his wife and son on April 12, in an apparent breach of the lockdown rules, but said it was effectively a test run to see if he was up to driving back to London the next day.Asked if he understood why people were angry with his behaviour and had called for his resignation, he said: “I can understand that some people will argue that I should have stayed at home in London throughout.“I understand these views, I know the intense hardship and sacrifice the entire country has had to go through. However, I respectfully disagree.”Mr Johnson said at his own Downing Street press conference later: “I do regret the confusion and the anger and the pain that people have been suffering and that’s why I did want people to understand exactly what had happened.“I tried yesterday to explain my version of what I had heard from Dominic Cummings but I couldn’t go into the detail that people wanted to hear and that’s why we had the statement today.”He added: “People will have to make their minds up. I think he came across as someone who cares very much about his family.“Reasonable people may disagree with his actions but I don’t think reasonable people will disagree with what was going through his head.”Asked if Mr Cummings had his “unconditional” support, Mr Johnson said: “I can’t give unconditional backing to anybody but I don’t believe anybody in Number 10 has done anything to undermine our message.”Among the members of the Cabinet who publicly backed Mr Cummings last night was Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, who said: “Dom Cummings was right today to set out in full detail how he made his decisions in very difficult circumstances. Now we must move on, fight this dreadful disease and get our country back on her feet.”However, Mr Cummings’s public statement did nothing to silence the calls from opposition parties for him to resign.A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The British people were looking for at least an apology from Dominic Cummings for breaking the lockdown. They got none.“Millions of people have made extraordinary sacrifices during the lockdown.“Families have been forced apart, sometimes in the most tragic of circumstances. They stayed at home to protect the NHS and save lives.“And yet, the message from this Government is clear: it’s one rule for Boris Johnson’s closest adviser, another for everybody else.”Ian Blackford, SNP Westminster Leader, said it was now “beyond doubt Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must not let china use covid cover hong kong power grab","story":"There’s something happening in China and the West needs to pay attention.

What’s happening now is a far more brazen, more aggressive, more open flouting of international law. This week, the Communist Party of China submitted a draft resolution to its parliament. So far, so procedural. But the resolution seeks to impose a new national security law on the City of Hong Kong and the parliament – only ever a rubber stamping exercise – is sure to pass it.It seeks to criminalise secession, subversion and terrorism, along with any activities by foreign forces that interfere with Hong Kong. The way the Chinese authorities work, the resolution is passed first and the fleshing out of various remits, actions and consequences comes later, so Hong Kong’s worried citizenry will need to wait to find out exactly how much of a power grab this is. Nerves are already frayed at the suggestion the Ministry of State Security – sometimes referred to as ‘China’s KGB’ – will be opening an office in the city. The moves are enough to have prompted street protests in Hong Kong and, internationally, more than 200 politicians and policymakers from 23 countries to sign a statement denouncing Beijing’s action. China will be delighted, however, that a world media buried deep in COVID coverage, has left such a move off the front pages and afforded it much less prominence than protests last year in response to new extradition law.But this is a far more egregious act and demands a swift and united response. When the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China happened in 1997, the two sides drew up a treaty protecting Hong Kongers’ freedoms – freedom of assembly, of speech and to exercise democracy in its own way. It also enshrined Hong Kong’s independent judiciary and codified that the city was responsible for its own security. These are freedoms enjoyed nowhere else in China and the Joint Declaration was an official international treaty, lodged with the United Nations and had a writ that was to run until 2047. This week’s power play by China – while the world’s attention was elsewhere – drives a cart and horses through international law. It makes a mockery of the “One Country, Two Systems” promises made to the people of Hong Kong as handover occurred.But the international community in general, and the United Kingdom in particular, are not powerless to act.  Firstly, this needs to be put firmly on the agenda of the next G7 meeting. As former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten, has argued, continuing to allow China to act without sanction or rebuke only encourages more aggressive behaviour and makes future action that much more difficult.And, closer to home, the United Kingdom should make good on its responsibilities to Hong Kong’s people. In the 1980s Hong Kongers’ status changed from the same as that of any other British Citizens to citizens of British dependent Territories, stripping them of residency rights. When handover happened, that status changed again to British Nationals (Overseas) citizens – enjoying a UK passport and consular support, but no right to live and work long term in the UK.However the level of fear running up to the handover created concerns of mass emigration from Hong Kong, threatening the city’s stability and the function of its institutions. So the UK changed its decision (again) and reinstated full British citizenship for certain key figures – judges, senior police officers etc – deemed essential to the good governance of the city. Betting that by enshrining the ability to leave at any time, most of these figures would choose to stay. They did.  And something of the same needs to happen now. China’s sustained erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong - backed by force - is making the city’s citizens nervous once again.  Nearby Taiwan has already seen an 150pc increase in Hong Kongers seeking refuge in the country during the first four months of 2020 and a presidential offer of  all “necessary assistance”. But the country with the historic and moral responsibility to act here is the UK.  As the situation deteriorates, it’s a position that’s gaining ground in Westminster. Tom Tugendhat, the energetic chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee argues “The UK had obligations to Hong Kong citizens before 1997, and the extension of overseas citizenship, which is in many ways a second-tier citizenship, was a mistake, and I think it’s one that should be corrected.At a time when there are clearly tensions in Hong Kong, the UK could reassure many Hong Kong citizens that their existing rights are recognised by the UK, and they are valued.” It is complicated, however, as Tugendhat admits “These are still Chinese citizens from the special autonomous region, so I don’t think the Chinese government would see them as anything other than Chinese citizens under a slightly different status.”Indeed, under international law, the UK can’t simply spray the populace of Hong Kong with UK passports and declare that everyone living there is now British. However, what it can do is change the domestic rules for those already holding British Citizenship (Overseas) passports. By allowing people in this group, for example, the right to live and work in the UK for up to ten years, it will settle the nerves of those in Hong Kong, wary of what China chooses to do next. It shows China that Britain is not afraid to underwrite the freedoms that Hong Kongers enjoy and, for those who do choose to come to the UK, after five years they can apply for indefinite leave to remain and for citizenship.

I am wildly, flourishingly, dementedly jealous of anyone with even the smallest, parchedest patch of outdoor space. Reading reports over the Bank Holiday weekend that one billionaire (Canadian) had sold his London townhouse to another billionaire (Russian) for £15million sparked the immediate, envious thought: bet they’ve got a garden.The house was sold on the strength of a virtual tour. No poking in cupboards, no embarrassed inspection of the downstairs loo.Naturally, (nosily), I went straight on the Beauchamp Estates website for a good goggle at the house. Apart from the fabulous showers – bigger than my kitchen – the house is blander than a dentist’s waiting room. Every monster sofa and leopard-print stool is separated by a barren tundra of tufted white carpet.

He was worried that if both he and his wife fell ill there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid.The couple decided that, instead of asking family and friends in London, they would decamp to Durham where his sister and two nieces had offered to look after his son if necessary.“In that scenario, what would be best for everybody, wouldn\u0027t it be best for a 17-year-old niece, to walk 50 metres and look after our child, or would it be best for me to be here? And, and call 999?” he said.He said he had looked at official lockdown guidance published in March that banned people with coronavirus symptoms from leaving their home, but crucially in his view added: If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.Mr Cummings said: To me, the rules are there, they talk about what to do, they talk about exceptional circumstances and small children.I was trying to weigh up on that Friday night, conflicting things between what happens if we\u0027re both ill, who\u0027s going to look after him, what\u0027s the safest way of doing that?”Mr Cummings said that he had not asked the Prime Minister about his decision to leave for Durham and admitted that “arguably this was a mistake”.“I did not ask the Prime Minister about this decision. He was ill himself and he had huge problems to deal with, Mr Cummings said. “The Prime Minister’s time is just about the most valuable commodity that exists in the Government. The honest truth about my job is that there are endless problems all day long, and I can\u0027t go to him all day, asking him \u0027what do you think about that\u0027, \u0027what do you think about the other\u0027 otherwise what\u0027s the point of having people like me around?”“I have to get on with things. I have to make decisions, and sometimes I do the right thing and sometimes I make mistakes.“Arguably this was a mistake and I understand that some will say that I should have spoken to the Prime Minister before deciding what to do.”The week after arriving in Durham, Mr Cummings said he did inform the Prime Minister of his whereabouts while they were both sick with the virus. Neither of the men recall the conversion in detail because they were both “in bad shape”, Mr Cummings said.The next time the matter was discussed between Mr Cummings and his boss was when journalists confronted Downing Street with the allegations on Friday evening, he said.Mr Cummings said that over the weekend of March 28-29, he and his family moved into a small cottage made from “concrete blocks” around 50m from his parents’ main residence.“The next day, I got extremely ill,” he said. “A couple of days later I couldn\u0027t look after a child... I could barely move to be honest.”His wife Mary, however, had recovered to the extent that she could continue looking after their young son.“I got worse, she got better,” Mr Cummings said. “After I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house,” he continued.“At one point the three of us walked into woods, owned by my father. Some people saw us in these woods from a distance, but we had no interaction with them. We had not left the property, we were on private land,” he said.The only conversations he had with his parents - who are both in their 70s - were “shouted from a distance”.“My parents are in their 70s. Obviously I do not want to give them this disease,” he said.During the night of Thursday April 2, Mr Cummings said his child woke up, vomited and had a bad fever. “He was very distressed,” Mr Cummings said.The couple took medical advice and called 999. An ambulance arrived to take the young boy to hospital around four miles away, but Mr Cummings was too ill to travel.“I said you must go to hospital. I could barely stand up,” Mr Cummings said. “My wife travelled with him in the ambulance. I stayed at home.” Mr Cummings’ son stayed the night in the hospital, and in the morning, Mary called to say that their child appeared to have recovered.“He was seen by two doctors who tested him for Covid and said that they should return home,” he said.“There were no taxis. I drove to the hospital, picked them up, then returned home. I did not leave the car, or have any contact with anybody at any point on the short trip.”A few days later the hospital called to say the boy had tested negative for Covid.Mr Cummings claimed that he drove to the market town of Barnard Castle on Sunday April 12 to test his eyesight before making the long trip back to London.He had consulted with medical experts the day before, who told him it was safe to return to work.“I was involved in decisions affecting millions of people, and I thought I should try to help as much as I could (by returning to London),” he said.“But I\u0027d been extremely ill. My vision had been a bit weird,” he said. “We were all going to go back. My wife said we should drive down the road and you should see if you can actually drive, and see if your vision is weird or if you\u0027re okay. She didn’t want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child. And I thought, that\u0027s a good idea. I should do,” he said.The family then made the 44-minute journey to Barnard Castle, and “ended up on the outskirts”, he said. I wasn\u0027t sightseeing, I didn\u0027t go to the castle, he said.“We parked by a river. My wife and I discussed the situation. We agreed that I could drive safely. We should turn around and go home,” he said. “I felt a bit sick. We walked about 10 to 15 metres from the car to the riverbank nearby. We sat there for about 15 minutes. No interactions with anybody. I felt better. “We returned to the car, and an elderly gentleman walking nearby appeared to recognise me. My wife wished him happy Easter from a distance, but we had no other interaction.” On the way back to his parents’ farm, his child said he needed the toilet.“My wife and child jumped out into the woods by the side of the road. They were briefly outside, I briefly joined them. They played for a little bit. “We saw some people at a distance, but at no point did we break any social distancing rules. We then got back in the car and went home.”The following evening, Mr Cummings and his family returned to London, stopping for petrol along the way. Mr Cummings went back to work in Downing Street the next day.Asked whether he should have made the journey without the test run to Castle Barnard, Mr Cummings replied: “I mean, perhaps you\u0027re right and we should just have cracked on and tried to do the whole trip. But as I said, I think it was a reasonable thing to do.” Mr Cummings denied reports that he had returned to Durham after coming back to London. One witness said they had recognised him by his trademark beanie hat, and had overheard him remarking that the bluebells are lovely during a walk in Hougham Woods on April 19.But Mr Cummings said: “Data on my phone would prove this to be false, and local CCTV if it exists, would also prove that I\u0027m telling the truth that I was in London. On that day, I was not in Durham.”He also attacked “media reports” that his behaviour had been affected by the death of his maternal uncle, Lord Justice Laws, on the day he travelled to Durham.It came after his mother told the New Statesman magazine that they had been “a grieving family, and there\u0027s been no recognition of that”.But Mr Cummings said: “During this two-week period, my mother\u0027s brother died with Covid. The media reports this had some influence on my behaviour. These reports are false. It did not affect my movements, none of us saw him. None of us attended his funeral.Mr Cummings admitted that he had made a series of mistakes over the handling of coronavirus, but insisted his trip to Durham had not been one of them.He said questions on government policy would be better directed at the Prime Minister, but said he personally had made errors “every day”.“I don\u0027t think what I did in these 14 days was a mistake, but I certainly made a lot of other mistakes. I know that I\u0027ve made mistakes in dealing with this thing going right back to January,” he said.He denied, however, reports from earlier in the year that he had argued behind the scenes against enforcing lockdown measures.“For years I\u0027ve warned of the dangers of pandemics,” he said. “Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning. The truth is that I\u0027d argued for lockdown. I did not oppose it.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"normal people star raffle connells chain charity","story":"Normal People star Paul Mescal is raffling off his chain in order to raise money for a suicide prevention charity.The actor, who plays Connell Waldron in the hit BBC Three series, said that the chain he wears in the programme had got a following of its own.The chain, which has its own Instagram fan page, got plenty of airtime in the numerous intimate moments between Connell and Marianne, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones.The series, which is adapted from Sally Rooney\u0027s 2018 Man Booker longlisted novel, was watched by 16 million people in its first week on the BBC iPlayer.The chain is being raffled in aid of Pieta, which is an Irish charity that provides support to people who are suicidal or engaging in self-harm.Mescal said: I am delighted to be able to help out Pieta by raffling off my chain that has taken on a following of its own since Normal People hit television screens.Pieta is a cause very close to my heart, having experienced loss due to suicide in my local town while growing up.He added that the series touches upon depression and suicidal ideation, so it seemed like a very special partnership to want to help those in similar situations.I want to play my part in helping sustain these free services across Ireland, Mescal said.The raffle opened on Monday and runs until June 8.More than €9,000 (about £8,000) has been raised by the charity initiative so far.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/23/11/hertz-car-rental.jpg","title":"hertz car hire bankruptcy coronavirus stock price","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘No business is built for zero revenue,’ says firm’s former chief executive.\u0026nbsp‘There’s only so long that companies’ reserves will carry them’The 102-year-old car rental company Hertz has filed for bankruptcy after the coronavirus pandemic caused business to nosee.At the end of March, the firm was $18.7 billion (£15.3 billion) in debt with only $1 billion (£820 million) of available cash.Hertz, which has over 400 outlets across the UK and Ireland, recently cut 12,000 staff from its global workforce and put another 4,000 on furlough. Chief executive Kathryn Marinello resigned last week following reports of possible bankruptcy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company lost all revenue from mid-March when the global travel industry came to a shuddering halt. Much of the firm’s income is sourced from car rentals at airports but it started missing debt payments in April.Ms Marinello said at the company’s first-quarter earnings conference on 12 May: “No business is built for zero revenue. There’s only so long that companies’ reserves will carry them.”Why businesses should think about going flight-freeBusinesses are a bit more optimistic, but we\u0027re heading for recessionHow the Government is helping UK businesses in the Covid-19 crisisNew insolvency law to stop businesses going bust during pandemicIn the company’s first-quarter report earlier this month with securities regulators, Hertz warned it may not be able to repay or refinance debt and may not have enough cash to continue operations.The report said: “Management has concluded there is substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of this quarterly report.”Hertz said in a statement on Friday: “The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company’s revenue and future bookings.“Hertz took immediate actions to prioritise the health and safety of employees and customers, eliminate all non-essential spending and preserve liquidity.“However, uncertainty remains as to when revenue will return and when the used-car market will fully re-open for sales, which necessitated today’s action. The financial reorganisation will provide Hertz a path toward a more robust financial structure that best positions the company for the future as it navigates what could be a prolonged travel and overall global economic recovery.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The challenge now is to understand the processes in Earth\u0027s core driving theses changes.One possibility, according to the ESA, is that the weakening field is a sign that the Earth\u0027s magnetic field is about to reverse, whereby the North Pole and South Pole switch places.The last time a geomagnetic reversal took place was 780,000 years ago, with some scientists claiming that the next one is long overdue. Typically, such events take place every 250,000 years.The repercussions of such an event could be significant, as the Earth\u0027s magnetic field plays an important role in protecting the planet from solar winds and harmful cosmic radiation. Telecommunication and satellite systems also rely on it to operate, suggesting that computers and mobile phones could experience difficulties.The South Atlantic Anomaly is already causing issues with satellites orbiting Earth, the ESA warned, while spacecrafts flying in the area could also experience technical malfunctions.A 2018 study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that despite the weakening field, Earth\u0027s magnetic field is probably not reversing.The study also explained that the process is not an instantaneous one and could take tens of thousands of years to take place.ESA said it would continue to monitor the weakening magnetic field with its constellation of Swarm satellites.The mystery of the origin of the South Atlantic Anomaly has yet to be solved, the space agency stated. However, one thing is certain: magnetic field observations from Swarm are providing exciting new insights into the scarcely understood processes of Earth\u0027s interior.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re always experimenting with future concepts using different hardware configurations as part of our proof-of-experience process” Bozworth also tweeted.Virtual reality is content computer-generated in three dimensions in a digital environment, while augmented reality – or mixed reality – is digital content layered over a real-world environment, such as Pokemon Go.The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that half of its workforce will likely work remotely over the next five to ten years.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way, he said. But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years — maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range — I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.“VR and AR is all about giving people remote presence. So if you’re long on VR and AR and on video chat, you have to believe in some capacity that you’re helping people be able to do whatever they want from wherever they are. So I think that that suggests a worldview that would lead to allowing people to work more remotely over time.” What has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?Facebook wants to build a ‘hateful meme’ AI to clean up its platformFacebook’s Oculus is developing a new Quest VR headsetThe company also published a blog post  saying that it would create a “super-powered augmented workspace with multiple customizable screens in VR, unbounded from the limits of ​physical monitors.”It would use Passthrough – a technology used on Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality hardware that lets you “temporarily step outside VR to see a real-time view of the world around you” - to let people switch between their real and virtual worlds with the hope that by “combining the flexibility of new inputs like hand tracking with the familiarity of everyday input devices like a keyboard and mouse, we could give people the best of both worlds.”The company is also developing virtual avatars called Codec Avatars which would “let people in the future create lifelike virtual avatars of themselves quickly and easily, helping social connections in virtual reality become as natural and common as those in the real world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The companies added to the US government’s Industry and Security Bureau’s “Entity List” were accused of “human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high technology surveillance against the Uighurs, Kazakhs, an other members of the Muslim minority groups” in the region.

Russia has been pushing for greater facial-recognition in the capital yet has a questionable history with the technology, including criticisms that CCTV footage has been hidden to obscure political crimes.Hikvision allegedly sold Chinese authorities 1,000 facial recognition cameras to be placed in mosques in Xinjiang so Uighurs could reportedly be better monitored.Wyden asks colleagues to limit FBI surveillanceAmazon also hosts the NSO Group, a spyware provider from Israel which has been repeatedly criticised for its involvement in spying on human rights workers, hacking hundreds of phones via WhatsApp  and is currently mapping coronavirus cases. Microsoft provides the web hosting capabilities and the email support for Ntech Labs, as well as allowing SenseTime to host emails on its Azure cloud computing service. Sensetime was found to be the supplier of equipment to officials in Xinjiang, where Muslims are reportedly held in internment camps, alongside Megvii, which also uses Microsoft Azure.“Our research shows that Google, Amazon and Microsoft continue to help some of the world\u0027s most controversial technology companies stay online. Many of the companies in our report have faced serious allegations of human rights violations and are known to have sold their invasive surveillance technology to authoritarian regimes around the world,” Samuel Woodhams, co-author of the report, told the Independent. “Despite this, US companies continue to provide them with essential web services, allowing them to continue promoting their technology without restriction. The report also shows that attempts by the Trump administration to decouple the American and Chinese technology sectors have so far been relatively limited in their success.”We have reached out to Google, Microsoft, and Amazon for comment.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo 10 have said the visit he made to Durham was  “essential”. In the first official comment since it emerged that the prime minister’s chief adviser had apparently flouted lockdown rules, Downing Street said his actions were “in line” with the guidelines.

Split into more than 80 wards containing 42 beds each, the facility will be used to treat Covid-19 patients who have been transferred from other intensive care units across London. Defending Mr Cummings, a No 10 spokesman said:  “Owing to his wife being infected with suspected Coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for. His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside. At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.”Members of the cabinet also defended Mr Cummings.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, tweeted: “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, wrote in a similar vein: “It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this. And it has been provided: two parents with Coronavirus, were anxiously taking care of their young child. Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.”Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, added: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.” Opposition politicians have accused No 10 of a ‘cover up’ after reports some in Downing Street knew Mr Cummings had made the 260-mile journey during lockdown.Labour have called on Boris  Johnson to say whether or not he sanctioned the trip.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that Mr Johnson had questions to answer  and should fire his chief adviser immediately. Police have confirmed they visited a property in County Durham after Mr Cummings made the  trip from his London home.

He called on Mr Johnson to state publicly if he believed Mr Cummings had adhered to the rules. “It’s clearly a matter of public interest - lockdown has been heartbreaking for so many families,  this looks like one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for everyone else,” he said.  The details of Mr Cumming’s trip were revealed by the Daily Mirror and the . A neighbour told the papers Mr Cummings was seen in the garden, while Abba\u0027s Dancing Queen was playing loudly. Durham police confirmed officers had spoken to the owners of an address after reports a person had travelled there from London.A spokesman said: On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the inidual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.Senior members of Mr Johnson’s own party expressed concern Mr Cumming’s journey could endanger the government’s plans to lift the lockdown. Former Tory cabinet minister  David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy prime minister, told Newsnight: There\u0027s clearly serious questions that No 10 are going to have to address, not least because the readiness of members of the public to follow government guidance more generally is going to be affected by this sort of story.Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a government adviser for flouting the rules when he was visited at this home by his girlfriend. At the time Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he was speechless and said he backed any police action against Mr Ferguson.Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Cummings to quit over the allegations, while a spokesman for Labour said: The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.He told the BBC Mr Johnson had serious questions to answer. “Did he sanction this? Did he say “this is ok”?”Allies of Mr Cummings said he was  not “remotely bothered” by the story, calling it “fake news”. There is zero chance of him resigning.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He had sat by the river in order to recover from a brief bout of sickness and was seen with his wife and child in a nearby wood because they had stopped the car to allow the young boy to relieve himself when he needed the toilet, he said.Covid-19 has not previously been linked to damage to eyesight, but Boris Johnson suggested that he too experienced problems with his vision following his own bout of coronavirus.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Staff react outside Salford Royal

think because of the effects of this thing. So I\u0027m inclined to think that\u0027s very, very plausible, that eyesight can be a problem associated with coronavirus.However, it is not the first time the PM has complained of poor vision. In 2014, he told an interviewer: I’m now so short-sighted, I’m blind! My eyes used to be fantastic but now…Giving his account of the visit to Barnard Castle in a press conference in the 10 Downing Street garden, Mr Cummings said that he had wanted to return to London to rejoin colleagues working on the government\u0027s coronavirus response, and had sought medical advice and been told it was safe for him to do so.But he said his wife was particularly concerned because his eyesight appeared to have been affected by the coronavirus infection which had left him in bed for much of the previous fortnight.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?My wife was very worried, particularly because my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease, he said.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailWe agreed to go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely. I drove for roughly half an hour and we ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town.We didn\u0027t visit the castle, we didn\u0027t walk around the town. We parked by a river.My wife and I discussed the situation, we agreed I could drive safely and we turn around and go home.I felt a bit sick. We walked about 10-15 metres from the car to the riverbank nearby. We sat there for 15 minutes and had no interactions with anybody. I felt better, we returned to the car.An elderly gentleman walking nearby appeared to recognise me. My wife wished him Happy Easter from a distance but we had no other interaction.Mr Cummings said that he and his wife set off for home, but within minutes their son was demanding the toilet.My wife and child jumped out into the woods at the side of the road. They were briefly outside. I briefly joined them. They played for a little bit. I got out of the car and we were briefly in the woods.We saw some people at a distance, but at no point did we breach any social distancing rules. We then got back in the car and went home.He said that they then returned to London on the evening of 13 April and he went back to work the following day.But there were questions about why, if he was concerned that his poor eyesight made him unfit to drive, he had taken his wife and child with him on the drive to Barnard Castle.Asked why he had decided to take the hour-long round trip rather than simply setting off for London and seeing whether he could cope with the driving, Mr Cummings said: I\u0027d been very ill. On Sunday the 12th, I said to my wife \u0027Let\u0027s pack up the car and go back. I\u0027ve been cleared by doctors to go back to work\u0027.She said - and I think it was perfectly reasonable - \u0027A few days ago you could barely stand up. You said that your eyesight was weird. We shouldn\u0027t just embark on a 270-mile journey and then find out halfway through that you actually can\u0027t drive that far. So we should get in the car and see if you can actually drive\u0027.The only way to avoid this problem would have been to say we would stay in Durham, which I could have done but I didn\u0027t think was the right thing to do.I\u0027d been told by expert medical advice that I wasn\u0027t a danger to the public and I could go back to work in Downing Street on Monday and I was trying to do that in the safest way possible. I think that was a reasonable thing to do.He said that he and his wife had not considered heading towards London to find out how he coped, but instead decided Let\u0027s just whizz down the road and see how I feel.He added: Do I regret not just trying to drive to London and seeing if I could do it? Perhaps we should have just cracked on and tried to do the whole trip, but the whole point was I had been extremely ill, my vision had been a bit weird, my wife said \u0027We should drive down the road and see if your vision is weird or if you\u0027re OK\u0027 and I thought \u0027That\u0027s a good idea\u0027.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

During an extraordinary press conference in the rose garden of Downing Street, Mr Cummings also admitted what appeared to be second clear breach of the rules when he said he had taken a 30 mile trip to a beauty spot while in County Durham. Despite calls from more than a dozen Tory MPs for his head, Boris Johnson’s most senior adviser said he had not considered standing down over the controversy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast night a number of cabinet ministers lined up to publicly support Mr Cummings, for the second time in three days. But rank-and-file Tory MPs reported that Mr Cummings’s statement had failed to win over their constituents.The four most puzzling lines from Dominic Cummings statementOne MP told The Independent they had received a flood of angry emails in the wake of Mr Cummings’s attempt to explain his actions. Even an announcement by Mr Johnson that shops in England would reopen in the middle of next month appeared to do little to stem public anger over his most senior adviser’s behaviour.During more than an hour of questions from the press, Mr Cummings said: “I don’t regret what I did. I think reasonable people may well disagree about how I thought about what to do in the circumstances, but I think what I did was actually reasonable in these circumstances.”He said he hoped that people would understand his actions once they knew the “very complex situation” he was facing. The 30 mile trip to Barnard Castle was to test his eyesight, he said, ahead of a long drive back to London. Mr Cummings was concerned his sight had been affected when he came down with Covid-19 symptoms in Durham, he added.

He was also concerned about the safety of his young child in London, after his high-profile position in government attracted threats. But he added that he never considered approaching a friend or neighbour in London for help with his child for fear of exposing them to a “deadly disease”.  And he said he was motivated in part by a desire to return to work in Downing Street and to ensure his family were safe if he did so.The senior aide denied making any stops on the journey from London to Durham. But he could only say he was “95 per cent sure” he had stopped off on the way home. He also admitted sitting near a river in Barnard Castle and that he and his wife had gone into some woods on the way back because his son needed to go to the toilet. Mr Cummings said his trip north had not been sanctioned by the prime minister. But he admitted that he had told Mr Johnson about it shortly afterwords, meaning the prime minster had been aware of the breach in the lockdown rules for weeks.       Asked later, Mr Johnson said he had “regrets” but only about the anger and confusion the public felt over his aide’s 500-mile round trip.

They are preparing them to support the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust in the battle against coronavirusMinistry of DefenceReutersNo 10 sources later suggested that Mr Cummings’s wife could not have driven the family home from Durham because she was not insured.  At least 15 Conservative MPs, including former ministers, have now called for Mr Cummings to go, while several others have spoken out against his behaviour. The prime minister is also coming under mounting pressure from his own MPs to order a Whitehall investigation into the case.  The local police and crime commissioner has also asked the chief constable of Durham police to establish the facts about Mr Cummings’s movements in Durham and whether he broke the law. Less than an hour before his statement the Tory MP for the area said she hoped reports he had taken a day trip in her constituency were untrue. Dehenna Davison, the MP for Bishop Auckland, said if the rules had been broken “appropriate action should be taken”.Earlier, a number of senior clergymen issued stinging criticism of Mr Johnson’s defence of his chief aide. The Right Reverend Paul Butler, bishop of Durham, said the public’s trust had been “broken”. The Right Reverend Nick Baines, bishop of Leeds, tweeted: “The question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs?”Meanwhile, the Faculty of Public Health, which represents public health professionals, said the government’s response to Mr Cummings’s actions had  “undermined essential public health messaging”. It added that it supported “at the very least an inquiry into the matter”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is no mixing and they aren’t touching each other,” Laurent David, the headteacher of the school near Nantes, tells The Independent. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They aren’t wearing masks, but they are following the orders very well, like using hand gel.” The students – aged between five and 11 years old – are experiencing school during the time of coronavirus. ​Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?As countries hit by coronavirus start making the first steps back towards normal life, children are returning to the classroom and parents back to work.In England, schools have been told to prepare for certain years to come back from 1 June, with the aim of all primary schools students returning for a month before the summer – a move which has faced criticism from unions and councils over safety concerns. Meanwhile in France, which has also been badly-affected by Covid-19, children were allowed back to school last week.Mr David says the Ecole elementaire la Metairie started teaching pupils aged five to 11 in school again on 12 May.“In the morning, we are bringing in around half of these children,” he says. “And during the afternoon, we are looking after the children who have stayed at home by doing distance teaching.”However, he says schools were under no obligation to open, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie asked parents for their opinion first.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSimilar to advice in England, schools have been told to limit class sizes to 15 children. This should be reduced to 10 for the youngest pupils in France. Although things have been going well, it gets much harder trying to get younger children to socially distance, Mr David explains. That is why lots of schools – including the preschool attached to his primary – have not yet brought children younger than five years old back into the classroom.He says other places have been bringing children back on alternate days, or even alternate weeks.“No school is working in the same way. The problem with making a six-year-old do a full day when they must stay at a table without moving around, is that becomes a very long day from them.”Mr David adds: “That makes teaching conditions very bad. Because of that, we decided to just open for mornings. It makes it easier, more effective for students, and more bearable.”However, he says it was difficult to balance the parents’ needs who were eager to return to work full time. He adds that schools have to follow health safety guidelines given to every headteacher, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie​ decided the best way they could open safely was to offer half days for now. Included in the guidelines is what to do if a child displays symptoms: call the parents straight away, and get them tested.Last Thursday, a child from the primary school near Nantes had to be taken home after falling ill and is waiting for their test results.“If it is really coronavirus, we may have to shut the school or send a class home,“We don’t have any problem doing that,” he adds.France allowed preschools and primary schools to reopen from the start of last week, with secondary schools allowed to gradually welcome students back from 18 May – although these older students must wear face masks. ‘I don’t know’: Minister admits schools reopening up in the airMinisters under pressure to scrap plans to open schools to more pupilsParents also have the right to keep their children at home if they wish.When asked what advice Mr David had for headteachers in England working to reopen schools next month, he says it is important to be “well-prepared”.“It took us two weeks to prepare properly,” he says, adding they were ready to open on the first day.“The most important thing is to make decisions as early as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The shock will come when that scheme ends, bringing a new wave of unemployment — predicted by some to be in double digits by the end of the year.As a result, the tax that we rely on to pay for essential public ­services such as the NHS, police, teachers and even MPs dwindles catastrophically.This will put a colossal strain on government funds. One result will be a reduction in finance for public services — and never-ending cuts.The gloomiest assessment of our future is that we don’t need to worry about whether restaurants will reopen, or fear airlines going bust, because we won’t be able to afford to eat out or holiday anywhere.We will be working hard to stand still, which is a rotten position to be in.At the moment, the Government is paying the wages of ten million ­people and giving them loans to survive. That was and is the right thing to do.But the cost to the public — ­estimated to be £BILLION this year — will be vast. And it’s growing all the time.Whichever way you look at it, with lockdown we have swallowed a very poisonous pill. In fact, it may go down in history as the greatest act of self-harm any civilisation has ever inflicted upon itself.Yes, it has saved some people, although not enough of the elderly living in care homes.But we have created a financial burden on the country that will last a generation. The economy is in freefall. It contracted . per cent in March, which is the biggest decline on record. Forget a recession — some say we face a depression.Usually this means higher public borrowing, higher taxes and an end to triple-lock pensions.Whatever happens, let’s just say that Boris Johnson’s election pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT for five years is on thin ice.Butthe Government tries to cover this exceptional cost from the current economy we will crash — and we will all be worse off.Rather than start taxing everyone to the hilt, I can see a better solution — with interest rates at rock bottom levels, theGovernment should borrow the money instead, becausetaxes rise too quickly it will halt growth. And growth in the economy is the single most important step to recovery.So we need to borrow, and spread the debt over a long period of  to  years, like the old wartime bonds, to cover the short-term shortfall. If we borrow over a long enough period we could actually increase spending in the short term to incentivise growth.Andwe bounce back, we can pay off our debt more quickly.We just need to get out of lockdown to get this process started.Shops and businesses must open up and start trading again. And we have to get the schools open.People cannot worktheir kids are not in school or in high-quality childcare.If trains and buses are too crowded for people to get to work, we have to find other ways to travel, or work from homewe can.But, perhaps most importantly, we have to accept that this virus is here and it’s not going away.We have to protect the most vulnerable, and those at risk should remain in lockdown for their own safety.The rest of us must take responsibility for ourselves. We need to keep social distance, wear facemasks, wash our hands and stay at homewe have symptoms. We must not take risks.But the quicker people get back to work, the more the recession can be moderated — and we all have a part to play in that.AS proposals go, the one by the man who set out five sausages like fingers on a plate, with his grandmother’s ring on the fourth one, could have been more romantic.Although he also wrote, “Will you marry me ” in HP Sauce on some toast.Presumably this man understands his girlfriend well enough to know what she likes.And when she stopped laughing, I’m guessing she probably said yes.After all, it’s the thought that counts.THIS week, something wonderful happened.It was announced that Captain Tom Moore will be awarded a knighthood after raising a remarkable £million for NHS charities.Cpt Tom, who just turned  and has been promoted to honorary colonel, said on Good Morning Britain he is “thrilled that Her Majesty has chosen poor little me to be knighted”, adding: “It really is a great honour and something I never ever anticipated.“It never, ever entered my head that something like that could happen to me.”But this genuinely could not be more well-deserved.With all the misery we have had to endure over the past few months, this is a little ray of sunshine.Bravo again, Sir Tom.DID anyone  get the giggles at this picture, right, of the Russian nurse wearing only her undies beneath a transparent protective gown Hospital chiefs were not amused and ­punished the nurse for “non- compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”.ONE of the many revelations of lockdown is what a dferent place the House of Commons is without most MPs being there in person.There are far fewer places for people to hide without the armies of grown men and women braying and shouting over each other.As a result, a new type of order is prevailing.The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, actually threatened to kick out Health Secretary Matt Hancock after he interrupted Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions.Hoyle treated Matt Hancock like a naughty schoolboy – which doesn’t feel right.But respect is earned and should be mutual.Perhaps one silver lining of lockdown will be a more respectful atmosphere in the Commons.I’VE been reflecting this week on what I’ve learned during the pandemic.Yes, I could share my theories here about human kindness and human idiocy, both of which have been on display in abundance over the past couple of months.Many of us have had time to think about what really matters and what doesn’t.We probably all have a mental list of things we most value from the “old” le, as well as silver linings and the benefits of the new way we have been living.But as we enter the ninth week of lockdownmy main conclusion, after a good deal of thought, is this: Women really do have superpowers.Most of the women I know are managing to . . . work from home, look after and home-school their children, cook and clean, shop for essentials, provide entertainment and keep up their family’s spirits, clap for carers and of course bake banana bread once a week.Now that’s what I call multi-tasking.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Iran, for example, has deployed a similar strategy.For years, we have known China censors what its people read and say online. Now we know authorities began censoring keywords and discussion of the outbreak weeks before its severity was acknowledged.Already in late December, doctors in Wuhan began to see patients suffering from an unusual pneumonia.Dr Li Wenliang,  who reported it to colleagues, was forced by police to sign a confession denouncing his communication as “illegal behaviour”.Dr Li later “died of the outbreak”.A number of critical journalists then went missing, along with Ren Zhiqiang, a well-known property tycoon critical of the regime.A month after his disappearance, China announced his official detention and investigation.Beijing is now saying that it will allow the WHO to visit for an investigation — but “not yet”.So how should we deal with China going forwards — especially since an inept, repressive officialdom has responded to international criticism with an aggressive misinformation campaign, completely misjudging the mood around the world China, as the world’s second-biggest economy, will remain an important export market for our goods and services.Even the Trump administration in the US does not want to close off a lucrative market for American farmers.It needs to abide by global rulesAs Trade Secretary, I tried to build a constructive relationship with my Chinese counterparts to help our businesses sell more to them and support jobs here.ButChina wants to be a partner in the global trading system, it needs to abide by global rules.This will be a major challenge as we face the inevitable task of reforming the World Trade Organization. When it comes to our national security, as The Sun on Sunday so clearly set out in recent weeks, we cannot afford to have it linked to other economic or political considerations.That is why I, along with a number of fellow MPs, voted against the Government’s plans to include Chinese tech firm Huawei in our G data network.China is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.That choice is in their hands. Our national security lies in ours.We all hope China will make the necessary reforms and take the right path.But hope is not a good basis for foreign policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He cannot stay.There has to be some contrition from Boris too or he will spend the next ten weeks having to answer questions about it all.“This is not a bubble story. Real people are furious, because they have been doing the right thing and isolating.”A second minister added: “The test is simple: Is retaining Cummings a sign of strength or weakness  It’s increasingly looking like the latter.”It came as:Last night protesters gathered at Mr Cummings’ London home.Campaigners Led By Donkeys sent a van with a video message slamming the aide and PM.Earlier cops dispersed crowds at .pm and knocked on the door, with no answer.Mr Cummings admits making a -mile trip to County Durham last month after we Mary fell ill with Covid- symptoms.But he furiously denies breaching the lockdown he helped mastermind — saying he made the trip over childcare concerns.He has refused to answer claims he was spotted  miles from Durham at Barnard Castle on April  — another apparent breach of the rules not to take unnecessary journeys.He denies claims he made a second trip to Durham on April , five days after ing to work in No . A couple insist they saw him admiring bluebells at a beauty spot.MPs accused Boris of hypocrisy, making the Government look arrogant and elitist, and seriously undermining the lockdown message.One grandee, who has been very supportive to now, told The Sun: “It’s Boris’s ‘Nothing has changed’ moment. My emails are exploding with rage.”A Tory MP in a northern constituency said colleagues there were fuming at No .They told The Sun: “We are f****** livid. We cannot understand why the PM didn’t launch an inquiry to get to the facts.”Another Tory added: “Are we putting Dom Cummings before the R rate  It looks like it.”Another said: “I can only think Boris is just dependent on him, like a battery in a Duracell bunny.“If we don’t sort this the public will turn against us in a big way.”Boris refused to sayhe knew about Mr Cummings’ -mile trip orhe had sanctioned it.He also refused to answer whether ordinary Brits could leave their main residence for wherethey had childcare concerns.The PM did hint that there were some special circumstances that influenced Mr Cummings’ decision, but “for medical reasons I don’t want to go into it”.But Stephen Reicher, a government adviser on behavioural science, blasted: “In a few short minutes Boris Johnson has trashed all advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures.”It was reported last night that Mr Cummings’ uncle Lord Justice Laws died from Covid- while the aide was in Durham.Mr Cummings’ mother Morag told the New Statesman: “We have been a grieving family, and there’s been no recognition of that.”Earlier Tory MP Steve Baker savaged Mr Cummings in an online article and TV interview.He fumed: “It is very clear that Dominic travelled when everybody  understood Dominic’s slogans to mean ‘Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives’.“And I think mums and dads who very much care about their children, and who have been forgoing the childcare of their extended family, will wonder why he has been allowed to do this.”Former minister Caroline Nokes warned there “cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others”.Sir Keir added: “This was a test of the Prime Minister and he has failed it. It is an insult to sacrices made by the British people.“The public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the Prime Minister’s closest adviser and another for the British people.”Last night The Sun was told just three Tory MPs were defending No on their backbench Whats-App group — out of -plus.They were ex-party leader Iain Duncan Smith, Sheryll Murray and Andrew Mitchell.The PM is due to announce further lockdown easing this week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has been proved right.“The problem with epidemiologists is that they feel their job is to frighten people into lockdown,” says Levitt. “I think lockdown saved no lives.”Indeed, this outbreak of ­coronavirus does not even rate officially as an epidemic.Just as many died in  from severe winter flu.

But he or his Chancellor must also now warn the nation directly about the horric consequencesBritain cannot rapidly be weaned off it.It is disturbing to see that the public, which dutully adopted these curbs to protect lives and the NHS, has grown addicted to them. Public sector workers reckon they are better off furloughed. Plenty in the private sector do too.Many parents, despite official scientic advice saying it is safe, say they will refuse totheir kids to school even though the PM has announced the first welcome reopenings on June  .Most people think the economy will right itself in a year or two and few seem bothered.They are more fixated on the furore over whether Dominic Cummings bent the lockdown rules to look after his child than with the looming catastrophe unless they are soon lted.This suicidal delusion is the result of a highly effective Government campaign about the Covid- threat, combined with generous bailouts, a promise of no new austerity and some great weather.Millions, including many Sun readers, have worked through the crisis. Millions more are itching to go back.Too many others, though, have been lulled into a disastrous  sense of security.We face an unprecedented recession. The economy has imploded.The Government had to borrow £billion in April, not far off half what Labour borrowed in a YEAR during the global financial crisis, leading to a decade of austerity.The initial trickle of job losses is already a flood and will soon be a tsunami.It falls to the PM or Rishi Sunak to explain to the nation in the starkest terms that unless we swtlyto near-normality, with public opinion onside, millions may never have a job toto. That this colossal new debt will take a generation to pay off.When the bailouts end and hardship bites, those who backed endless lockdown will not rue their own complacency. They will blame the Tories who failed to warn them how bad it would get.The Government also needs far more urgency over reopening shops, restaurants, pubs and travel — with social distancing — and a more realistic assessment of the tiny Covid risk to most people.The daily death toll, as heartbreaking as it still is, is falling fast. So are infections. The “R” rate, a virtually meaningless average distorted by care homes and hospitals, will be at or near zero in many places. One in  has the virus.Politicians and scientists are of course terried of causing new deaths. But over-caution could do so too, by impoverishing millions.

Secret meetings, coded messages, real cloak-and-dagger stuff.“A big part of the MI operation was sending secret items to troops in occupied territories.“Useful items like maps, compasses and even secret orders – anything to help them escape or evade capture.“Very often these items were ‘normal’ items that were sent in aid packages to camps, and the way items were secreted was very often ingenious.“It’s a unique collection, I’ve never seen another like it. These items are rare, really rare, near impossible to find, so to have an entire collection of them is certainly very special indeed.”The sale also includes two dominoes which, once pulled apart, reveal a small section of map. “These were likely sent as a full set,’ adds Andrew. He adds: “Once they had all been pulled apart, they would likely have a complete map of France to England, or similar.“German prison camp officials wouldn’t think twice that an innocent set of dominoes could do harm, but how wrong they were.“You can almost picture some RAF officers in their hut pulling apart these dominoes and planning their escape. It’s incredible stuff, both frightening and exhilarating at the same time.”The craftily concealed spy tools also include a box of matches which hide a secret compass in the base, a miniature spy camera, a miniature radio, and even a specially magnetised razor blade compass.Andrew said: “These items are very special. They highlight not only the ingenuity of the time, but also the desperation.“People successfully made it back to Britain because of these items.“These objects saved lives.

Yesterday I gave a full account to the Prime Minister of my actions between the th of March and the th of April, what I thought and did.He has asked me to repeat that account directly to you.I know that millions of people in this country are angry, thousands have died, many are angry about what they have seen in the media about my actions. I want to clear up the confusions and misunderstandings that I can.In retrospect I should have made the statement earlier. Its many years since I have said anything on television, but Ill do my best to answer questions after Ive explained what happened.I also should clary that Im not here to speak on behalf of the Government or the Prime Minister, Im explaining my own actions and my own thinking.The Prime Minister is giving a press conference later and he will answer questions on Government policy.Around midnight on Thursday, the th of March, I spoke to the prime minister. He told me that he tested positive for Covid. We discussed the national emergency arrangements for No., given his isolation and what I would do in No.  the next day.The next morning, I went to work as usual. I was in a succession of meetings about this emergency.I suddenly got a call from my we who was at home looking after our four year old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill. Shed vomited and felt like she might pass out. And therell be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available. They were alone in the house.After very briefly telling some officials in No. what had happened, I immediately left the building, ran to a car and drove home. This was reported by the media at the time who saw me run out of No. . After a couple of hours, my we felt a bit better. There were many critical things at work and she urged me toin the afternoon and I did.That evening, I ed home and discussed the situation with my we. She was ill. She might have Covid, though she did not have a cough or a fever. At this point, most of those who I work with most closely, including the prime minister himself and others who sit within  feet of me every day, either had had symptoms and had ed to work or were absent with symptoms. I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease.I had a few conflicting thoughts in my mind. First, I was worried thatmy we and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London that we could reasonably ask to look after our child and exposed themselves to Covid. My we had felt on the edge of not being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier. I was thinking, whatthe same or worse happens to me  Theres nobody here that I can reasonably ask to help. The regulations make clear, I believe the risks to the health of a small child were an exceptional situation, and I had a way of dealing with this that minimised risk to others.Second, I thought thatI did not develop symptoms, then I might be able toto work to help deal with the crisis. There were ongoing discussions about testing government staff in order to keep people like me working rather than isolating. At this point, on the Friday, advisers such as myself had not been included in the list of who were tested. But it was possible that this might change the following week. Therefore, I thought that after testing negative, I could continue working.In fact, this did not change and special advisers were not tested and I have never been tested. Third, there had been numerous  stories in the media about my actions and statements regarding Covid. In particular, there were stories suggesting that I had opposed lockdown and even then I did not care about many deaths. For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning. The truth is, that I had argued for lockdown. I did not oppose it. But these stories had created a very bad atmosphere around my home. I was subject to threats of violence. People came to my house shouting threats.There were posts on social media, encouraging attacks. There were many media reports on TV showing pictures of my house. I was also worried that given the severity of this emergency, this situation would get worse. And I was worried about the possibility of leaving my we and child at home all day and off into the night while I worked in No.. I thought the best thing to do in all the circumstances was to drive to an isolated cottage on my fathers farm. At this farm, my parents live in one house.My sister and her two children live in another house, and there was a separate cottage roughly  metres away from either of them. My tentative conclusion on the Friday evening was this:we are both unable to look after our child, then my sister or nieces can look after him. My nieces are  and . They are old enough to look after him, but also young enough to be in the safest category. And they had extremely kindly volunteered to do soneeded.But, I thought,I do not develop symptoms and there is a testing regime in place at work, I couldto workI tested negative. In that situation, I could leave my we and child behind in a safe place, safe in the form of support from family for shopping in emergencies, safe in the sense of being away from home which had become a target and also safe for everybody  because they were completely isolated on a farm and could not infect anybody.Contrary to some media reports, there are no neighbours in the normal sense of the word. The nearest other homes are roughly half a mile away. So in this scenario, I thought that they could stay there for a few weeks. I could go back to work, help colleagues and everybody, including the general public, would be safe.I did not ask the prime minister about this decision. He was ill himself and he had huge problems to deal with. Everyday, I have to exercise my judgement about things like this and decide what to discuss with him. I thought I would speak to him when the situation claried over coming days, including whether I had symptoms and whether there were tests available.Arguably, this was a mistake, and I understand that some will say that I shouldve spoken to the prime minister before deciding what to do. So I drove the three of us up to Durham last night, arriving roughly at midnight. I did not stop on the way. When I worked the next morning, Saturday the th of March, I was in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever.Clearly, I could notto work any time soon. For a day or two, we were both ill. I was in bed. My we was ill, but not ill enough that she needed emergency help. I got worse. She got better. During the night of Thursday, the nd of April, my child woke up. He threw up and had a bad fever. He was very distressed. We took medical advice which was to call . An ambulance was sent, they assessed my child and said he must go to hospital.I could barely stand up. My we went with him in the ambulance. I stayed at home. He stayed the night in the hospital. In the morning, my we called to say that he had recovered, seemed back to normal. Doctors had tested him for Covid and said that they shouldhome. There were no taxis. I drove to the hospital, picked them up, then ed home.I did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody at any point on this short trip. The hospitals, I dont know what, roughly five miles or something away two miles, three miles four miles, something like that. A few days later, the hospital said that he tested negative. After I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house.At one point the three of us walked into woods owned by my father, next to the cottage that I was staying in. Some people saw us in these woods from a distance, but we had no interaction with them. We had not left the property. We were on private land. By Saturday, the th of April, I was still feeling weak and exhausted. But other than that, I had no Covid symptoms. I thought that Id be able toto work the following week, possibly part time.It was obvious that the situation was extremely serious. The Prime Minister had been gravely ill. Colleagues were dealing with huge problems and many were ill or isolating. I felt like I ought toto workpossible, given I was now recovering in order to relieve the intense strain at No. . That Saturday, I sought expert medical advice. I explained our familys symptoms and all the timings, and I askedit was safe toto work on Monday, Tuesday, seek child care and so on. I was told that it was safe and I couldto work and seek childcare.On Sunday  April,  days after I had first displayed symptoms, I decided toto work. My we was very worried, particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease. She didnt want to risk a nearly -mile drive with our child, given how ill I had been. We agreed that we should go for a short drive to seeI could drive safely. We drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town.We did not visit the castle. We did not walk around the town. We parked by a river. My we and I discussed the situation. We agreed that I could drive safely, we should turn around, go home. I felt a bit sick. We walked about  to  metres from the car to the river bank nearby. We sat there for about  minutes. We had no interactions with anybody. I felt better. We ed the car. An elderly gentleman walking nearby appeared to recognise me. My we wished him Happy Easter from a distance, but we had no other interaction.We headed home. On the way home, our child needed the toilet. He was in the back seat of the car. We pulled over to the side of the road, my we and child jumped out into the woods by the side of the road. They were briefly outside. I briefly joined them. They played for a little bit and then I got out of the car, went outside. We were briefly in the woods. We saw some people at a distance. But at no point did we break any social distancing rules. We then got back in the car and went home.We agreed thatI continued to improve then the next day, we shouldto London and I would go back to work. We ed to London on the evening of Monday  April, Easter Monday. I went back to work in No.  the next morning. At no point between arriving and leaving Durham did any of the three of us enter my parents house or my sisters house. Our only exchanges were shouted conversations at a distance. My sister shopped for us and left everything outside.In the last few days, there have been many media reports that I ed to Durham after  April. All these stories are . There is a particular report that I ed there on  April. Photos and data on my phone prove this to be . And local CCTV,it exists, would also prove that Im telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.During this two-week period, my mothers brother died with Covid. There are media reports that this had some influence on my behaviour. These reports . This private matter did not affect my movements. None of us saw him. None of us attended his funeral. In this very complex situation, I tried to exercise my judgement the best I could.I believe that in all circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in No. and the public interest in effective government to which I could contribute.I was involved in decisions affecting millions of people, and I thought that I should try to help as much as I could do. I can understand that some people will argue that I should have stayed at my home in London throughout.I understand these views. I know the intense hardship and sacrice that the entire country has had to go through. However, I respectfully disagree. The legal rules inevitably do not cover all circumstances, including those that I found myself in. I thought and I think today that the rules, including those regarding small children in extreme circumstances, allowed me to exercise my judgement about the situation I found myself in, including the way that my London home had become a target and all the complexity of the situation.I accept, of course, that there is room for reasonable disagreement about this. I could also understand some people think I should not have driven at all anywhere.But I had taken medical expert medical advice. It was  days after symptoms. Id been told that I couldto work and employ childcare. I think it was reasonable and sensible to make a short journey before embarking on a five-hour drive to see whether I was in a fit state to do this. The alternative was to stay in Durham rather than going back to work and contributing to the governments efforts. I believe I made the right judgment, though I can understand that others may disagree with that.Ive explained all of the above to the Prime Minister. At some point during the first week where we were both sick and in bed, I mentioned to him what I had done. Unsurprisingly, given the condition we were in, neither of us remember the conversation in any detail. I did not make my movements public at the time because my London home was already a target. I did not believe that I was obliged to make my parents and my sisters home a target for harassment as well.I understand that millions of people have seen media coverage of this issue. I know that millions have endured awful hardship, including personal tragedies, over the past few months, and people are suffering every day.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After pressure from animal rights activists, the Dutch government banned new mink farms in  and said existing ones would have to close by .Animal rights campaigners from PETA Netherlands dressed in protective suits to urge Carola Schouten to bring forward the ban. The group claimed: Dirty fur farms full of sick, stressed and injured minks are breeding grounds for diseases.Mink are not the only animals to have contracted the killer bug.Big cats at the Bronx Zoo in New York City came down with coronavirus in April.The animals were tested after a four-year-old Malayan tiger called Nadia started coughing last month and was later confirmed to have been struck down.But there has been a lot of confusion over whether pets can catch or carry coronavirus.During the early stages of the outbreak, scientists and government officials initially confirmed that it wasnt possible.However, several dogs and a cat tested positive for Covid- following close contact with infected humans, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health.On April , the World Organisation for Animal Health said: Now that Covid- virus infections are widely distributed in the human population there is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on. He really is a total dingwad.Progress, people.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month.

You’re helping to tackle loneliness and isolation. You’re providing meals to people that cannot leave home. You’re helping fund projects that support physical and mental health in communities across the entire nation.We’re facing exceptional times brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.But thanks to you, £ million of funding from The National Lottery is being distributed over the next few months to charities, projects and good causes. This vital funding has helped hundreds of key projects continue to offer support to people in our communities.  One of those to benefit is Northern Ireland’s Macular Society, which helps people struggling with their sight due to macular degeneration. They provide peer support, counselling, help, advice and many other services to members. The charity received an additional £, grant from The National Lottery to adapt and increase support for people remotely during lockdown. Elaine Orwinhas been involved with the charity for  years. The -year-old said: Macular disease affects your physical health. You often can’t drive so lose your independence, but our group of  members is a leline. We used to meet monthly, but since lockdown it’s fortnightly virtual meetings, and I’ve also referred people for phone counselling. The contact we have had is really precious.  The charity is planning to launch a befriending service and webinars, and they’ve also run a Tech Talk project, helping members to use computers and even just access audio description on their TVs. It’s really important for us to thank National Lottery players, as without them none of this would be possible. Another project to receive funding is Leicester’s Emerald Centre, which supports vulnerable people of all ages, including elderly residents and those with disabilities, in a deprived area of the city.  Chris Murphy , , who lives alone, says the charity has kept him in touch with friends during this dficult time. He explained: The centre has been bringing me a food parcel every week. They stop for a chat when it’s delivered and phone to check I’m okay. I love working in my garden so they’ve sent me bits for that, and there’s also been activity packs and books I’ve borrowed from them. It’s all keeping me busy! It’s great that people are playing The National Lottery and helping us. Merthyr Tydfil’s Twyn Community Hubhas also received support, with a £, grant from The National Lottery to expand their daily hot meals and weekly hamper project during lockdown. The charity helps families and vulnerable, older people, with everything from weekly food parcels to organising bingo nights and quizzes.  Jean Jonesis someone who benefits regularly from their work. The -year-old said: I’ve been going to events including bingo at Twyn Community Hub since moving here nearly six years ago, and throughout lockdown staff and volunteers have been popping round most days to deliver food, and have a chat. I’m lucky in that I phone friends and family, but other older people in the area would see no one otherwise. The meals and food they provide are fabulous. Being able to take away the worry about small, practical, everyday things is so important. Thanks to people playing The National Lottery that is happening right here in our local area. Itaposs thanks to National Lottery players, as well as the people who run these vital services, that these sorts of charities and local projects have been able to continue offering support to the most vulnerable people in our communities.

So thanks to Downing Street for taking me back to my childhood and putting on Carry On Bullsh*tting. That sketch about testing your eyes for a long drive by going for a longish one with your four-year-old in the car was cracking. But the longer this excruciating exhibition of detachedness from reality went on, the less funny it was. The interview was a Prince Andrew-style car crash. And the sight of Cummings sucking in all the political oxygen due to breaking lockdown rules we had all been sticking to, on a day when we were waiting to hear from the Prime Minister when we could start to dismantle them, was a national disgrace. His contempt for the Little People was evident from the off when he turned up more than half an hour late. It continued when he kept answering questions by saying “with great respect” when his face was sneering at the reporter he was supposedly respecting. The haughty disdain continued when he read out what sounded like an Enid Blyton story called Three Go For A Pee In The Woods. It read like a litany of excuses we’ve all heard given in school as teachers howled in disbelief.  Any moment I expected him to say he only drove to Durham because the cat peed on his satnav. It was a tale in which he admitted multiple breaches of rules he helped draw up but he could not possibly apologise because it was all the media’s fault. Throughout, I was recalling the many times Tony Blair’s senior adviser, Alastair Campbell, and Gordon Brown’s, Charlie Whelan, had said to me that once you become the story you have to go.

In a highly unusual press conference in the rose garden of  Downing Street, the Prime Ministeraposs chief adviser said he made the journey because of fears over a lack of childcarehe became incapacitated with the virus, and concerns about his familyaposs safety. Mr Cummings said he was worried thatboth he and his we fell ill, there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid. Body language expert Judi James has studied the footage of Cummingsapos unusual statement and QA. There had been debate about how the man often seen as the Maverick of Downing Street and a guy who doesn’t suffer fools gladly might decide how to perform his message today in the wake of his boss Boris’s ‘making a bad situation worse’ press statement of the day before. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here The Cummings we saw appeared very much to play against type. Almost humble in his arrival he sat at a table wearing a bland white shirt rather than his signature Islington grunge and his weak, soft-sounding voice as he apologized for being late plus the way he then sat shuffling and arranging his notes across his table for a considerableof time suggested a man beset by nerves. He leaned forward on his elbows to self-diminish his frame in what looked like a non-confrontational and even modest approach. He scratched his arm, he licked at his lips and he read word-from-word from his script as he told his tale in detail. His knee-splay suggested some of his boss’s love of machismo but his feet were crossed at the ankle, hinting at some repression of anything resembling arrogance or confrontation. His eyes were either on his notes or they were darting as he picked at his pen and the way he picked his papers up and banged them hard on the table suggested he was keen to be off, as did his left leg which appeared to be making an early break for the exit at one point. His stuttering as he answered questions did suggest some struggles under pressure but verbally he stuck stubbornly to a line of ‘no regrets’.

The National Pharmacy Association has written to Boris Johnson asking for help as its members face an unprecedented crisis triggered by the outbreak.The sector was handed a £million advanced payment to cope with Covid-, with £million paid on April  and £million at the start of this month. But announcing the cash, the Department of Health stressed the cash was not extra money. It said: “This uplt is not an additional funding over and above what was agreed for   under the Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework -year deal.

The £ bill works out at £. a day – just p more than a large Big Mac meal in McDonald’s. The bargain end-terrace property has been listed to let in the proud former mining village of Horden, Co Durham. Experts believe it is the cheapest family home to rent in the UK for many years. The “spacious” double-glazed property, just a short stroll from a beach and near two schools, features two double bedrooms, fitted bathroom and two reception rooms. The s home is a whopping  per cent cheaper than the average £,-a-month cost of a two-bed property in London’s exclusive Mayfair. But some locals issued a warning to would-be tenants that certain streets in the village were plagued with Asbo yobs. Former primary school teacher Doug Langan, , said: “There is a lot to like about Horden. There’s a great community spirit and it’s right on the coast.” But he added of the area where the house stands: “Some of the houses are owned by retired miners who have been there  years but others have gone to rack and ruin. £ is cheap but you will get what you pay for.” Fth Street, just  yards from Durham’s Heritage Coast, has proved a hit with ­families searching for a budget base. The low-cost let could even be popular with commuters in larger towns able to work from home and looking to save a fortune. Graeme Wetherell, , who moved to Horden aged ten, said: “Strangers from other parts of the country have moved here because it is so cheap.

Pictures from Kent showed Botany Bay and Margate Main Sands rammed with beach goers. Residents complained of a aposstrong smell of urineapos due to a lack of facilities at those locations, Kent Live reported.

Anthony Igoe was hospitalised with a serious lung infection but medics in the south-east Asian country have told him he must pay for the antibiotics himself. The -year-oldaposs family, from Clydebank, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, are scrambling to raise the cash or doctors will simply remove the infected lung. Girlfriend Alana Fonseca, , who has been by Anthony’s bedside since he fell ill has pleaded with anyone who can to please help us - with her partner too sick to fly home.She told the Daily Record : “If I could, I would have brought him home to Scotland but he is not allowed to fly.We have literally been told the doctors at the public hospital will have to remove Anthony’s lung because the drugs he needs are too expensivewe can’t pay for them.” Dad Jerry, , meanwhile, is lost for words and suffering sleepless nights thinking about his sonaposs ordeal. “My guts are in knots, he admitted. I wake up in the middle of the night and it feels asI have been eating a ton of ice. “I have no real words to say how it feels to have a son in hospital and be unable to get to him. Jerry added Anthonyaposs sister Andrea is in Australia and is doing what she can from there to help too”, before echoing Alanaaposs plea in begging Brits to please help as much as you can.  Anthony picked up two bacterial infections in Cambodia. His insurance firm, Cigna, are refusing to pay for his treatment because they say he was already suffering from the lung condition when he took out a policy in February. The first indication Anthony was ill was in January when he started coughing and getting chest pains. He was given antibiotics by doctors in Cambodia. In March, Anthony began to feel poorly again – and his health has gone downhill due to the lung ­infection. Alana said: “He was warm to the touch and one day in school he lay down on the floor and said, ‘I can’t do this.’ It was the first indication he was so sick. “He just got worse and his fever wasn’t going away. The last week in April he was really bad. He had lost  kilos in a month.” Alana took him to hospital where he was taken to intensive care. She said: “This is when we realised things were really bad. I feel so guilty I didn’t get him to hospital before.” After tests, it was found he’d picked up two bacteria. One has led to an abscess in his lung – causing permanent damage – while the other led to pneumonia. Alana added: “He needs to be in hospital for at least another week on very strong intravenous ­antibiotics and then he will need between eight months of strong oral antibiotics as well as X-rays.

However the company that runs the van said they followed all the rules and that when officers tuned up they had aposno problemapos with the measures they had taken to comply with regulations. This is yet to be confirmed by police.  Another witness, who was walking in the area at the time, said he couldnapost’ believe what he was seeing.Speaking to North Wales Live, said: “I was going for a walk through Cibyn at about .pm, and I saw a load of cars queuing and people walking in groups.“As I turned the corner, I could see the queue went all the way down the road and back up again. “There was a long queue of people on foot as well. There was social distancing towards the end of the queue, but the closer people were to the van, the closer they were together.  “I thought they must have been giving them out for free judging by the amount of people there, but I heard people were paying for them. I honestly couldn’t believe that people were doing this. It was really surreal. I can’t get my head around it. “I’m annoyed more than anything that people would do it. “It shouldn’t have been there. It’s encouraging non-essential travel.”  North Wales Events and Catering Services, who run the Tango Ice Blast van, said they acted within the rules and chose the estate because it is “out of town” and “less likely” to attract walkers. The Welsh Government has advised people to stay home and only travel when absolutely necessary.One person wrote on Facebook : “What a thing to do when we are in lockdown encouraging people to go out for non-essential reasons, appalling.”Another called it a disgrace” and said: “No wonder the numbers of covid in Gwynedd is not coming down.

We have the highest cases in North Wales and all these queuing for a slush, it’s totally wrong.” North Wales Events and Catering Services said: “Many food outlets are reopening now with measures put in place to work in a safe manner not only for the employees but also for the customers. “From experiencewe work in the centre of a town this can create a number of walking customers. Thataposs why we used the Cibyn Industrial Estate, out of the town centre and less likely to attract lots of walk-ins “However those that do walk to the site are reminded of our m distance constantly by our staff who attempt to marshal the queues to the best of our ability and we have measures put in place to ensure there is a m gap.

Scientists behind Boots’ own label No  Advanced Retinol .% Complex Night Concentrate claim it hits the “sweet spot” to reduce lines and give older skin “bounce”. The lotion uses retinol, which is said to increase cell renewal encouraging new skin to form. But skin experts say while known for skin-boosting properties, it can cause irritation. Jemma McBride of leading brand Kiehl’s said: “Retinol - or Vitamin A - is a potent ingredient that must be used with caution as it [can] aggravate the skin.”  Website  skinregimen  added: “Because retinol is such a powerful ingredient, it’s best to start out by using it twice a week, before building up to everyday use and stronger formulations.”But the Boots team claim their latest formula has overcome potential problems and “delivers maximum results with minimal irritation”. It reckons users will notice “results after one night”. The chain’s head of science research Dr Mike Bell worked with a team from Manchester University to perfect the formula thathas seen unprecedented demand before hitting shelves. Dr Bell insisted: “This is set to be a game-changer for millions of women who want to transform the appearance of their skin.”The same team created Boots’ No  Protect  Perfect Serum which sold out within minutes in  after being featured on the BBC’s Horizon programme.

The upcoming series is set to delve deep into the shadowy world inhabited by the disgraced financier. Epstein committed suicide in his prison cell last August, aged , while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Netflix has released the official trailer for the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich which will land online on Wednesday. Ahead of its release, his accusers and investigators have described his apostrade.apos  The series will feature first-person accounts from his accusers and investigates failings in the US justice system that allowed him to continue preying on women. According to the streaming giant, the four-part series will chart how Epstein ran aposan international sex trafficking ring.apos It will also accuses him of aposabusing women and underage girls for decadesapos, according to Netflix. A series of voiceovers from interviewees who took part in the documentary describe Epstein and his aposever-revolving door of girlsapos in the preview. One describes him as a aposGatsby-like figure,apos referring to the enigmatic millionaire titular character in F. Scott Fitzgeraldaposs  novel, The Great Gatsby.  Victim Haley Robsonaposs voice can be heard in the trailer for the four-part documentary series which begins streaming on Wednesday. “These girls brought other girls too,” she says. Ms Robson told the documentaryaposs filmmakers that she had initially rejected Epstein’s advances — but wound up recruiting girls for him at a price of  each . She will reportedly allege in the documentary that she recruited  underage girls, mostly friends and classmates, to Epstein’s home. In the trailer she can be heard saying: “It’s a trade. And it goes on and on and on. Attorney Brad Edwards is also slated to speak in the documentary.  The lawyer representing victim Courtney Wild, whom he met after the FBI started investigating Epstein, will claim his team put together a flow chart of victims - only to realise it could end up being five times as big as the poster board it was on. We had to prove that this pyramid of underage girls in Palm Beach was true, Mr Edwards said according to the newspaper. It didnapost start from just a random underage girl walking into the house. Netflix has said the documentary will follow how Epstein preyed on girls, allegedly with the assistance of his friend, Ghislaine Maxwell. The trailer features footage surveying the aposso-called Paedophile Island,apos where Epstein accused of ferrying young women to entertain himself and his guests. Epstein apossex slaveapos Virginia Giuffre also makes a cameo in the trailer.

Those with green fingers can spend hours and hours each week checking on the condition of the leaves and state of the soil to ensure their crop is keeping healthy and happy.One such woman who had spent months watering and feeding a plant in her garden reaped the rewards of her hard work, watching it flourish, as reported by the Daily Star.Having taken the plant under her wing, she decided to do some more research to identy exactly what the species was and how best to care for it.But her quest quickly produced an unexpected result - and she shared the findings to a Facebook group to give other gardeners aposa good laughapos.Thataposs because it turned out the plant she had been lovingly caring for over a number of months was in fact a weed.

The discovery of the galaxy, as it existed  billion years ago, will forever change theories on how the earliest formation of the universeaposs structures evolved. Named R, the galaxy is  billion light-years from the Solar System and makes stars  times the rate of the Milky Way. The hole is two billion times longer than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. It is a collisional ring galaxy, making it the first one ever located in the early Universe. While the more common type of galaxy forms because of internal processes, collisional ones form as a result of immense and violent encounters with other galaxies. Astronomers say they are extremely rare, with one collisional galaxy for every  usual ones. Dr Tiantian Yuan, from Australiaaposs ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in  Dimensions , said: It is a very curious object that weaposve never seen before. It looks strange and familiar at the same time. It is making stars at a rate  times greater than the Milky Way. Most of that activity is taking place on its ring - so it truly is a ring of fire. Using images recorded by NASAaposs Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopic data gathered by the WM Keck Observatory in Hawaii, Dr Yuan was able to identy the unusual structure.  Dr Ahmed Elagali, based at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Western Australia, said studying R would help determine when spiral galaxies began to develop. He said: Further, constraining the number density of ring galaxies through cosmic time can also be used to put constraints on the assembly and evolution of local-like galaxy groups. Professor Kenneth Freeman from the Australian National University said the discovery had implications for understanding how galaxies like the Milky Way formed. He said: The collisional formation of ring galaxies requires a thin disk to be present in the aposvictimapos galaxy before the collision occurs, he explained. The thin disk is the defining component of spiral galaxies: before it assembled, the galaxies were in a disorderly state, not yet recognisable as spiral galaxies. In the case of this ring galaxy, we are looking back into the early universe by  billion years, into a time when thin disks were only just assembling.

It was great.“I remember being in Dens and just crossing the street and after one minute we were at the Dundee United stadium. That was the most strange thing.“I have played in a lot of derbies, Boca Juniors-River Plate, after that Rangers-Celtic, I played against Lazio when I was at Roma so I can say I have played great games with two teams who hate each other. It was great for the people.“I knew the fans would feel it a lot to win against United. I know the feeling of winning a derby.“With my team-mates we celebrated with the fans and it was great. I had won derbies in my career and that was another one – I wanted to win that game because I knew how signicant it is for the fans.”He added: “It was a great experience, one I liked a lot and I’m not just saying that. I liked my time a lot in Scotland.“I didn’t know anything about Dundee when Bonetti called me but I said ‘let’s go and don’t think about that’. The people were great.“I remember the first game against Aberdeen, coming on in the second half. I was kicked by a defender who got a red card – I had to jump otherwise he would have broken my legs!“I liked the way of playing football in Scotland, I liked the dynamic of the game.“You could never say you had won a gameyou were winning - with five minutes to go. In Italy, you are winning - or - and no one wants to go forward so I liked that a lot.”Caniggia’s ability and manner on the pitch quickly endeared him to the Dundee support with many sporting long, blonde wigs as a tribute.“I remember the guys with the wigs, it was very funny. I like the people in Scotland a lot, very funny, easy going people and with a lot of pride.“Dens was a small stadium but I liked it a lot and the people at the club were great.“We had good players. I remember Gavin Rae, Barry Smith, Georgi Nemsadze – we had a few good players. We could match the big teams.”At the end of the first season, however, Caniggia would move on to Rangers as he chased a place at the  World Cup.Caniggia explained: “I was already -years-old but I was very fit.

I felt a part of it right away.“That helped me settle in and the football takes care of itself.”Outwith title glory, one of the best moments for Shanks was scoring twice against top-flight Hibs in their Scottish Cup fourth-round tie.United were dumped out after a replay but Shankland believes they can take the positives into the Premiership next season as the Tangerines set their sights on a top-six finish.He continued: “It was an exciting tie for us – everyone was looking at it as probably one of the biggest of the round and it was, obviously, televised and they brought a big crowd up with them as well.“It had a bit of a derby feel to it because the crowd was so good.“At home we more than matched them and earned the replay.“At times, we probably were a wee bit under the cosh and rode our luck a wee bit.“In those games you need to. When we went down to Easter Road and it went to - it could’ve gone either way.“It was just important bigDoidge took all his chances that night.“There’s nothing much you can doa striker’s on form and he takes them all.“It showed us as players we have the ability to match teams like that.“Hibs have got real good quality through their team, they’re all good footballers and comfortable on the ball.“That’s something we need to take up to next season, to be confident in going to places like that and playing.“I felt we can take the positives out of it.”It wasn’t all plain sailing in his first season with the Terrors but Shankland believes their recovery from consecutive defeats to Alloa and Queen of the South showed their mettle.Lting the lid on their post-match debrief in Dumfries, he explained: “It wasn’t the gaffer after the Queen of the South game, it was the players.“We knew that performance wasn’t acceptable, obviously.“Alloa was a tighter game where we could’ve maybe got something from it, albeit we didn’t play well at all.“But when we went down to Queen of the South we got absolutely battered.“We were second to every ball that bounced and we just knew ourselves we were nowhere near good enough.“The boys after the game had a conversation and we put our dferences aside over how we all felt.“I felt it really helped at the time because you don’t want to get caught up in bad runs.“It was two or three games on the bounce but we knew they were hard places to go.“We knew other teams would struggle there and it wouldn’t be just us but the performance at Queen of the South, for me personally, I felt I let down myself.“I knew how bad I’d played and my team-mates were the same.“That was the main thing – everybody looked at themselves and we discussed what we could improve on.“That’s what we did and I felt it worked.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

Aberdeen City Council, Creative Scotland and the University of Aberdeen we’re delighted to be giving pupils in the city an opportunity to get creative and to put their skills to the test.“It is also a vehicle to document this unprecedented period through the eyes of our young people – I know there will be very powerful pieces of work and, even in such dficult times, a chance to take a lighter look at what is such an unusual way of le for us all.”Winners will be treated to a visit to NESCol’s film and television facilities when College buildings reopen.With studios and the latest production equipment, the College caters for a broad range of courses ranging from media analysis and production, TV and digital media to filmcraft and animation.Sara added: “The creative industries always

schools up and running","story":"All children will have the opportunity toto school in some form after lockdown, a north-east education chief has revealed.The Covid- crisis threw schools into chaos earlier this year, with pupils and staff forced to adapt to learning and teaching from home.However, last week the Scottish Government announced its aim of pupils ing to the classroom from August,it is safe to do so.And now Aberdeenshire Council#s director of education and children#s services, Laurence Findlay, has set out how the local authority plans to get youngsters back to school.He admitted the council is facing challenges in ensuring social distancing is maintained, and revealed a raft of new measures are being considered.These include taping off desks, installing one-way systems and incorporating hygiene-based activities into the school day.Pupils# start, finish and break times could also be staggered, and a #blended# learning model introduced # meaning they study at school for part of the time and learn from home for the remainder.Mr Findlay said: “The picture is starting to emerge. We’re aware we will potentially be able to let teachers back into schools at some point in Junethe scientic and medical advice says it’s safe.“From August, we can then start bringing groups of learners back. It won’t be a normal school experience as people remember it from before. There will be small groups coming in, social distancing, extra hygiene, health and safety measures. It will be very much a blended approach to learning and we will also still be providing childcare for the children of key workers.“We are not going back to the way things were on March  but the roadmap sets out a very clear direction, providing the medical and scientic advice says it’s safe to do so. Our planning for that has already started and we will be working closely with head teachers, staff and trade union colleagues – teaching and non-teaching – over the coming weeks. We are aiming for some kind of approved provision from August.“We are considering a range of measures to put in place, for example there could be staggered start and finish times and staggered lunch times to minimise the number of people circulating at any one time. We will look at putting one-way systems in place in our larger schools so there’s less congestion in the corridors. In inidual classrooms we will remove furniture where we have space to store it, and where we haven’t we will tape off every other table.“There will be clear signage and markings in place and we will have hand-washing and hygiene activities built into the school day. We will continue to communicate with young people and parents about the importance of social distancing.“For those who have specic additional support needs, we will ensure appropriate risk assessments are carried out. We will do everything we can to use all the facilities we have to promote social distancing and make sure that remains firmly in place.#However, Mr Findlay admitted a single policy will not suit every school in the region # so council staff are working around the clock to come up with inidual plans for each one.He said: “We have got over  schools in Aberdeenshire – some are very large and some are very small. Some have closed classrooms, some are open-plan and some are a mixture of the two so there won’t be a one-size-fits-all approach. There will have to be bespoke plans for every school and we will work with our head teachers to do that, based on the type of school, the school roll and the availability of staff what configuration would be best.“At some schools, it may be whole days and in some it may be half. It may be based on rotas over a fortnight. All that will be worked out over the next couple of months as we head towards summer and as we get more and more accurate advice and data from government.“In some schools, it will be quite easy to have a lot of children in at the same time but in larger schools it will be done very much by year group. We will also do what we can, although we can’t guarantee it, to keep family groups together because that makes it easier in terms of transportation and the notion of a social bubble. These are things which are being actively planned just now.“We want to ensure a blended approach for all children so they all get an experience of being back in school.#Given the rurality of much of Aberdeenshire, Mr Findlay highlighted transport to and from school as being a potential problem # and the council is expecting guidance on how to get pupils there and home again.He said: #Transport will be a signicant issue for us given our rurality and the size of Aberdeenshire.“We are expecting further advice and guidance this week on school transport so we will wait and see what that says and then bring our transport colleagues at the council into the planning to see what we can offer.#The Scottish Government#s restart date also threw up a potential issue for the council as schools across the north-east were scheduled tofrom the summer holidays on August .That could have created a headache with staff having to forgo a week of their break # but Mr Findlay insisted they will be repaid.He said: “We have been told we will get advice from the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, which oversees their terms and conditions. They are going to provide advice on when that extra week should be taken.#That will be given to the Local Negotiating Committee for Teachers, and we will work on the advice we are given to ensure that week is given back at some point through the school year.”Since the UK went into lockdown at the end of March, staff have been working tirelessly to implement distance and digital learning for pupils to make sure they do not miss out on their education.They have also staffed childcare set up for the children of key workers, at which attendance figures have risen by a third during the lockdown period.And Mr Findlay paid tribute to the teachers, assistants and council workers for their efforts in keeping the education system running.He said: “It’s fair to say it’s been a busy few weeks and we have barely stopped.“There have been ious aspects to it. We have had our home learning online which has gone really well.“Teachers have been providing material online and then checking in on learners to see the progress they are making. They have also been supporting parents as much as they can to help learning at home.“That has been one big part of our work. Another part has been around childcare hubs. We have set up  hubs across Aberdeenshire – one in each locality for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.“That’s gone well. We started off with quite a low turnout of about  children a day but we are now up to more than  attending so that has been positive. We have also been providing free school lunches by direct payments to parents on a monthly basis which has been going well too.“A lot of work was required in a short period of time to get these things set up but it has been going well.“We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all the staff across Aberdeenshire because they have really stepped up to the plate. They have put in a lot of hours and showed great creativity, agility and imagination to adapt to their new way of working.#He added: “It’s amazing that in  weeks we have made all this happen. Some of the stuff around digital and remote learning has been talked about for years and there’s been some with mixed success, but when a crisis has come along people have stepped up and made it happen very quickly so we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.“Teams of staff have been working round the clock to get things ready at home, in the schools and childcare hubs and also centrally. People have been putting in the hours to make this work.#The Aberdeenshire branch of teachers# union the EIS revealed it has set out requirements to be met before it can be deemed safe to reopen.It says there must be evidence of capacity to test, trace and isolate on a national level, while measures must be introduced to ensure social distancing, hygiene measures and continuing risk-assessment.And it called for transparent and shared evidence that the spread of the infection is under control and that schools are safe workspaces.Aberdeenshire branch secretary David Smith said: #Any proposed measures in Aberdeenshire will be subject to those red lines but to date, there has been open and transparent dialogue with ourselves via the LNCT forum on a regular basis on the above and in relation to blended learning, which will require continuing dialogue around how this will look and resourced in terms of staffing, as our members cannot be teaching full time and providing home learning activities.#We await further national guidance on this issue to facilitate further positive local discussion, which has always been a feature of how we conduct business in Aberdeenshire. Such discussions are likely to increase in frequency over the coming days reflecting the level of activity around these issues currently.#The EIS will continue to provide advice for members and also intend to issue training modules for our school reps to assist with theprocess.#There will also be a national steer on the holiday adjustment issues from SNCT which will inform local negotiations at LNCT on how this will look locally.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.51282085-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.51282085-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.51282085-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.51282085-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"north east residents scoop postcode lottery prize","story":"Six people in Peterhead are celebrating after winning £, each thanks to their lucky postcode.The Slains Court neighbours netted the winnings when AB YF was announced as a Daily Prize winner with People’s Postcode Lottery on Monday.People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson sent his well-wishes to the winners.He said: “What a great surprise to start your week!

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll adventure saddles up for public support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe owner of an Inveraray equine and outdoor activity centre is looking for customers# help as lockdown bites.It#s fair to say Andy Cameron could have had an easier start to running Argyll Adventure.The business has operated at Dalchenna Farm for two decades in its current format and -year-old Andy took over the reins at the end of .Argyll Adventure#s bread and butter is horse riding # trekking through the hills above Loch Fyne.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

Ross Nixon, and comes in the wake of a similar venture undertaken by Glasgow Warriorsrsquo professional players.ldquoWhen yoursquore walking in and around Selkirk, you canrsquot help noticing pieces of litter that have been left lying around, often when proper bins arenrsquot that far away, said Nixon.ldquoI thought it would be a good idea for Selkirk players to take a bin bag with them when they head out to take their daily exercise, picking up any litter they see next to paths or along roadside verges.ldquoWersquore lucky in Selkirk to have such unspoilt countryside to exercise in, so itrsquos a shame to see it spoiled by discarded empty bottles, food wrappers and general rubbish.ldquoI kicked off the campaign by nominating three members of our players ndash Aaron McColm, Ewan MacDougall and Liam Cassidy ndash to collect litter on their walks.ldquoEach of this trio will then challenge a further three players to collect litter, and in turn these three will nominate other team-mates, and so on.The project has the backing of Selkirk head coach Scott Wight.He said: ldquoItrsquos another way the club can put something back into the local community, though this time therersquos no sponsorship involved.ldquoItrsquos looking asitrsquos going to be a wee while before any rugby is going to be played, so this latest effort not only helps keep the players in touch with each other, itrsquos also providing a useful service for the Selkirk community.Meanwhile, Selkirk Rugby Club is to stage its annual Players Presentation Night on Fridayndash although this yearrsquos event will be a lsquovirtualrsquo get-together.The plan is for the clubrsquos coaches, players and rugby officials to be digitally linked via Zoom, with Selkirk head coach Scott Wight taking charge of proceedings.ldquoThe idea is to try and stick as closely as possible to the format normally used at the clubrsquos annual presentation nights, said Wight.ldquoA total of nine trophies are up for grabs, and the name of each award winner will be announced separately on the video link, followed by film footage, or photos, of that player in a match situation.ldquoShort addresses will be given by, among others, the clubrsquos chairman and its director of rugby, as well as recaps of the st and lsquoArsquo XVsrsquo seasons by the sidesrsquo respective team managers.\"It should be a fun

four-day working week Quite simply, it is as the name suggests.Instead of working five days, you will be working four ndash but rather than compressing the usual hours, an employee has reduced hours.For example, instead of working .hours, they will work  hours over the four days.Many have suggested the arrangement enables a better work le balance for employees and results in greater

heart of decisions made.He said: ldquoWe are ambitious for East Lothian and want to see it remain as a great place in which to live and work, which is well connected with good employment opportunities and sustainability principles at its heart.The local authority has asked Scottish Ministers to designate an area known as The Blindwells, Cockenzie and Climate Change Zone, as a National Development.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoWe want to see the new settlement at Blindwells developed as a fantastic community in which to live and work.ldquoIt should be a zero emissions community embracing climate change objectives and embracing blue green infrastructure and bioersity.ldquoThe former Cockenzie Power Station site offers signicant opportunity in terms of economic development and employment and work continues to understand its potential.ldquoIn our proposal for a National Development, we are suggesting that a Climate Change Zone is created between these sites, and including parts of, neighbouring communities and sites.ldquoWe believe this wider area, part of the former East Lothian coalfield, could be one of Scotlandrsquos top  locations for low carbon, sustainable inclusive growth and we are determined to grasp the opportunity.ldquoWe are making our case in a submission to the Scottish Government and will be carrying out public engagement on the extent of our

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-caravan-bid-rejected","story":"Lammermuir Livery and Stables wanted to provide accommodation for relief staff for their stable manager to live at their rural base at Castlemains Farm, Gford, to run the business.And they hoped East Lothian Council would back their planthe caravans were hidden from sight on nearby land already used to store mobile homes and other vehicles.However councillor officers refused to grant planning permission and the councilrsquos Local Review Body backed their decision during an online meeting this week when they refused an appeal against it.The planning application, which was retrospective also asked for permission to have an office, already built at the entrance to to site, but that was also rejected by the review body.Making their case for the caravans, the firm said: ldquoWhen considering this we were aware of the visual impact a caravan could have on the landscapeand decided the best option would be to site the caravan in the existing storage yard in an area designated for that purpose, this area already has caravans stored, which we have permission forand therefore the caravan would not be a new thing in that area.HoweverCouncillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairperson, described the decision to let people live in a storage area as lsquounacceptablersquo.He said: ldquoI do not think residential caravans on a storage site is an acceptable place for people to be living.The stables had also argued that there was not secure space within the equestrian buildings it had at he farm for an office and one needed to be built on another part of the land, however this was also dismissed by the review body.Members carried out inidual site visits to the farm ahead of meeting todayonline.Councillor Sue Kempson said: ldquoThe caravans are in the wrong place and should not be used as living accommodation on a storage site, it sets a precedent.ldquoLooking around the equestrian site there is plenty of room to provide a secure office so I am supporting the officersrsquo decision.Fellow body member Councillor Kenny McLeod made the decision unanimous when he ruled the office and caravans were too far away from the centre itself to be of any benefit.Planning officers refused the original application for temporary planning permission for five years for the office and caravans retrospectively, stating there was no business case for the equestrian business to support the need for the additional building and that the caravans would set an ldquoundesirable precedent.The applicants had told the review body their agent, who had been asked to provide a business case, had ldquovanished and they had no knowledge of the request."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-parents-need-know-school-reopen-date-confirmed","story":"The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done so in a way that will not distrupt efforts to controlthe virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following her announcement in parliament, the Scottish Goevrnment published their strategic framework for the reopening of schools.Here, well detail out what parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.Schools in Scotland are set to reopen on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools -

but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":null,"title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  -

For over a year this tiny offshoot has been sinking its roots deep. Above ground, however, itrsquos little more than a frond. With the solicitude of a father for his firstborn, Alan has been watering it since March, and awaiting the first leaves of the season. Buds eventually appeared, followed by the unfurling of glistening leaves the colour of old pennies. Just the other day he witnessed the arboreal equivalent of a childrsquos first day at school: a sparrow alighting on its branches, treating it like a real tree.The gardener who told us how to plant it said that it canrsquot get enough watering. Itrsquoll take however much you pour on it, allowing roots to take hold, and speeding its growth. So when eventually the clouds opened the other evening, it was the infant beech I thought of, soaking it up before reaching for the sky.As the rain pounded on the skylights, I stood at the window. Lit by the streetlamp on the village green, water filled the cobbled gutter. It rushed blackly towards the drain, a sprinkling of fallen apple blossom bobbing on the tide, asa wedding party had just passed. Through the small hours the downpour continued. I could lie awake all night listening to it. When I was growing up my bedroom was in an attic. Early in the morning seagullsrsquo flippers would patter over the roof, and the slightest breath of wind or rain was amplied by the rattling windows and nearby trees. The worse the weather, the more I enjoyed it.This astonishingly dry and sunny spring has been a boon during lockdown, the best possible antidote to gloom. I donrsquot like to imagine how miserable it would have beenthere had been incessant damp and cloudy skies. Yet surrounded as we are in Hoolet by fields of crops, and with flocks and herds munching grass, lack of rain means everything suffers. Cattle especially have been known to break out in search of water, thirst driving them slightly nuts.Following last weekrsquos cloudburst, the village has emerged from its dousing like a bridesmaid from the hairdresserrsquos. At first light the blackbirds were out in force, working their way across the green, combing every inch. I read that itrsquos been a good year for blackbirds, but that was hardly news. The place has been jumping with them for weeks, males chasing off rivals or fighting mid-air asreenacting the Battle of Britain. Females have been shopping for worms in pairs. No patch of lawn or grass goes unforaged, the birds keeping several feet apart, like customers at a supermarket checkout. Ousting wood pigeons and thrushes from telegraph poles, they declare their territory and every few minutes one flies past the window at such speed, yoursquod think it had been fired from a gun.A year or two past, one of our neighbours found a blackbird lying stricken in his garden. Alive but bleeding, it was being mobbed by other birds. He took out a chair, and sat near it for the rest of the afternoon, until it had recovered enough to fly off. He noticed it had been ringed, and when it began to make his garden its home, he called it Wilf. If he were ever tempted to rename his cottage, he could do worse than Wilf Hall.While we were speaking, Wilf chittered from the hedge. A day or two later, he turned up in our garden, two fields away from base, pecking for worms. With his gleaming ankle ring, and boot-polished feathers, he has a debonair look. I used to think they were all much the same, but once you start examining blackbirds, they emerge as iniduals: the plump matron, the one with a white feather on its wing, the scrawny, aggressive male, ceaselessly refuelling himself and his nestlings.Like pheasants, they allow us to get very close ndash Wilf especially, who seems fearless around people ndash but itrsquos not because they arenrsquot smart. You feel a pheasant is capable of walking on to the Christmas platter and arranging the carrots and parsnips around itself while it waits for the gravy blackbirds, on the other hand, know how to take advantage of what we can offer.Given the kerfuffle they make in the beech hedge, they could be devouring a packet of crisps. They make no attempt to hide their presence or keep their distance and whenever I start digging, the cry goes out. They donrsquot sit cutely on the spade handle like robins, but they hop within a few inches, spotting grubs I couldnrsquot detect even with a magnying glass. Once theyrsquore used to you, their confidence quickly grows.Some time ago I interviewed a woman who kept crows and rooks in her house, as they recovered from injuries. While we sat in her kitchen drinking coffee, a small rook click-clacked towards us over the tiles. Keeping one eye cocked on me, it pecked at my bare ankle, before growing bored and toddling off.The blackbirds in Hoolet arenrsquot tame, but nor are they shy. When worms began emerging after the rain, they were already in place, waiting. Itrsquos been a good week for them, and soon their well-fed broods will be joining the party on the green. Irsquom less certain about our bluetits. Occasional cheeping can be heard from the nest box, but itrsquos too early to knowtheyrsquoll survive. Caterpillars are their food of choice, but as the butterfly population declines, so does their larder. Might they have something put away in case of a rainy day "},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-neil-mackay-welcome-covids-new-world-order","story":"WITH little fanfare and certainly no shots fired, the island of Ireland took a historic step towards unication a few days ago.Thanks to coronavirus there will be no demonstrations in Belfast, no rioting or rabble-rousing. Politicians are too busy tackling the outbreak to squabble over the constitution and ramp up ision. Beneath the fog of pandemic, a very signicant sht has occurred in the geopolitical order, and no-one is taking that much notice.The British Government confirmed on Wednesday that there will now be checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK as part of Brexit. That effectively puts the border by the Irish Sea, at ports like Belfast ndash and therefore between Ulster and mainland Britain, not Ulster and Ireland. The whole of the UK will leave the customs union, but Northern Ireland will continue to enforce EU regulations at ports ndash just as the Republic does. Border posts will be built at Ulster ports.The republican dream of a united Ireland has come one step nearer. At any other time than during pandemic, such moves would have caused a constitutional crisis. There would be fears of violence. Security would increase. Ulster politicians would have been on their soapboxes. But within a day of the announcement, it was all but forgotten.This sht in Irish affairs is just one of myriad ways coronavirus is changing the world order. It is reshaping geopolitics as it changes societies, governments, and people around the globe. You could say wersquore entering the age of Covidrsquos New World Order.From one perspective, the virus has brutally undermined Brexit, its nostalgic appeal to supporters, and its harking back to some form of th-century Splendid Isolation ndash when the Victorian empire stood alone on the worldrsquos stage.Whether a Leaver or Remainer, itrsquos hard not to see Britainrsquos move away from the EU as anything other than a lonely prospect in light of Covid. The UK has the highest total deaths in Europe. Britainrsquos capabilities to deal with the infection ndash from testing and tracing to care homes and PPE ndash have been found wanting, while nations like Germany handled the crisis much more effectively. Can a tiny island really go it alone at a time of global crisis  Donrsquot we need our neighbours more than ever Or could coronavirus confirm for some that the drawbridge should remain pulled up  The pandemic is already stirring a toxic stew of racism, immigration, and border controls. In a world of closed borders, reduced travel and fear of infection, might the hard-right vision of Brexit broaden its appeal  There are already fears in a number of countries that coronavirus is a gt to extremists, and nationalism is on the rise across the world.Here in Scotland, coronavirus has inserted itself into the DNA of the debate about the union. How will the pandemic play out when it comes to Scottish independence  In the wake of the virus, will Scotland going it alone be seen as absurd as Brexit  Or will the growing ndash yet in truth still quite insignicant ndash ergence between the UK and Scottish governments on the handling of coronavirus make the fires of independence burn stronger  Beyond the presentational skills of the First Minister and the Prime Minister, however, therersquos not really that great a dference in the way Holyrood and Westminster have dealt with the outbreak.Unlike Brexit, though, Scottish independence isnrsquot a done deal. So, will people have the stomach for more constitutional chaos once normality s  Amid the coming global economic meltdown ndash set to rival the Great Crash of  ndash how many voters will want to risk more financial jeopardy with separation from the UK  Public mood matters.The Yes movement tilts strongly towards Europe. However, even the most staunch European is starting to feel uneasy about the EUrsquos behaviour amid coronavirus. Therersquos a real risk the European project could unravelmember states emerge from the outbreak unevenly ndashthe rich north prospers and the poor south suffers. There are east-west tensions too. Restricting aid to weak states could lead to the EU tearing itself apart.Former Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni is now the EUrsquos economy commissioner. He has warned about the pandemic causing economic ision and threatening stability and unity. Greece, Italy, Spain and Croatia are facing falls in GDP of above %, while Germany looks to be facing a squeeze of about . and Austria .. Memories of Germanyrsquos treatment of Greece after the  financial crash remain raw.ldquoWhat is clear is the uneven level of the recovery and the risks this creates to our single market, Gentiloni said, adding: ldquoThis is something that I could even define as an existential threat to the building of the Union.However, the reverse is also true. If the EU can manage recovery fairly and pull together it will emerge stronger, and that could be the making of Europe ndash cementing its place as a world superpower. More integration in Europe, not less, would pave the way to an equal playing field for all member states.The UN secretary general, Antoacutenio Guterres, has said: ldquoThe relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysal. Covid- is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.The big issue haunting European recovery is how it is paid for ndash loans or grants  France, Spain and Italy favour grants, Germany and the Netherlands back loans. Gentiloni has said grants represent ldquothe principle of solidarity. Loans will make poorer countries poorer. If that happens, Brexit ndash which most Europeans see as madness ndash may look less crazy. The Dutch have already been told by Spain that ldquoa first-class cabin would not protect you when the ship sinks.Self-evidently, both emotionally and psychologically, the pandemic undermines the European ideal. Nations are coping with the outbreak as they see fit, not how Brussels deems. Borders have been strengthened. All this plays into the populist agenda of politicians like Italyrsquos Matteo Salvini, whose anti-EU rhetoric is gathering traction ndash one recent poll showed % of Italians want to quit the EU.The EU has also failed to rein in the authoritarian Viktor Orban of Hungary, who has used coronavirus to undermine democracy, silence opposition and smother the press. If the EU, which was built to extend democracy across the continent, cannot control a man like Orban, then what does it stand for Europe is the standard-bearer of globalisation, but globalisationrsquos reputation has been shredded in recent years, thanks to the financial crash and the rise of right-wing nationalism around the world from America First Trumpism to Brazil, India and the Philippines. Covid has put globalism in intensive care.For a quick example of Covidrsquos contraction of global commerce, trade and movement look to Heathrow, one of the worldrsquos busiest airports. Passenger numbers have dropped by %. World trade in goods could shrink by up to % this year.The global supply chain has been fractured ndash goods made on one side of the planet are taking longer to reach the other side. Will autarky ndash national self-sufficiency ndash be the next big buzzword when it comes to the direction the planet takes  People across the world ndash especially here at home ndash are asking why their governments didnrsquot have stockpiles of protective gear, why there werenrsquot enough ventilators, why it took so long to get testing supplies  Covid could create a groundswell of opinion which sees electorates favouring nation states looking after themselves, while turning their backs on international co-operation.Trade and travel bring down borders ndash at least in the mind. But with trade and travel in deep freeze, the worldrsquos mood music could change drastically. As economic pain bites through the recovery period, therersquos likely to be a wholesale reappraisal of international aid in many countries. Indiarsquos populist leader Narendra Modi says a new era of economic self-reliance has already started. Japan will subsidise firms that bring their factories back home as part of its recovery package. The EU has talked of ldquostrategic autonomy.Globalisation has as many curses as it does blessings ndash but one thingrsquos sure, coronavirus proves that the world must pull together at a time of crisis, not apart. A vaccine will one day be found by scientists from many countries working in unity. No country can stand alone against global threats.Countries that have tried to go it alone during Covid have come out worse. Sweden, which took its own slack and eccentric approach to preventative measures, now has the highest per-capita death rate on the planet. This in itself shakes one of the old world orderrsquos received wisdoms: the guarantee that Scandinavian countries will always get things right. On the flip side, other small nations seem to be proving that big is not necessarily best. The countries which have most prevailed are states like New Zealand and South Korea.And then therersquos America. Itrsquos still the worldrsquos superpower, but in name only. The Trump administrationrsquos handling of coronavirus has been risible and dangerous ndash from the president suggesting people inject bleach and his rabble-rousing press conferences, to the countryrsquos escalating death toll and paramilitary-style anti-lockdown demos. In general, populist administrations like Trumprsquos have done badly during the pandemic ndash particularly Brazilrsquos president Jair Bolsonaro, who is ruling over chaos.The idea that the US still provides global leadership was on the skids long before Covid arrived, but the pandemic has killed off any notion that America remains the worldrsquos policeman. When Trump turned on the World Health Organisation over coronavirus, it illustrated not only American withdrawal from the world, but also the fragility of international organisations and the waning of globalisation as a political philosophy.America also shows how, in this age of political polarisation, Covid can force even deeper wedges between a population. By and large, Trumprsquos nativist base wants protective measures to end, while Democrats take a more cautious European approach. These isions have already turned ugly with armed protesters entering Michiganrsquos state capitol as legislators debated coronavirus emergency powers.As Americarsquos role as global leader evaporates, China waits in the wings to step forward as the dominant world power. When coronavirus emerged, there was speculation that Beijingrsquos handling of the outbreak was so bad the Communist Party might fall. Today, therersquos no chance of that ndash the nation is recovering, and has been seen to handle the crisis relatively well. It is now aggressively fighting back against attacks by Trump and his supporters that China was to blame for the outbreak and the extent of global deaths.China seemed to reflect all the competing tensions in the world relating to coronavirus ndash the role of America, the trouble in Europe, the future place of Beijing in the world ndash when it promised to send tonnes of medical equipment to Italy, at a time when Western states were failing to help. China also sent medical teams to Iran and supplies to Serbia whose president dismissed claims of European solidarity as a fairy tale, saying ldquothe only country that can help us is China.That vignette should send a chill down the spine of anyone who believes in democracy. If nations like Italy need China to bail them out then democracy is in trouble ndash it has been eroded at home, and undermined abroad. While Beijing embarks on this PR campaign for dictatorship, it is using Covid as a cover to crush dissent in Hong Kong.The poor performance by both the British and American administrations shows that the previous dominant dynamic in world affairs ndash US action backed by British support ndash is now a thing of the past.Russia and its place in the world could also face great change thanks to Covid. Without doubt, the Kremlin is lying about the number of Russian dead. Putinrsquos regime is Soviet when it comes to truth ndash facts are what the government says they are. However, death changes a lot, and Putinrsquos ratings have now fallen to a historic low. Could coronavirus result in a post-Putin era  Or a reboot of glasnost ndash the spirit of openness which helped bring down Communism  Putinrsquos iron grip on power makes it unlikely, but even in Russia we see Covid warping the political landscape.The Middle East is also starting to realign. After Saudi Arabia wounded the US fracking industry by flooding the world with cheap oil during this financially crippling pandemic, Trump, with his eyes fixed firmly on the stock market, took action. He withdrew air defence batteries, there to protect the kingdom from Iran, and pulled back troops, navy and fighter jets. The US-Saudi relationship was, until now, immutable. But thatrsquos no longer true thanks to Covid ndash and the fact that oil prices are so low they donrsquot justy a US military presence to protect petroleum states like Saudi. US officials have even said that Iran no longer poses a threat to American strategic interests in the Gulf. Barely noticed, this is one of the greatest seismic shts in geopolitics wrought by coronavirus.Simultaneously, Iran is starting to withdraw some of its military from Syria where it has been backing the Assad regime. In turn, this reduces tensions with Israel in the region. The sands are shting in the Middle East because of coronavirus, just as they are across the entire planet.As Francersquos president Emmanuel Macron predicts of the outbreak: ldquoThis period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening. The day after when we have won, it will not be ato the day before.Coronavirus has already warped the political world, and wersquore still just a few months into the pandemic. Much change lies ahead ndash whether that change is good or bad lies in all our hands."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-tamburrinis-lockdown-feast-caesar-salad-fried-chicken-chococolate-cate-chocolate-sorbet","story":"This weeks recipes are a sumptuous three-course meal fit for any table:Caesar salad with lettuce emulsionServes - starters Romaine lettuce hearts, cut into bite sized bitesg parmesan shavings fillets of good quality anchovies in oil, halved waysFor the bread croutons Day old baguetteExtra virgin olive oilSea saltFor the dressingfrac cloves of garlic, green germ removed and finely grated fillets of salted anchovies in oil free range eggsml red wine vinegartsp Dijon mustardml grapeseed oilg finely grated parmesanJuice of frac lemonfrac tsp of Worcestershire sauce drops of TabascoSalt and black pepper to tasteFor the lettuce emulsiong Baby gems leaves, green only ndash washed frac tsp Dijon mustardml vegetable oilml cold waterTable saltFor the bread tuillesPreheat the oven to C ndash cut  very thinly slices from the baguette, so you have  per person.

She is an impressive leader. And not just in her delivery.Ms Sturgeonrsquos political handling of this crisis has also been exemplary. She has followed essentially the same strategy as the UK Government, made all the same mistakes and then some, but has somehow managed to devolve responsibility for those mistakes to Westminster.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: No country for old men. The bitter harvest in Scotlandrsquos care homesLast week, she unveiled her four-step programme for ing to normality which is, in all major respects, the same as the UK one. But by delaying it a fortnight, while accusing Boris Johnson of playing ldquoRussian roulette with peoplersquos lives she has made it sound asshersquos protected Scots from a government of Bolsanaro-emulating herd immunity fanatics.There is not a great deal of evidence for this. Nicola Sturgeon said a fortnight ago that it was not safe to follow the UK path because the ldquoall-important R number in Scotland was too high at between . and .. Yet last week, as she announced her new regime, the R number was still between . and ..She insists that the number of infections is down, which is true. But the rate of spread of the virus, which R measures, is not crucially dependent on the number of cases. The risk of the pandemic getting loose again has changed very little.But people think it has, and in politics, that is all that really matters. ldquo#ThankYouNicola was trending on social media. The SNP is riding ever higher in popularity. The FMrsquos treatment by opposition leaders in the chamber sounded almost respectful.There has been an assumption, shared by most of the Scottish media, that Nicola Sturgeon is showing the way, not following a few steps behind. Her government commands a degree of respect that Westminster lacks. ldquoIrsquom sorry to interrupt you, Mr Swinney, said a reverential Good Morning Scotland presenter the day after the route map was unveiled.Yet, in that very interview, the Deputy First Minister all but admitted that the governmentrsquos aim of , contact tracers by next week was falling way short. Only  have been signed up, but Swinney assured us that this would be quite enough. Oh yes.On testing, the Scottish Governmentrsquos record is poor any way you look at it. Not only in contact tracing which is well behind England, where , tracers have been recruited, but also in the headline number of tests.The UK was testing , a day last week and is on course for , a day. In Scotland only , are being tested, according to the Scottish Parliament Information Service. On a per-capita basis it should be almost ten times that.Now, the purpose of all this testing is admittedly unclear, north and south of the Border. The clinical advisers in Scotland have always been distinctly cool on community testing, at least in the current phase. The former CMO, Dr Catherine Catherwood, famously called it a ldquodistraction.However, everyone agrees now that one of the major failings of the UKrsquos response to the pandemic was a lack of preparedness and a failure to install the architecture of TTI: test, track and isolate. Progress in Scotland can only be described as glacial.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Its easy to scare people into staying home harder to persuade them to come out againThen there is the avoidable tragedy in Scotlandrsquos care homes, which I wrote about last week. This was the policy, hotly denied, that old people were cleared out of acute hospitals without proper testing and sent often to care homes where the virus spread rapidly.Last week, the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, finally came clean about the elderly clearance, and said nearly , had been discharged in March alone. She had previously said only  had been so decanted.This is a serious error and calls into question the competence of the minister and the health service bureaucrats upon whom she relies. It comes on top of the inexplicable failure to inform the public about the major Covid outbreak in February at a Nike conference in Edinburgh.There is every sign of a massive buck-passing operation between the NHS Scotland, Public Health Scotland, the Chief Medical Officer, the Care Inspectorate and the private care homes, all trying to blame each other for the care home scandal.Nicola Sturgeon admitted last week that there had been a panic reaction to the forecast of , Covid deaths made in mid-March by the disgraced Imperial College epidemiologist, Professor Neil Ferguson. She said hospitals feared they were about to be ldquofilled up with coronavirus cases and so discharged as many old patients as possible into care. In the event, the wards have lain empty as old people died.Nearly half of all Covid deaths in Scotland have been in care homes. The misery this policy has inflicted on Scotlandrsquos senior citizens, dying in cruel isolation, is unimaginable.Lessons will be learned etc. However, no-one seems to regard these as lessons particularly for the First Minister. Similarly, criticism of confusions in her route map to normality go right over her head.Garden centres and bowling greens can open, but people canrsquot use the toilets, which make it rather pointless. The ldquoblended solution to teaching means parents will have to remain at home even after schools go back in August. The tourism and hospitality industry is in despair, forecasting losses of up to , jobs.But Nicola Sturgeon is safe and socially distanced from blame. She has the shield of confidence around her, burnished by the flattering attentions of legions SNP supporters, who dominate social media.It has now become clear that the PMrsquos closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been bending the lockdown rules to travel Durham, with the full sanction of Boris Johnson.The UK media seems mainly interested in using Scotland as a stick to beat the Prime Minister. The Sky presenter, Kay Burley, urged UK political leaders last week to ldquotake a leaf out of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos book.It is also, of course, because Boris Johnsonrsquos handling of the crisis has been confused and erratic. The messaging about ldquoStay Alert was vague, the rules about travel incomprehensible, the attempt to reopen the schools cack-handed.:Iain Macwhirter: Failures over testing means no end to coronavirus lockdown in ScotlandThe UK Government has oscillated between promises of wonder apps and ldquogame-changing breakthroughs, like antibody tests, and panicky pronouncements that have led to invasive crackdowns by the police. The decision to introduce draconian -day quarantine for travellers may have made sense two or three months ago, but seems pointless now.Westminsterrsquos approach has been an object lesson in poor leadership, which will be examined by students of governance for many years.

But it is apparent it is not going to happen in one or two years.ldquoIt was agreed we would need to be looking at funding to run the hill. To do that we needed to be able to show potential investors, our work within the community, within the estate or around the estate. With climate change we have to be more creative than worrying about a ski resort. Le is changing whether we like it or not.\"ldquoWhen the Trust was conceived the funicular was running, there was an operator there. The situation has changed dramatically.She added that the pop-up ice rink is one of several ideas that have been discussed.ldquoPeople have talked to us about a pump track, allotments, a velodrome. The ideas are massive and wonderful.ldquoAsset transfer is not a short-term gain. This will take years not months, but our goal hasnrsquot changed and HIE has been nothing but helpful.A spokesman for HIE said: ldquoThere is no specic requirement for a community group to undertake a dferent commercial project as a pre-requirement for a successful asset transfer request.ldquoWe believe the trust is aware of this but also recognise that they cover the wider Aviemore and Glenmore area and not just Cairngorm and that they do need to generate their own income.He added: ldquoWe have supported the trust in many ways, including providing access to expertise and advice on community ownership, and funding two posts to help them develop their future plans.\"ldquoAGCT has also made us aware of their idea for a pop-up ice rink.

To complain that Scotland is at least \"three weeks behind England\" ignores the fact that the virus has taken time to spread northwards. It is now some weeks since Covid- peaked in London. Then for some reason he criticises the First Minister for pursuing a four-phased approach to easing lockdown which is \"in sharp contrast to what the Prime Minister has introduced\". But surely such a phased approach in England is exactly what Boris Johnson announced, and indeed Downing Street has just claimed credit for what is now being rolled out in Scotland The real problem, however, for Mr Stevenson is public reaction. I think that it is abundantly clear that the cautious and measured approach of our First Minister commands considerable public support, which stands in stark contrast with how Boris Johnsonrsquos decisions are perceived. His rushed and ill-thought-out decision to insist that schools in England should be opened on June  is a classic example of how not to proceed. While here in Scotland the decision to bring pupils back to school on August  Not surprisingly the mood in England is one of confusion and concern. According to reports, the UK Governmentrsquos policy to reopen schools will not be followed by perhaps as many as  local authorities. Teaching unions have expressed serious reservations on behalf of their members. Schools and teachers have been given little time to physically prepare their teaching programmes, classrooms, toilets and playgrounds for the childrenrsquos safe . The scientic advice also urges caution. The Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England warns that ldquothe essential well-ing local test, trace and isolate protocols will not be in place in England by early June, Not surprisingly the latest opinion poll suggests that the June  start has the support of only  per cent of parents a large majority would prefer a September . This is in marked contrast to experience here, where I would suggest public support for the \"glacial easing\" remains strong.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.STRUAN Stevensons article was a timely reminder,such were needed, that the Tories have,anything, consolidated their position as the Nasty Party. His advocacy of rapid easing of lockdown belittles the suffering of those who have already died from the effects of the virus, the courage and dedication of those in the NHS and the care sector and the fears of those of us who, because of existing medical conditions, are at high riskwe contract the virus. While recognising the damage that the economy is suffering, the cavalier disregard he displays for the human costs likely to be incurred through easing too much, too soon, is appalling.We should, of course, not be surprised by this. The UK has a Prime Minister who lies, sleeps around and failed to take action in the early stages of the pandemic, preferring meaningless twaddle about British exceptionalism. In Priti Patel we have a Home Secretary who smirkingly advances legislation that would shut off the opportunities granted to her family in the past ldquopull up the drawbridge, Im OK. Jacob Rees-Mogg openly flaunts the opportunities he has helped to create for dubious financial deals, the profits from which he stashes away in overseas tax havens until such time as this Government provides similar facilities for the ultra-rich within the country. Having promised that food standards would not be compromised in the search for trade deals toreplace those within the EU, Parliament then votes to remove all such protection to appease the United States.As for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings, words fail me. His complete disregard for the letter and spirit of the emergency measures, is beyond belief.What is also surprising, in a smaller way, is that you chose to devote half a page to Mr Stevensons nonsense.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.IT is becoming abundantly clear with each passing day that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos calculated decision to \"grandstand\" her position as First Minister by trailing Englandrsquos easing of the Corona lockdown in order for Scotland \"to go its own way\" is beginning to backfire on her ndash indeed, Struan Stevenson astutely sees through her lame excuses that she is not playing politics .Also, the SNPrsquos request for Westminster to extend the furlough scheme beyond October for Scotland has been essentially denied, piling pressure on the First Minister to catch up with England in respect of lockdown easing.Now, instead of being perceived as leading from the front, increasingly, Ms Sturgeon is going to be perceived as passively following from behind ndash not a good track-record for entering the  Holyrood elections.Philip Adams, Crosslee.I WAS going to sit down and compose a y, erudite response to Struan Stevensons interesting take on the Scottish Governments proposed road map. Then I read your leader columnand put my pen away.Alastair Clark, Stranraer.STRUAN Stevenson has a good go at the Scottish Government. Fine, thats what Tories do, but I must comment on his sign-off, \"Historically, pandemics either ended with the medical containment of the disease, which in our case could occur with the development of a vaccine, or they end when society loses its fear of the virus\"He suggests that since a vaccine is a long way off, \"its time we lost our fear\".Grand, there are three ways to do this.First, be immune. Secondly, die of the virus. Or of course, you could go the third way, and thats to be so rich and isolated from real le, as it is lived by most of the rest of us, that you are not affected by it, nor do you have to give a hoot.AJ Clarence, Prestwick.I THINK I am a reasonably tolerant man. I very rarely lose my temper. But I am enraged by Dominic Cummingss behaviour. How dare he  The lockdown instructions were very clear, despite the weasel words of the deputy English Chief Medical Officer, Jenny Harries. She knows that she dare not say anything against her masters for fear of losing her job.Everyone and their auntie knows that he did the wrong thing. Trying to excuse it on a technicality just makes it worse. Then we are told it was because he was concerned for his four-year-old son. Really  Did he not have any other options open to him  Does he not have any friends who live locally  I suppose not. But whose fault is that Why should I or anyone  follow Matt Hancocks instruction  Ill tell you why. Because it raises the risk to others.Robin Mather, Musselburgh.DOMINIC Cummings ndash the perfect example of the adage dont do as I do, do as I tell you.Dave Biggart, Kilmacolm.INTERESTING that despite reasonably positive public opinion of Nicola Sturgeons handling of the pandemic in Scotland, there were three negative letters in The Herald . The performance of the Scottish Government has certainly not been flawless, but the criticism, to paraphrase Mr James Martin, is pathetic.First, Ms Sturgeon would have been severely criticisedshe had erged from the UK at the beginning of the outbreak, and the UK was slow. Secondly, as a retired clinician, I disagree with retired NHS manager Danny Crawford about patient confidentiality. It was, presumably, suggested by clinicians and accepted by the First Minister. It may be a moot point, but I would side with that view. If there was poor contact tracing, that needs to be avoided in the future.Finally, I get the impression that whatever Ms Sturgeon and the current Scottish Government do, these correspondents and their ilk will find a reason to criticise. R McMurtrie talks about Ms Sturgeons empathy, but many would consider hers as genuine concern for others. Would he prefer Boris Johnsons or Priti Patels form of \"empathy\" George Rhind, Clydebank.UNTIL now, according to the UK Government daily reports, approximately three million people in England have been tested for Covid-. On a pro rata basis that could mean that we have tested approximately , people in Scotland. However, any figures I have heard do not at all approach this figure.I accept that, as the First Minister says, testing is not the silver bullet, but as it is being touted strongly by the World Health Organisation, surely we should be maximising our efforts in this regard and letting the Scottish people know the results.W MacIntyre, East Kilbride.THE proposedof golf to being one of our permitted activities has been greeted with a fanfare. Further along the Scottish Governments route map, we are advised to drive no more than five miles.The authors of this document are obviously unaware of the fact that many golfers live as many as  or more miles from their clubs. I think in particular of several clubs on the Ayrshire and east coasts which depend for survival upon members who live in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh.Tough luck, I suppose.David Miller, Milngavie.Read more: Letters: We have paid a high price for Scotlands slow virus response"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2050526.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fifth-rbs-mortgage-customers-approved-mortgage-payment-holidays","story":"RBS has confirmed that , of its m mortgage customers across the UK have so far been approved for mortgage repayment holidays.Customers affected have been emailed to let them know that they will benefit from the full three month offering which will run from May to July.Latest figures from UK Finance show across the banking industry, . million mortgage payment holidays have been issued as of May  ndash equivalent to one in six mortgages.It comes as the partly taxpayer-owned Edinburgh-based bank set aside pound million to pay for potential losses related to coronvirus as customers struggle to cope with loan repayments.Operating profits at the bank, still majority owned by the taxpayer after being bailed out in the financial crisis, halved to poundm in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period a year earlier as a result.While banks in general have been criticised over the amount of lending they have done through the Chancellors coronavirus business interruption loans scheme , RBS appears to have been punching above its weight relatively, having approved pound. billion, or more than , loans.That is around % of the total CBILS approved loans so far.The chief financial officer, Katie Murray, has said that while CBILS would not be hugely profitable for the lender she expected a ldquonominalfrom the loans.It has also provided , customers with pound.bm through the Bounce Back Loan Scheme in the three weeks since its launch although one in five have not been been approved.RBS, which is changing its parent name to NatWest this year, says it has removed late credit card payment fees.And it has frozen interest rates on overdrafts at current levels while removing all fees until at least the end of June.A Royal Bank of Scotland spokesman said: ldquoWersquore committed to supporting our customers through this unprecedented crisis, and itrsquos why wersquove introduced a range of measures including mortgage, credit card and loan payment holidays and have proactively spoken to over , customers who are elderly, vulnerable or in long term isolation.

The industry looks forward to regulatory guidance being finalised swtly to ensure both borrowers and lenders can plan over the coming weeks. Meanwhile those borrowers who have already taken a mortgage payment holiday and can afford to make payments are encouraged to do so, as this will reduce the level of their repayments in the long run.ldquoFor those borrowers who have not already applied for a mortgage payment holiday, the industry supports the extension of the availability of payment holidays until October ,  as this will provide much-needed breathing space for borrowers who need it. Lenders are also committed to the moratorium on involuntary repossessions to ensure no homeowner loses the roof over their head because of Covid- related repayment dficulties.ldquoA payment holiday may not be the right choice for everyone, and borrowers should only applythey need one.

The first five years of le are the ones in which wildcats are most likely to produce and successfully rear kittens.ldquoSo having that age range well represented in the breeding population is really important. Having a majority of older cats, for example, wouldnrsquot be helpful for a developing population.ldquoItrsquos also about choosing animals as unrelated to each other as possible.ldquoIt comes down to something called lsquomean kinshiprsquo ndash how related one animal is to another in the population.ldquoMaybe therersquos an animal that has not bred for several years and those wildcat genes are not widely present in the population ndash those are genes that you would want to introduce into the population as this helps increase the genetic ersity.Mr Barclay said the Scottish wildcat was by no means out of the woods but added that its prospects may now be a little brighter.ldquoThe wildcat breeding season generally begins in April, May, June, he added.ldquoI know that a couple of kittens have been born already. At the Aigas Field Centre they have had their first litters already. We hope there are many other kittens on their way at other collections.ldquoWe are at a point in time when we can look at the captive population and say, wow, this really gives us some viable options to help support wildcat recovery in the wild."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic-cummings-controversy-unfolded-timeline-events","story":"Mr Cummings says he made the journey for childcare purposes.

Itrsquos educational but still fun.STEM from Home has been born from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathscamps that CGI has been running for the past year in UK schools and communities to encourage students to think about a STEM career.When the coronavirus lockdown was announced, it was decided to try and recreate the camps online and, incredibly, the technological wizards at CGI managed to have STEM from Home up and running within two days.It was trialled internally but went down so well that, after just the first week, staff asked to share it with family, friends and clients.As the demand was there, CGI decided to make it accessible online for anyone to use, with new content released every week to keep youngsters engaged.ldquoItrsquos presented in a very creative way to keep their interest and wersquove had amazing feedback, said Green. ldquoWe are a business organisation and although we do community outreach this is on a completely dferent scale. The reach of it has been immense.As well as competitions and programming, children are also challenged to take part in physical activities, including nature trails and designing their own home exercise routine.The competitions are popular with so many good entries that it can sometimes be dficult to decide on a winner, according to Green. Some of the best are posted online.ldquoA lot of effort goes in to some of them and I know from my own children that they look at some of the designs and are inspired by seeing what others do, she said.Around , CGI staff members receive packs for their children each week and there have been around , page views of the packs on the CGI UK website.ldquoItrsquos been shared very widely by our members and clients as well as community groups and schools we have had relationships with, said Luke Kittow who creates the content. ldquoItrsquos good to see that schools are finding it useful and are confident that they are giving children content that is going to work with the existing curriculum.ldquoHaving said that, hands-on learning engages children more than working from a text book.Some parents sit down with children to work through the packs but others who may not be as tech savvy as their youngsters leave them to get on with it. ldquoThe children seem to love it, said Kittow. ldquoThey like how it relates to real le topics that they are genuinely interested in.It is not necessary to download any software to complete the packs as the activities can be opened in a web browser. ldquoThe great thing about the packs is that they are very adaptable and very much open to interpretation, said Kittow.ldquoThey can be as complex or simple as you like which is why they can reach such a wide age range.

To mark the forthcoming Channel  remake of All Creatures Great and Small, BBC showed a couple of old episodes of the Sunday night drama, plus a documentary about its popularity.In two shakes of a lambrsquos tail we were back in trsquoYorkshire Dales with unassuming James Herriot, shouty Siegfried and his naughty little brother Tristan, plus Mrs Pumphreyrsquos Tricki-Woo .It was all a universe away from Noel Fitzpatrick, aka Channel rsquos The Supervet. The James Herriot of the noughties is a pioneering orthopaedic-neuro veterinary surgeon forever pushing the boundaries of possibility. ldquoCutting edge in All Creatures Great and Small, in contrast, was someone donning a rubber glove before inserting an arm into a cowrsquos backside.Think, then, of Scottish Vets Down Under, a new -part documentary series, as a pleasant middle ground between homely All Creatures and shiny, high-tech The Supervet.Made by the Aussie firm WildBear Entertainment for BBC Scotland, it was a true story of two young vets who met  years ago at university and became best pals.Dr Chris Ellison was the tall one who specialised in small animals, while Dr Mike Whiteford was the short stop who ran an equine hospital.The voiceover introduced them as two Scottish vets who had ldquoturned their lives upside down and set out on an adventure of a letime, which made it sound as though they were newly arrived.As we learned later, Dr Mike went out  years ago, with Dr Chris following. Both had successful practices in the rural town of Bendingo. It would have been more dramaticthey had just been starting out, but you canrsquot have everything.As it was, the thrills in Scottish Vets Down Under were of the small-scale, animal-centred iety. That was fine by me, as was Drs Mike and Chris being ordinary, unassuming guys rather than the dreaded ldquocharacters so many reality television series seek. Uncomplicated was good. It was dferent. Whether we will still be feeling that way a few more episodes in, who knows.First client through the door of Bendingo Animal Hospital was a wedge-tailed eagle found lying on its stomach in a paddock. With a wing-span of . metres, these birds can down a kangaroo. Dr Chris, wisely, sent the bird for a snooze while he examined him. While doing so he found out that ldquohe was in fact a ldquoshe.There were no breaks in the wings, which left the possibility of poisoning. Only thing for it was to wait and hope.Arriving at Dr Mikersquos was a week old foal that had run into a metal fence. A facial injury would be bad news for any creature, but especially one set to be a racehorse. After an op by Dr Mike and his fiancee Dr Sarah Jalim, it was a bandage round the nose for the foal. Another case of wait and see.Easier in one way was the case of Clive the dog. Clive, -years-young, had terrible earache. He wouldnrsquot let his beloved owner, Kay, near his lug. Like the wedge-tailed eagle, Clive was sent on a snooze.The problem was a small grass seed wedged in his ear. ldquoLike little daggers, said Chrisrsquos fiance, Dr Claire. She plucked out the one in the ear, plus several more on his coat, and delivered him back into the arms of Kay, who gave a loud sigh of relief.Otherwise, the chaps meet a koala and learned how to do a ldquokoala bellow.

Forcing MPs to choose between the safety of our communities and equal representation is unacceptable.“Parliament must be a forum where every part of the United Kingdom can participate equally. The Secretary of State knows this better than most and the challenges posed to communities that are more distant from parliament. We are calling on him to be a voice for equal representation in government.”Mr Jack was questioned on the issue in parliament yesterday, by SNP MP Allan Dorans. Mr Jack said: #Members of Parliament are key workers. More importantly, as a cabinet minister and a secretary of state, it is right that I should be here in the chamber so that I can be properly scrutinised and answer these questions.#I came down at the weekend and travelled on a train very safely. I willsafely and I will be isolating myself when I do, but that is solely because I go back to family. I do not see why we cannot have proper scrutiny of parliament when we have the virtual proceedings, which work for some, but for me it is absolutely about being here, being scrutinised and being at the Dispatch Box.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full.

Signicant adjustments will also be required across our public transport services as the lockdown is eased in the coming weeks and months and the safety of the travelling public is hugely important.“The committee wants to hear about the experiences of iniduals and businesses and whether they feel they have received the support they need to survive and recover from this crisis.“We also want to learn about examples of good practice as we consider what lessons can be learned about the response to the pandemic and also how existing practices may need to change as we move forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

Hatston will be open from .am to .pm and Garson from .am to .am. Both will be closed between .pm and .pm.Andrew Drever, vice-chair of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We thank folk for their patience while our sites were closed, as we waited for national advice on essential travel in Scotland to change.“I hope people will welcome the step-by-step approach we are taking to opening the sites again and understand the need for them to operate dferently to the way they did before the pandemic.“This is to ensure the safety of our staff and visitors to the sites. Limiting the number of cars and visitors on site at any particular time will enable social and physical distancing. We would urge those visiting to stay at least two metres away from staff and from other visitors on site.”Councillor Drever said: “Both sites are likely to be very busy for the first few days. To avoid the risk of waiting in long queues, we would ask folk to use them onlyit is absolutely necessary.“As a way to spread visits across the week, we are suggesting that you make your visit –possible – on your normal bin collection day. If your bin collection day is a Mondaywe’d suggest that you visit on a Saturday instead.”He added: “As summer approaches we know that many folk will be keen to dispose of waste from their gardens.“That’s why we are concentrating on this when the sites re-open as part of the phased approach we are taking. For the time being, no other materials can be disposed of at Hatston or Garson.”This will be kept under review and, when possible, the sites will start to take other materials as well.Decisions on opening the other HWRCs – and recycling points in the isles – will be taken at a later date as part of the phased approach the council is taking.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England.

Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s.

Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear.

A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Bro. Edward Stevenson has called on the members to take part on Tuesday, May  The Order commented: “For many hundreds of years, when the dangers of war raged and plagues and epidemics came upon the land, National Days of Prayer were held as a positive response from the people in those dficult times.“The date – th of May – has deliberately been chosen as it had considerable signicance during the Second World War. When Britain was close to defeat, and the entire British Army was trapped at Dunkirk, King George VI called for a National Day of Prayer on th May, . This would be the first of seven such days of prayer during the War.“In a national broadcast, His Majesty urged the people of the United Kingdom to turn back to God in a spirit of repentance and plead for Divine help.”Mr Stevenson said: “In this time of great trouble, when thousands of lives have been lost to the Coronavirus and many families have been left bereaved I would ask the Orange Institution to stand firm and take part in a day of prayer.“As an Institution, our faith is of great importance and it is appropriate at this time that we set aside a day to pray for our nation during this pandemic. We should pray for the NHS and the frontline workers, for families, and for our government who face dficult decisions.“I would encourage as many members of the Orange Institution as possible to take part in this day of prayer. Also, raise awareness of this event with your family and friends. The day of prayer should be in the quiet of your home.”The Grand Master added: “I have been thinking of a Bible verse I would like to share. It is Romans chapter  verse  ‘Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer’.”To assist with the day of prayer, a special page has been set up on the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland website – goli.org.uk dayofprayer - which includes suggested points for prayer and passages of scripture.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

We were fortunate enough to have mummy and daddy at home with us and they didn#t die in hospital.But the sacrices we had to make, my sister couldn#t come to see them because she just had surgery to her ankle so she never got to see daddy and mummy before they died at all.When you#re Joe Bloggs and abide by the laws of the country you can#t do it. Yet he seems to have taken the law into his own hands.It#s gone too far. Why are they stipulating rules to keep society safe and he deems himself worthy to do whatever he wants Read More Coronavirus: Daughter#s #heartbreak and nightmare# after both her parents pass awayMs O#Connell said she also became ill with the virus but still had to care for her family.There are lots of people who get the virus and can continue doing what they need to do. So he could have continued looking after his children instead of bringing them to his grandparents to be looked after.When I look at the loss that we have had in our family, when mummy and daddy died I had the disease and continued to look after them.So you can fight on through it. It took me a long time to get over the disease and I#ve only recently got rid of the symptoms completely.As restrictions begin to ease in Northern Ireland, she appealed for the public not to become complacent.When I watch people walking in groups past my window, I feel like telling them to come into my living room to see what this disease is like, she said. It#s not a pretty thing to watch. I do worry about there being another mad outbreak in a couple of months as the rules soften.We buried a mummy and a daddy and I don#t think there#s any concept of how catastrophic their lives would bethe same thing happened to them - and I mean catastrophic.I was having lunch with my son there and I had to say to him that my head was still in a spin, nearly six weeks afterwards.Why is it that a Chief Medical Officer in Scotland had to be let go, but he stays because he#s the Prime Minister#s friend  He should be let go.Reacting to Mr Cumming#s Downing Street briefing, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his behaviour had critically undermined the Government#s public health message.For all the confusion in their approach, the Stay at Home message was not complex. No one could reasonably interpret that as giving a green light to travelling hundreds of miles to Durham and then travelling further to a beauty spot to test your eyesight, he said.This is now a test of this Conservative government. They have a simple question to answer - what is more important, saving Dominic Cummings job or saving lives  There is only one answer.He added that those separated from friends and family needed certainty their sacrices had not been made in vain.

The whole reason we did it was to take our minds off it and give us ourselves a challenge, so it definitely helped us to not feel down in the dumps about the day that should have been.Starting at am, the -hour endurance feat took place on a treadmill outside, with stormy conditions adding to the challenge.It hit me on Thursday night that I should have been with my mates getting ready for the big day, he said.But we have it lined up for next year and it will be bigger and better, so we#re trying to stay positive.After volunteering to work at the Nightingale hospital in Belfast City Hospital, Amy is now back on the cardiac ward at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Adam said it was a nervous time for the family with uncertainty over how the NHS would cope.At the start it was the big unknown and everyone was panic-stations thinking they were going to be unprepared, said the former Ballinamallard United target man. We were really worried about front line NHS staff, but thankfully they#ve not been overwhelmed and we#re hoping there won#t be a second wave. It could very easily have gone the other way.On putting off moving into their first home together, he said it was just another inconvenience that many more were facing.There#s not a person that hasn#t been affected, with weddings, houses or holidays missed. So there#s nothing you can really do but accept it and wait.While missing his sporting le, Adam - whose side had reached the Irish Cup semi-finals - said he does not foresee ato competing any time soon.I think the Irish League will have to make a decision on playing games soon but I really don#t see how it#s financially viable, based on the league that is, he said.Obviously the English and Spanish leagues are set tosoon but they#re heavily financed by television revenue.The Irish League haven#t got that, so a lot of clubs would rely on the gate receipts with people coming to watch the games.If it does come back, it will be on a sort of half-cooked measure with restrictions on gates.I don#t see how clubs could afford to bring players back, and you would have to do testing as well, which will be costly.I really don#t envy whoever has to make the decision as there#s bound to be people upset and all sorts of fallout from it.It#s crazy times. As a player you really miss it, but I didn#t realise how much you miss the sport and the whole team environment until you don#t have it.Speaking personally, I would love to be back soon as I can but I don#t want to risk anybody#s safety.For more information about the fundraising campaign, visit uk.virginmoneygiving AmyEdgar  Belfast   Most ReadCoronavirus: Northern Ireland retail shops to get go-ahead to reopen soonCoronavirus: PSNI forced to close roads as hundreds of day trippers drive up to the north coastCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Dominic Cummings defends allegations he broke lockdown rules with Durham tripBombardier praises #incredible work# of fire service following major blaze at east Belfast siteHorror as pet is mauled to death by bull terrier in Co Down park,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But a second wave of Covid- in the autumn could disrupt these plans. Mr Donnelly said: If we ended up in a second lockdown, I don#t see how grammar schools could use academic selection to choose pupils for the following year.Teachers have been asked to predict grades for cancelled GCSE and A-level exams but it would be disastrous to do this for the transfer test. So much rests on the grade awarded.It would be unacceptable to ask a teacher to make a call as to whether a child gets into a grammar school or not. It would put immense pressure on teachers. It would poison our relationships with pupils and parents, and it would open the door to litigation.Peter Weir needs to make a clear statement reassuring primary school teachers that we will not be asked to project grades.Last year more than , pupils sat transfer tests which are used by the vast majority of grammar schools here to select pupils.Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People Koulla Yiasouma and head of the Catholic Church in Ireland Archbishop Eamon Martin have called for the exams not to go ahead this year.But their appeals are likely to be ignored despite P pupils having missed so much of the school year due to the coronavirus crisis.The Education Minister last week announced a phasedto school here from late August.He said the reopening would be subject to safety and medical guidance.But Mr Donnelly urged the minister to detail the social distancing measures that would apply so that schools could start making preparations now.We need to knowwe will be adhering to the existing social distancing rule of two metres in Northern Ireland, or whether it will be reduced to the World Health Organisation#s one metre guideline, he said.That#s crucial so we can make plans as to how to ide classes. Without that knowledge, we won#t know how many kids we can actually have in each classroom.In England there has been talk of around  children in a classroom. I don#t know how you adhere to social distancing with so many in a class.The west Belfast principal added: We need clear guidance from the minister as soon as possible so we can decideit#s necessary to split our classes of up to  children into three, four or even five groups. We must be told this by next month at the latest so we can map out the way ahead.Mr Donnelly said that as smaller classes were necessary, children would not be ing to school full-time.He added: We need to knowthe department will allow schools themselves flexibility in drawing up timetables orthe minister will direct the approach taken. And what approach will that be Will Peter Weir propose splitting groups into morning and afternoon sessions or will he want children to be in school for a full day but perhaps only two days a week Mr Donnelly also urged the Education Minister to send unemployed substitute teachers into our most deprived areas to help children during the pandemic.The Executive last week announced a £m fund to assist substitute teachers during the Covid- crisis. They are now being paid without being required to work.Mr Donnelly suggested that they could be deployed in deprived areas. There is widespread concern that our poorest and most vulnerable kids are destined to be the most disadvantaged as a consequence of the pandemic, he said.It would be an innovative step for Peter Weir to use this pool of teachers to help counter the adverse impact of the enforced school closures by allocating them to schools in communities with the greatest social and economic deprivation.It would be a way of targeting work on numeracy and literacy and also offering pastoral support to those kids who need it most.In response to the issues raised by Mr Donnelly, the Department of Education said that a very wide range of issues were under consideration. The department would be working closely with the whole education sector, including school principals, to develop appropriate guidance to assist schools with planning provision, it said.

However, I want to thank those who adopted a sensible approach and followed the advice given.Officers will continue to apply their discretion, but I appeal to people to stay at home as much as possible and play their part in fighting the virus.A spokesperson for the Executive said the relaxation of measures should not encourage people to act irresponsibly.Thanks to the actions of the public, the Executive was able to ease some of the harsh restrictions people have been living with during lockdown, they said.However, ministers made it clear that the relaxation of any measure carried an element of risk and appealed to the public to continue being responsible and not endanger themselves or others.Everyone is urged to continue following the public health advice and be sensible about not travelling to spaces where it will be dficult to observe these measures, which are still critical in the fight against Covid-.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebaf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcbf-d-be-ff-daedfe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebaf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcbf-d-be-ff-daedfe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebaf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcbf-d-be-ff-daedfe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebaf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcbf-d-be-ff-daedfe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebaf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcbf-d-be-ff-daedfe_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland coronavirus death toll rises to The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland has risen to  after eight more deaths were reported by the Department of Health.Most ReadCoronavirus: Northern Ireland retail shops to get go-ahead to reopen soonCoronavirus: PSNI forced to close roads as hundreds of day trippers drive up to the north coastCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Dominic Cummings defends allegations he broke lockdown rules with Durham tripBombardier praises #incredible work# of fire service following major blaze at east Belfast siteHorror as pet is mauled to death by bull terrier in Co Down park,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Eoin has already been plotting how to put his learning from Frankfurt into another drive for the line. And, during a relaxed -minute chat, the words improve and achieve cropped up a combined total of  times. Welcome to the mindset of a winner. Michael McMullan: Tommy, I was talking to Eoin earlier about having your record officially announced and the long wait for it to be made official. Tommy Hughes: I left it all with Eoin to sort out, so I was happy enough to take a back seat and I am over the moon that this has been made official and it will be in the Guinness Book of World Records next year...its really good. googletag.cmd.push M McM: After all you have achieved in your career, where does this one sit  TH: It tops them all. Any other things I have achieved, I have achieved on my own. This is a father and son, it is above anything I have ever done. This is far better than going to the Olympics in . It is some achievement, something I never thought would ever happen or take place. M McM: Eoin, you started running later in your career, so when did you decide were going to go for this  Eoin Hughes: It was a podcast that mentioned a father and son combined , so I looked into it. I knew my Da was a decent runner and I thought we could do that … and this was before I had even ran a step. M McM: I notice you said decent... EH:I knew my Da could run : and at that time it was : or : for the combined time, so it gave me a three hour mark and felt I couldve done that back then, we wouldve broken it. But, it wasnt until I started running that I thought this isnt that easy so ithas always been in the back of mind, so when I started improving and my Da came back into running, it came back to the forefront and it was something we should aim for and should be able to beat. M McM: Was it your motivation for starting running  EH: Not to start off, but when I did, it was the factor then...to improve and try for it. M McM: What about you Tommy, did you think he was mad  TH: I definitely thought it was within our grasp and I think I cant improve. I am going over the hill and down the hill a bit. Eoin has got a lot to improve, so we can improve on the record again. If Londontakes place in October, we have a good chance of lowering it and getting a far better time, that not many people can reach for a while – to set it beyond anybody  coming along. M McM:Competition is a magical thing, isnt it  TH: Of course, I live on competition. M McM: Going back Tommy, where did running start for you  TH: I got married and moved from Lavey into Maghera and joined the local GAA cluband I had a bit of weight on and my brother in lawwas doing a bit of running for Magherafelt AC. I went out for a run with him and it ended up, as usual, a bit of a competition and I kinda beat him and thought Ill do a bit more here and I realised I was better at the running than the Gaelic football, so I dropped it and kept on improving at the running. Everything just drove from there, I got my breaks and I got obsessed with improving...like everyone does, they want to get better and it went from there. M McM: What age were you when you started the running  TH: I was  or  and I ran my first marathon when I was , in , and everything flowed into each other. That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power. If thathadnt happened, I wouldve been up there, that is one of these things. M McM: There is nothing you can do at that point, with all that preparation there has to be frustration. TH: The doctor told me I wasnt going to be there, but I was glad to be there to run in the Olympics and be an Olympian. M McM: Running had got serious a long time before that for you. When did you really start to get into it  TH: Whenever I got good at running, thats when it got serious. I have always loved sports and to find out I was good at one sport, that was it...that was serious, I put everything into the one basket. M McM: What did the training schedule look like then  TH: It was seven days a week and twice a day. Id maybe do fivein the morning and  in the evening, do a bit of hill work, speed work and I was reading running magazines, taking what I could use out of it and try to improve. M McM: Eoin, you started a bit later. When did you really start to get into it  EH: It was probably in the last couple of years, I started to get my times down. I didnt start running until I was , I was doing local races and doing okay. I ran for Northern Ireland a couple of times last year, so it is probably within the last year, I said I am getting half decent here, I am getting better and I am at that stage where knocking on the door of getting Northern Ireland bests. M McM: Is time on your side  EH: Not really, I am . A lot of the athletes would only be finishing by now, whereas I am only starting. Well see. There are a few examples of older athletes starting late and doing very well into their early s, so there is a bit of hope there, but I am no spring chicken. M McM: I suppose you are able to tap into your father for advice on training. EH: I have him there when I need him. Even at the start, when my legs were sore - “Daddy how long are my legs going to be sore for” so from the very basic stuff like that, until now, to training and what I should do. Even before we went to Frankfurt, he said I needed to get the distance into the legs so the body would know how it feels. We went out and did  miles on a nice easy run...having that advice and knowing I have it, is great. I know a lot of people would love to have that. Anytime he is at races, I am sure people are askingwhat they should be doing...I have that any time I want it. M McM: Tommy, in all your years running, what sticks out for you above the rest  TH: Eoin crossing the line in Frankfurt and me asking him did we get it  and him not fit to speak and I am waiting for the answer and him saying yeah, we got it – that was brilliant. M McM: I remember that picture of Eoin gasping and you have your hand on his back... TH: I was asking him. Thats what we set out for and when I passed him I was thinking this is falling apart and how much is Eoin going to slow down and is he going to drop out of the race altogether, so I am going to have to go as hard as I can go now to try to stay within the realms of the record, so the pressure was on. I dont mind the pressure on myself, but I crossed the line and waited for Eoin to come. I will never forget it for the rest of my le, the sensation of waiting around and when he crossed the line, I was elated. M McM: For you Eoin, were you constantly looking at your watch  EH: Dad passed me with about three miles to go. I knew how long was gone and what pace he was doing. I knew what time he was going to run, so in my head I was doing maths of what I needed to do and what I was able to do...I was struggling to get to the line. I knewI ran a seven-minute mile from there to the finish, wed break it. The maths equation gave me the incentive to get to the finish line. M McM: Surely its hard to run, never mind having to count. EH: It was helping me though and taking my mind of the pain I was in. M McM: I remember when you told me about the achievement and about how you were going to beat it, it was the fact you said you would do it easily that jumped out at me. Do you need that as a goal, or is it something you firmly believe  EH: It is something we believe. I should be capable of running  minutes quicker and evenI run five minutes quicker, thats five minutes. I learned a lot from Frankfurt, it was my first go at a marathon and mistakes were made. Give me the next one and I will learn from them. M McM: What sort of mistakes do you mean, was it going too fast too early  EH: One of the biggest mistakes was being dependent on my own drinks. My Da said to me before the race it wasnt a good idea. We were sub elite, so I had all my personal drinks set out on the table. The elite, there was four bottles per table, but sub elite there was maybe a  bottles on a big long table and trying to get your drink, while running fast past it, that was a nightmare. It played on my mind that I missed bottles, so I will not do that again. I need to get more miles in the legs, so it is those things I need to improve on and will. M McM: Do you just colour code your bottle  EH: Some people had long sticks with flags on them to make them stand out, but my bottle was pretty basic. M McM: Is it now a case of waiting for the pandemic to end and seethe London marathon, or any of others will take place  You said that you couldnt focus fully until you got the date. EH: Once we have a certain marathon , we can put a good training block together. At the minute, for me, it is about building back as I had took a bit of time off. I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

The Song of the Ungirt RunnersBYCHARLES HAMILTON SORLEY We swing ungirded hips,And lightened are our eyes,The rain is on our lips,We do not run for prize.We know not whom we trustNor whitherward we fare,But we run because we mustThrough the great wide air. The waters of the seasAre troubled as by storm.The tempest strips the treesAnd does not leave them warm.Does the tearing tempest pause Do the tree-tops ask it why So we run without a causeNeath the big bare sky. The rain is on our lips,We do not run for prize.But the storm the water whipsAnd the wave howls to the skies.The winds arise and strike itAnd scatter it like sand,And we run because we like itThrough the broad bright land.

Last week, his father Sean Johnston and mother Karen Doherty were overjoyed to celebrate their son’s first birthday at home in Derry. Midway through Karen’s pregnancy it was discovered that her unborn baby had Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia or CDH for short. It is a rare potentially fatal abnormality which occurs in approximately  in , births and accounts for around % of all major congenital abnormalities. In these uncommon cases, unborn babies develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. googletag.cmd.push The past year has been challenging, a journey of ups and downs as Milo recovered from a le-saving operation and overcame bronchitis on several occasions. While researching and doing everything to ensure their unborn child had the best possible chance of survival, the couple also had to devote time to care for their other much-loved boys Ethanand Jake . Milo’s condition was first detected at Karen’s -week scan when they were told that his stomach had been pushed up to his chest cavity and his heart was on the wrong side. A consultant was able to diagnose CDH but it still had to be confirmed by a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The couple were given news that no expecting parent wants to hear, that their unborn child had a % chance of survival. It came as a hammer blow and that day was a complete blur. Sean said: “We were in shock, you just don’t know what to do. We wanted to know what happens next.” Making it to full-term was far from certain. Travelling to Belfast for scans became the norm but they remained positive. At  weeks a lung-to-head ratio was measured to determine a prognosis. There hopes were diminished. Karen was admitted to hospital early, May . The baby’s due date was May  but leaving it any later would have worsened his chances of survival. Milo would need an intensive care bed immediately after he was born, there were none available at time of admission which raised concerns that Karen may have to be transferred to a hospital in Dublin or even England. Fortunately, a bed was free just in time. Sean explained: “Doctors said that when he is born he will be the sickest child in Northern Ireland at that time until we get him stabilised. “They don’t know what complications are there until he’s born, does his heart work,he can breathe orhe can’t oranything  works. “They didn’t want Milo to cry when he came out because that allows air into his lungs, which puts more compression on them and is more damaging, but he did.” AMAZING STAFF  A ventilator was set-up and numerous doctors awaited his arrival. The couple paid tribute to all staff but in particular consultant paediatrician, Dr Sweet, who was ‘amazing’. “He kept us positive and assured us he’d do everything in his power to keep him here, ‘as long as he’s willing to help me he’ll survive’,” Sean said. “He couldn’t make any promises but said, ‘as long as he’s strong enough I’m not going to give up on him no matter how long he stays here with us’.” As the senior consultant on call that day, Dr Sweet delivered the baby at .pm. The baby was immediately whisked away to be placed in an incubator and ventilator and they didn’t see him again until pm that night. “It was the longest time of our lives,” Sean recalled. “You keep checking to seethere’s any word back. We heard back once in that time that they were still trying to stabilise him. “We were taken to see him while he was hooked up to a ventilator with lines in his ankles, in his bellybutton, on his wrists. He was on mountains of medication for his heart, blood pressure, fentanyl for pain relief amongst other things.” BAPTISM  The baby’s grandparents got a chance to see him and they were driving home to Derry when Karen and Sean were told that he may not make it through the night. A baptism was quickly arranged and their parents were phoned to come back for the service. Names had been discussed, Milo being shortlisted. But asit was a sign from God, a Belfast priest called Father Milo performed the service, their minds were made up. A short time later doctors told them Milo wasn’t reacting to the treatment and there was nothing more they could do for him. Karen and Sean stayed by his side through the night. When morning came Dr Sweet started his sht and vowed to do all he could. Treatments were adjusted and the couple were told to take short period of respite with the assurance that the baby would be kept aliveanything went wrong. Around  minutes later they were greeted with words they longed to hear, ‘good news’. Milo was stable, he was off adrenaline and steroids, and his ventilation had been changed. However, a le-saving surgery was still needed to close the hole in his diaphragm during which he lost a lot of blood and required a transfusion. It was discovered that all of his organs except his liver had moved into the chest cavity,the liver had then Milo would’ve died. He kept fighting post-surgery and showed signs of improvement. SPECIAL  Peace of mind was restored on that fateful day. To the astonishment, and delight of his parents, Milo was discharged from hospital at age  and a half weeks. A setback came ten days later when he was readmitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital with a potentially fatal bowel obstruction where he spent a further two weeks. Back home in Derry Milo remained susceptible to infection and has been in and out of Altnagelvin with bronchitis. It has not been plain sailing but they have watched their baby make gradual improvements and are filled with hope about the future. Doctors have been stunned at his level of progression. The charity CDH UK has also been a great support to the family throughout. The emergence of Coronavirus means that Milo has to be isolated and protected at home but thankfully there are no concerns at the moment. May  was the pinnacle of a tough year, a beautul moment for all the family as Milo reached his first birthday, a milestone that seemed unreachable just twelve months ago. “This was a massive moment for us,” Sean said, “knowing everything we’ve been through to get there. “We thought back to the same time last year when he was in intensive care and what he’s overcome - it made it all the more special.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Local charity volunteer Debbie Lamberton from Creggan has been writing since she was at school. Ive always done it over theyears topass the time she said. It keeps the brain active. I couldrhyme a poem off in a few minutes and other times I could sit for two or three days looking for a word that rhymes. I wont change the line until I get the right word. Debbies love of poetry blossomed in recentyears after she lost a number of loved ones to suicide. googletag.cmd.push I started really writing due to tragedy, she said. I lost a few people to the Foyle and I wrote a poem about it A River of Tears which people really connected with. That is my favourite poem and one that resonates this week because of Mental Health Awareness Week. Although some of her poetry deals with dficult themes, many of the pieces have a thread of humour running through them. Theres a sensehumourin Creggan, said Debbie. I write about things that everyone goes through and that everyone relates to and I put in it words that people relate to. googletag.cmd.push Theres no pointin me sitting here writing out a poem with big snobby words People will say shes from Creggan, who does she think she is, Shakespere  Poems like Lockdown make light of a bad situation because the one thing we do have is our humour. It doesnt mention the NHS though, so Id like todo something on that next. And Id also like to do a poem for our postmen because they are as much frontline workers as anyone. Debbie shares her poetry on Facebook and has been approached in the past about publishing a collection of her work. If I write something and someone relates to it then thats great, she said, If it lts someones spirits thats enoughfor me really. If I ever did write a book I would do it for charity because then it would combine two things that I love doing- fundraising and poetry. I also love to encourage other writers. I love to see people do well and Im a big believer thatyou can compliment someone then you should and it will come back to you in some way. ------------------ Lockdown - by Debbie Lamberton Well never forget about LockdownWhere we baked cakes and scones In our homesDanced through Tic Toc videos and musicPlanted flowers, and bought garden gnomes.Entertainment was there in abundance.Our local singers visited all of our streetsThe Easter bunny also made an appearanceWaving to kids with some chocolate and treats.Everyone pulled together making sure no-one was lonely.Birthdays were treated with drive bys and balloons.Personally trainers went live with their sessions.Where you could train in your own living room.Sadly funerals where sadder than everOnly small numbers were allowed to attendSome families could not be with their loved onesNo goodbyes when that le came to an end.This has been a challenge for all of us out thereWe should be proud that weve made it this farRaise your glass to those who sadly arent with us.To those who still battle throughout this corona war.

Local charity volunteer Debbie Lamberton from Creggan has been writing since she was at school. Ive always done it over theyears topass the time she said. It keeps the brain active. I couldrhyme a poem off in a few minutes and other times I could sit for two or three days looking for a word that rhymes. I wont change the line until I get the right word. Debbies love of poetry blossomed in recentyears after she lost a number of loved ones to suicide. googletag.cmd.push I started really writing due to tragedy, she said. I lost a few people to the Foyle and I wrote a poem about it A River of Tears which people really connected with. That is my favourite poem and one that resonates this week because of Mental Health Awareness Week. Although some of her poetry deals with dficult themes, many of the pieces have a thread of humour running through them. Theres a sensehumourin Creggan, said Debbie. I write about things that everyone goes through and that everyone relates to and I put in it words that people relate to. googletag.cmd.push Theres no pointin me sitting here writing out a poem with big snobby words People will say shes from Creggan, who does she think she is, Shakespere  Poems like Lockdown make light of a bad situation because the one thing we do have is our humour. It doesnt mention the NHS though, so Id like todo something on that next. And Id also like to do a poem for our postmen because they are as much frontline workers as anyone. Debbie shares her poetry on Facebook and has been approached in the past about publishing a collection of her work. If I write something and someone relates to it then thats great, she said, If it lts someones spirits thats enoughfor me really. If I ever did write a book I would do it for charity because then it would combine two things that I love doing- fundraising and poetry. I also love to encourage other writers. I love to see people do well and Im a big believer thatyou can compliment someone then you should and it will come back to you in some way. ------------------ Lockdown - by Debbie Lamberton Well never forget about LockdownWhere we baked cakes and scones In our homesDanced through Tic Toc videos and musicPlanted flowers, and bought garden gnomes.Entertainment was there in abundance.Our local singers visited all of our streetsThe Easter bunny also made an appearanceWaving to kids with some chocolate and treats.Everyone pulled together making sure no-one was lonely.Birthdays were treated with drive bys and balloons.Personally trainers went live with their sessions.Where you could train in your own living room.Sadly funerals where sadder than everOnly small numbers were allowed to attendSome families could not be with their loved onesNo goodbyes when that le came to an end.This has been a challenge for all of us out thereWe should be proud that weve made it this farRaise your glass to those who sadly arent with us.To those who still battle throughout this corona war.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. The organisation has been awarded a Project Viability Grant by the Architectural Heritage Fund to help them explore uses which could revive and sustain the historically signicant and challenging building. googletag.cmd.push Speaking earlier this year when the new organisation was launched, Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon.

Pints of Guinness had been wrapped in cling film for delivery purposes. At the time a spokesman for the pub complained gardaiacute were unable to tell him what laws staff had broken. Now, it has emerged that after the legal advice received in recent days, such deliveries will be possible once the drinks are paid for in advance to a person on a pub’s premises. googletag.cmd.push For the full articleSEE HERE   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In recent years, plans have been put forward to demolish the current sports centre and replace it with a state-of-the-art leisure facility. It has been estimated that such a project could cost around poundm A major consultation process was carried out on the plans for the site. At the beginning of this year, Derry City and Strabane District Council said that it was working on the development of a funding and financing strategy for the Templemore plans. However, in light of the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the councils finances, there are concerns over what will now happen with the Templemore project. googletag.cmd.push The local council recently revealed that it is facing an estimated loss of pound.m this financial year because of the pandemic. The Templemore project will be discussed at Thursdays monthly meeting of the council when a motion will be put forward by Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon. Cllr Mellons motion states that the council notes the public disappointment at the lack of progress to date to advance the construction and re-development of Templemore Sports Complex and Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane. The motions states: “This motion calls on Council to prioritise the development of those long outstanding projects by bringing forward a report to the Council meeting in September to include the identication of all funding options available and a timetable towards completion so that the Council can consider its options.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane. Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title. It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title.  – Daryl McDermott Big ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts. He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out. He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts. He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember. Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly A constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year. He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following. In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup. Quiet and does his talking on the pitch.  – Sean Cassidy Has been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade. Has played a wing back and full back. He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence - all done with a smile on his face. Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. googletag.cmd.push  – Karl McKaigue Karl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming. An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart. Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better. He can also dodge forward to pick off a score.  – Mark Craig Mark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point. Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling.  – Brian Oacuteg McGilligan Brian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch. He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg Hinphey One of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career. He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting. One of the greats.  - Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated club hurler of a decade. Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in . He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland. He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match.  – Gerald Bradley You dont miss anything until its gone. Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch. He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit. His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say. Awesome.  – Kevin Hinphey Joins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team. A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions. Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season. Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team. - Cormac ODoherty He was born to play hurling. Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home. Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness. Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart. Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball. A natural.  – Paddy Henry Paddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs. It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final. He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions. He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack. He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal. He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters. Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.  - Ruairi ConveryWhen Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him. He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage. A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl.

Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane. Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title. It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title.  – Daryl McDermott Big ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts. He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out. He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts. He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember. Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly A constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year. He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following. In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup. Quiet and does his talking on the pitch.  – Sean Cassidy Has been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade. Has played a wing back and full back. He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence - all done with a smile on his face. Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. googletag.cmd.push  – Karl McKaigue Karl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming. An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart. Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better. He can also dodge forward to pick off a score.  – Mark Craig Mark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point. Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling.  – Brian Oacuteg McGilligan Brian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch. He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg Hinphey One of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career. He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting. One of the greats.  - Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated club hurler of a decade. Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in . He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland. He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match.  – Gerald Bradley You dont miss anything until its gone. Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch. He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit. His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say. Awesome.  – Kevin Hinphey Joins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team. A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions. Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season. Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team. - Cormac ODoherty He was born to play hurling. Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home. Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness. Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart. Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball. A natural.  – Paddy Henry Paddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs. It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final. He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions. He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack. He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal. He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters. Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.  - Ruairi ConveryWhen Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him. He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage. A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl.

Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry. Second was Cepu Gale with Colin Andrews third on Golden Start.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time.

It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games. We had to do all our own prep, there was a delay in starting as guests arrived late due to Storm Ciara and there was a lot of things that went wrong, like the power going off, that wasnrsquot shown, said Alex.ldquoI joked with the other two guys you can just put the effort into one dish and can make sure its absolutely perfect but Irsquove got two to doldquoThe profile of the programme and the scale of the guests and how well known they were made it feel more pressurised.Ten years ago, Alex moved on to Deanes in Belfast after the Bucks Head, where he was working when they first received the Michelin star under Derek Creagh. He later moved to work with Gordon Ramsay at Claridgersquos, followed by Petrus in London, then had a spell in New Zealand before moving closer to home to the Clf House Hotel in Waterford.There are great expectations on what Alex will do next in his career but he doesnrsquot feel that a change will happen so soon considering the impact of the coronavirus lockdown has had on restaurants.ldquoA lot of people have said to me that I should open my own restaurant, but the industry is in dire straits at the moment so itrsquos hard to know what will happen, said Alex. ldquoOf course, I have ideas of what I would like to do, but Michael gives me a  for what I want to do which I appreciate.

No commercial waste is being accepted.Ratepayers are being asked to pre-sort waste before entering the recycling sites and no wood, bulky items of household waste such as old furniture, mattresses or electrical goods will be accepted at this time.Council officials say that only one person per vehicle should travel to the site, appealing to people queueing to get in to the local facilities to remain in their vehicles.Only cars, small vans and trailers with small loads will be allowed to use the sites, with access for vans restricted to those no more than .m high. No large vehicles, horse boxes, tractors or small tipper trucks will be allowed on any of the sites.In addition, visitors must practice social distancing, maintaining a two metre distance from staff and other visitors on site, use hand sanitiser and take direction from centre staff. Any visitors who refuse to follow staff instruction may be asked to leave.Council officials insist that they are continually reviewing the centresrsquo opening hours in light of rapidly changing events and may have to make further changes at very short notice.They have appealed to the public to only visit the centres where it is absolutely necessary, keeping heavier and bulkier items at home. Small loads will only be accepted.Council chairman Charlie Casey urged the public be patient and respect staff as the operation of the restricted service gets underway.He continued: ldquoThe council does anticipate that there may be signicant demand in the first few days and that members of the public may be asked to leave and come back on another day.ldquoPlease treat household recycling centre staff with respect and consideration during this challenging period. Thank you for your continued cooperation in helping keep the district safe and clean.Up until this week, only Mid and East Antrim, Antrim and Newtownabbey and Causeway Coast and Glens were the only councils which had opened their recycling facilities following guidance issued by Stormont environment minister, Edwin poots.A number of ratepayers in the Saintfield area had expressed concern that while the recycling centres in Down District remained closed, one in nearby Carryduff was open.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-. Trust officials say the deferred payment has been agreed by regional trade unions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

These changes are becoming more apparent when extreme weather events increase and sea levels rise.ldquoUsing ground-based survey technology, we can study relatively rapid changes in the movements of beach sands on this site.ldquoResearch to date has shown the once golden beach at the promenade at Newcastle have over the past few decades been pushed down the coast toward Ballykinlar through wave and tidal action.ldquoWith increased storm events we are studying how this may present itself in the near future.Professor Jackson added: ldquoAs well as past and present movements, we are examining future scenarios of how heightened sea levels at the site will alter the coastline dynamics.ldquoWe are using Murlough Bay as a test bed for establishing coastal monitoring protocols for other sites in the region. These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

It’s why I’m not ‘angry’ at, or with nationalism.I have previously acknowledged the important and necessary work done by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and SDLP in trying to fashion political societal institutions in which we could all have a sense of ownership and while I accepted that the aspirations for a united Ireland would never disappear, I did arguethat genuine equality of citizenship would help to dampen those aspirations and build a Northern Ireland which would have the support of a cross-community majority.That Sinn Fein continues to prioritise unity over every option is no surprise to me. Indeed, my opening line last week was, ‘Sinn Fein is doing what Sinn Fein has always done playing its own cards in its own time.’ Later, I noted: ‘While politics is now the preferred way of doing business, the willingness to dump policies and strategieshas always been there. It was a long journey – with Gerry Adams as the guiding strategist for most of the time – but the sht from outright terror to ballot box and armalite to fighting elections and taking seats to peace talks to the ceasefires and ending of the ‘armed struggle’ to co-governing with unionists in Stormont to serving as deputy with a unionist first minister to shaking hands with the Queen et al has all been part of the same ‘unity project’.’  with David Trimble and John Hume during the campaign for a Yes vote in .

I used it – and very specically so – in reference to Sinn Fein and the IRA and certain things that happened during the ‘long journey’ I mentioned above. No other nationalist party was mentioned in the column. No condemnation of rights or reforms was mentioned. This was about issues which I viewed as being asked for by and then delivered for Sinn Fein and for Sinn Fein alone. Anyway, I was asked for ‘three or four examples of this serial appeasement since the early s’. In July  the British government opened its first formal back-channel links with the Provisional IRA and began what became a decades-long dialogue on what was required from the government for the IRA to end its terror campaign. Those back-channels were never closed, leaving the very clear impression within both Sinn Fein and the IRA that eventual deals were possible even while the terror campaign continued. Crucially, the assumption, on both sides, must have been that any deal would be broadly acceptable to the joint leadership of SF and the IRA.In  the introduction of the ballot box armalite strategywas the clearest possible signal that the IRA intended to continue the terror campaign while Sinn Fein increasingly tested the electoral waters. That should have been enough for any British government to close down the back-channels and insist that, in the absence of an unambiguous sht to democracy only, then all links between SF IRA, the government and the intelligence services would end with the government prioritising a military response. But again the impression was conveyed that keeping Sinn Fein on board was more important to the government than any other option.In February  the IRA ended its ceasefire with a massive bomb in the Docklands in London. In July  the ceasefire was reinstated and Sinn Fein wasgiven the green light by Tony Blair toto the talks process without any commitment on the decommissioning issue. The other parties in the process were, to all intents and purposes, presented with a fait accompli: accept Sinn Fein’sor see the entire process collapse. Keeping Sinn Fein on board was, yet again, deemed more important than anything .On-the-run letters were given the OK by the government because it was an issue of importance to Sinn Fein alone.In  it was confirmed that the Army Council was still in existence and continuing an overarching input into Sinn Fein, the political structures north and south and the IRA itself. Despite concerns from the other parties the issue was brushed off by the government.I would define all of these as appeasements because they were done to keep Sinn Fein and the IRA within the process, irrespective of the anger and impact of and within the other parties. Others would add the early release of prisoners to the list, but I viewed that as more a concession to all of the paramilitaries, aimed at securing a collective buy-in to a peace process and agreement. A number of other decisions made during the run-up to the  agreement, while uncomfortable for key playerson both sides, could also be regarded as collective concessions.The other point I made in last week’s column was that what I’m defining as appeasementsraises serious, dficult and ongoing questions about how successive Britishgovernments viewed and continue to view Sinn Fein. As one veteran unionist put it to me last week: “Nothing changes. What Sinn Fein wants Sinn Fein gets. To be honest, you can’t really blame them for their never-ending demands – it’s a policy that seems to work for them.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One,

put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last

NorthernIreland’s  councils by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd PartyCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey MLA said: “Despite the current COVID- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in deliveringpublic services, such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be required to ensure that Council are not only in a position to provide continuity of service to our ratepayers but that we are able to help our communities recover,” said the Lord Mayor.“The executive must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council will continue to ensure vital public services are protected.“Council welcomes the announcement by Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, and will continue to work with the Minister, and colleagues across councils, to make the case for support of local government to ensure vital public services are protected,” said the spokesperson.Adam Morton , Local Democracy
