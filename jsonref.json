The regulator has the power to block the investment completely or to demand specific remedies from the companies.The CMA said the deal could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower-quality services. Amazon and Deliveroo had been given five days from 11 December to come up with changes, but did not offer anything. The CMA says it will conclude its investigate by 11 June 2020.One of the main concerns was the impact on the incipient ultra-fast grocery delivery market. In the UK Deliveroo has been working on grocery deliveries within two hours for Morrisons and the Co-op, going up against Amazon’s one-hour service for subscribers to its Prime service. While the sector is still relatively small, the CMA was concerned that an effective merger between two firms could erode competition.Amazon has previously tried to enter the food delivery market. In 2016 it unveiled Amazon Restaurants, which was initially available to some Londoners as part of its Prime subscription service. However, the service was closed in December 2018, a testament to the difficult economics of delivering hot food at low cost.The CMA’s investigation represents a rare regulatory rebuke to Amazon. The $926bn company, founded by Jeff Bezos, has built up commanding positions globally in online retail and cloud computing with relatively few regulatory hurdles.However, its size and use of offshore jurisdictions to minimise tax payments have increasingly attracted the attention of politicians across the world. The US Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for Amazon, and other online platforms such as Google and Facebook, to be broken up.In the UK Boris Johnson last month said internet companies needed to make a “fairer contribution” on tax, although trade experts have questioned whether his government will push ahead with a levy that could anger the US ahead of crucial post-Brexit trade talks.Deliveroo, which was founded by the former investment banker Will Shu, has raised a total of $1.5bn since it launched in 2013.It is understood the CMA will publish an issues statement, setting out in detail what it expects to investigate, in the coming weeks.A spokesperson for Deliveroo said: “Deliveroo has been working closely with the CMA and will continue to do so. We are confident that we will persuade the CMA of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers.“Deliveroo is a British company operating right across the country and this investment will be particularly beneficial to the UK economy.”An Amazon spokesperson said: “A homegrown UK business like Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters. Amazon believes that this investment funding will lead to more pro-consumer innovation by helping Deliveroo continue to build its world-class service and remain competitive in the restaurant food delivery space by creating more highly skilled jobs, innovating in the restaurant food delivery sector, and developing new products for customers.” • Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/775be1aae9e015c5793ef93971cd3f44cb97a304/6_0_1908_1145/master/1908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ba355016ee8309e88b88476b6cc5bec","title":"how has brexit vote affected uk economy december verdict","story":"Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has had on growth, prosperity and trade•UK economy faces weakest growth outside recession since second world war•Shadow of Brexit still looms over economy.

The shortfall between the value of goods and services sold abroad and imported to the UK increased by about £3bn on the previous month to reach £14.5bn in October, amid a surge in imports before the Halloween deadline. The trade in goods deficit, excluding services, rose from £1.9bn in September to £5.2bn, above the consensus estimate of City economists for an increase to £3bn. Analysts said that underlying demand for UK exports remained depressed by the uncertainty over Brexit, with some overseas companies shunning the UK, given the lack of clarity over the future trading relationship with the EU.House prices across Britain dropped by the most in November for seven months, in a sign that Brexit and election uncertainty was weighing on the minds of buyers and sellers, a closely watched barometer of the property market showed. The gauge from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors – which shows the difference between its members reporting price rises and falls – declined to -12 in November from -5 a month earlier, missing the forecasts of City economists. The UK housing market has cooled since the Brexit vote, with prices falling on an annual basis in London and some surrounding areas. Prices have continued to rise in the Midlands and the north of England.Brexit and austerity were the two major factors framing the 2019 election. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, day-to-day public spending on services was set to rise to above 2010 levels regardless of which party won the election, in a sign of a growing political consensus on the need to end the past decade of austerity. However, it found that day-to-day spending – excluding health – would not return to above its 2010 peak, warning that austerity was essentially still “baked in” to the new government’s plans. The country’s leading tax and spending thinktank said that neither Labour’s nor the Conservatives’ plans were credible, as they reinforced a message that spending could rise without tax-raising measures to pay for them. It warned that the Tories promising to exit the transition period at the end of 2020 with or without a trade deal with the EU could damage the public finances and the UK economy.

Since 2016, that has changedThe world has traditionally looked enviously at the solidity of UK institutions: a politically impartial civil service, an effective parliament, an independent judiciary, a pragmatic constitutional settlement and ultimately the United Kingdom itself. But for how much longer? The Brexit vote and the years of uncertainty that have followed have gnawed at the foundations of each of these.The first pillar to suffer was the civil service. It has always prided itself on its ability to serve governments of any persuasion – in contrast to many other countries. Whereas the US has a top layer of political appointees, German state secretaries are installed on the basis of political sympathies and Australian and Canadian ministers are cocooned by political advisers, the UK has people whose careers flourish under all shades of minister.Initially, at least, Brexit was a boon: it led to a significant increase in staff, and more opportunities for promotion. The service got loads done. It made sure that the statute book was more or less ready for a no-deal exit new systems and processes were developed and are being delivered, and a massive withdrawal agreement was negotiated and then renegotiated.But Brexit also exposed its limitations and undermined trust. It became clear that the civil service lacked a deep understanding of the extent to which the UK was intertwined with the EU and how this interacted with devolution and the delicate balance in Northern Ireland. It also found itself under an unforgiving political spotlight.Its reputation for impartiality had already been compromised by George Osborne’s handling of the Treasury’s post-Brexit forecast, which suggested a severe economic shock the day after the referendum, and led him to threaten an apocalyptic emergency budget. Government analysts have yet to recover from the credibility this lost them in the eyes of Brexit supporters.The May government closed its ears to anyone with EU expertise or experience who warned that the EU would not rush to do a special deal for the UK. As they were ignored internally, there was a Twitter chorus of criticism from ex-officials that seemed to confirm a collective hostility.But the bigger problem was the inability of the May government, so riven by internal isions, to act decisively. The civil service abhors a vacuum, and the absence of effective leadership pushed people such as the UK’s chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, into the firing line – and he, rather than the prime minister, was seen as the architect of her reviled deal. In that respect, at least, a more decisive Johnson government is likely to be much easier to work with.But passing the withdrawal agreement won’t mean the pressure is off. Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has long had the civil service in his sights. If his reform agenda is about competence, capacity and accountability that could be good news. If it means civil servants are cowed into not challenging ministers on the implications of their plans, it will be bad. The risk is that we end up with Americanisation – with a politically appointed top layer deterring good professionals from staying. Worse still would be the Trumpification of the civil service – with key posts unfilled or filled by people who are wholly unqualified.The second pillar to be chipped away at has been the reputation of government itself – which means ministers – for basic competence. The UK was always an effective negotiator in Brussels – that was why we secured so many special deals. But since 2016 it has been unclear on both strategy and tactics. Collective cabinet responsibility went into meltdown. The May ministry displayed a talent for diplomatic ineptitude, misreading most of our European allies and assuming that its domestic political messages would not be read abroad, creating an impression of tin-earedness at best and unreliability or untrustworthiness at worst.This has been accompanied by a rocky few years for parliament. The restoration of business as usual, with a hefty majority, will put an end to the war of attrition between the legislature and executive. But the arguments over Brexit have shown parliament’s processes to be in need of a radical overhaul, to avoid the need to resort to little-known procedures at the whim of the Speaker in order to extract information from government. Johnson’s decision to remove MPs’ oversight of negotiations on the future relationship with the EU looks like a declaration of intent that he proposes to cut parliament back down to size.The courts haven’t escaped the general turbulence either. Ministers have bridled at the willingness of judges to intervene on political issues. Theresa May fought to the supreme court to prevent parliament having a say over article 50, and Boris Johnson fumed when his prorogation was coolly voided by Lady Hale and her colleagues. The judiciary came under sustained attack from the press for their allegedly partisan stance and Jacob Rees-Mogg was reported as saying the supreme court had affected a “constitutional coup”.As damaging as the sniping at judges was, the suggestion that the prime minister might play fast and loose with the rule of law, as “anonymous” No 10 sources briefed that he would not seek the extension to EU membership as required, was truly shocking.The roots of all this turmoil lie in the casual approach to constitutional matters that allowed David Cameron to legislate for a referendum as a stratagem to solve a problem within his own party. His memoir suggests that he toyed with the possibility of setting a minimum threshold leave would have to reach in order to win – if he had gone ahead with this, remain would have carried the day. Unlike other countries that use referendums more often and more wisely, the UK has an ad hoc approach to them that has meant since 2016 we have been grappling with how to reconcile representative with direct democracy, an issue finally resolved – though obviously not to everyone’s satisfaction – by the 2019 election.But Brexit and the election have brought into focus the fragility of the final pillar on which our reputation for stable government rests, the union itself. They have given the SNP a pretext to reopen the independence question, apparently settled in 2014, and have tilted opinion in Northern Ireland, making the prospect of a border poll more likely. Both nations voted to remain in 2016, but the UK system – unlike in formal federations – did not assign that any constitutional significance.Earlier this year, the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, a traditional UK ally, told the BBC’s Today programme: “With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the UK will be a different country. It will be a diminished country. It is unavoidable.” Johnson’s new year resolution, as he looks forward to perhaps a decade in power, should be to make sure Rutte is not proved right.• Jill Rutter is a senior research fellow at UK in a Changing Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53dfa8f2e1dffa79333178df2fcfe7fd6083a506/0_44_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9e44d3b748352f51e2cf45f2774d118","title":"brexit end english official eu language uk brussels","story":"Now that we know that Boris Johnson will “get Brexit done” by the end of January 2020, what are the implications for English as an official language of the European Union and in the European parliament? Could it stop being used when Britain leaves?In 2016 Danuta Hübner, an MEP and chair of the European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee, was quoted as saying, “If we don’t have the UK, we don’t have English.” But is it as simple as that?Until the 1990s, the dominant language of the EU was French. When the EU was the EC (European Community) and the official language policy was defined, Dutch, French, German and Italian were identified as the working languages. However, as more countries joined, many of which had English as a second or additional language, the number of English speakers grew until English became the majority common language.Currently, the EU lists 24 official and working languages. The UK is the only member country that gives English as its official language. There are a few member countries that commonly use English but have nominated a different language as their EU official language. For instance, the Republic of Ireland gives Irish Gaelic as its official language, and Malta gives Maltese.When Britain withdraws from the EU (and leaving aside possible negotiations with Scotland or other territories), in order to remove English as an official language, as clarified in a statement on behalf of the European commission in Ireland dated 27 June 2016, there would have to be a unanimous vote in the European parliament in favour of doing so. Speaking at the time of the referendum, in 2016, the German EU commissioner Günther Oettinger explained, “We have a series of member states that speak English, and English is the world language which we all accept.” So, even if there was the will to do so, getting rid of English wouldn’t be straightfoward.Even if it did come to that, would it be a knock-down blow for the language? Historically, English has weathered a number of storms. When colonies of the British empire sought to gain their independence, it may have seemed logical for English – the language of the oppressors – to be rejected at the same time. The fact that this did not happen, and that English is used as an official first or second language in more than 70 countries worldwide, points in part to its developing socioeconomic and political status during the 20th century. The number of speakers for whom English is an unofficial second or foreign language is greater than all other English language speakers, and continues to grow. With the decline of the British empire came the rise of the United States, which has English as its official language. Prof Lynne Murphy from the University of Sussex believes the US saved the English language. From the perspective of its use as a global lingua franca, she has got a point.In fact, in some postcolonial situations, English is regarded as a more or less neutral language. In India, for example, English was supposed to be phased out post-independence in 1947 in favour of Hindi. However, as not everyone in India speaks Hindi, and many do not want to for various cultural and political reasons, English continued to be used, and is now an official language of India. In Hong Kong, English is still an official language despite the return of the territory to the People’s Republic of China in 1997. As Hong Kong is an international hub for trade and finance, this makes pragmatic sense, but there is also evidence that Hong Kong people feel that the English language is part of their identity – something that makes Hong Kong distinctive from mainland China. Singapore has speakers of Malay, Chinese (various dialects) and Tamil, among others in this context, English is a unifying language.But these Englishes are not “British English”, or even “American English”. The Englishes spoken around the world have developed their own vocabulary and grammar Euro-English is no exception. English simply does not belong to traditional “native” English speakers any more: it belongs to everyone who speaks it, and it will develop and change depending on the communicative needs of speech communities. Brits and Americans need to bear this in mind when using English in international settings, as they cannot assume they will be understood by every English speaker.So, will English cease to be a language of the EU? Probably not in the short to medium term, either in conversations between EU member countries, MEPs, or in EU interaction with other countries around the world. One Swedish MEP even suggested that communications in the EU could be fairer in English, as it will be everyone’s second language. In the long term, however, the continued dominance of English as a global language may depend on its political and socioeconomic fortunes. As it is so well-established and widespread, I believe it is likely to be used as a global lingua franca for some time. But situations and languages change. I think it was Andy Hamilton who pointed out that, once Latin was everyone’s second language, it was no longer anyone’s first.• Jane Setter is professor of phonetics at the University of Reading"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1314024538f8449ff732e089df245236ec060c/256_0_5587_3353/master/5587.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a4a8f497746fa4667242ab757f3010a","title":"britain churches cathedrals anglican","story":"While parish church attendance continues to fall, cathedrals are becoming much-needed cultural and therapeutic hubsAs a church-lover but not church-goer, I despair at the looming presence in the centre of almost every city, town and village of what the radical bishop of Worcester, John Inge, deplores as “locked mausoleums marginal to the lives of their communities”. A quarter of the 15,000 Anglican parish churches now have fewer than 16 worshippers, with a large and historic building at their disposal left empty six days a week. That building was paid for by the tithes of local people. The government rightly prevents it from being demolished, as embodying local identity, memory and craftsmanship. The prospect is of these churches going the way of medieval castles, to become barricaded vacant ruins, as Philip Larkin wrote, “A shape less recognisable each week  A purpose more obscure.”I cannot believe they are beyond reuse. One avenue might be termed traditional. It lies in a recent survey of GPs who complained that they were becoming “the new clergy”. Ever more people have no symptoms beyond loneliness and despair. They say, “Doctor, I’m not sure there is any point to all this.” Doctors dare not prescribe churchgoing even for devout patients, though I am told some do have a priest on call. One practice in Cumbria is even a joint vicar’sdoctor’s surgery: “The vicar will see you now.” I once visited a council estate in Leeds, where the vicar told me he was the last professional person living anywhere nearby. Teachers, doctors, social workers, police officers had all fled. His door was an all-purpose port of call for those in distress. He was alone on the frontline where the welfare state was in retreat, his priestly duty of dispensing comfort and support overlapping with that of the therapist and care-worker. For many people, there must be some complementarity between faith and healing. One thing to be said for the established church is that, unlike much of social care, it has not all but given up.Another clue lies in the experience of cathedrals. Sanctity as such is clearly no barrier to popularity. While a few, such as Peterborough and Guildford, are in financial trouble, most English cathedrals are doing fine. Everywhere they offer catering, shopping and a performance stage. There has been golf at Rochester, skateboarding at Gloucester, a helter-skelter at Norwich. Liverpool is never still. St Albans is the cultural focus of its city.Somehow, cathedrals have contrived to snap free of the sectarian exclusivity of the parish church. They answer to a longing for congregation and communal space. Their key is a quality unfashionable to social analysis, the offer of solitude with beauty. You need not to be of faith to sit quietly and contemplate the loveliness of a cathedral. As a dean once hinted to me in a whisper, “Here we don’t bang on about God.” The sociologist Grace Davie described a cathedral as “vicarious religion”, somewhere an inidual can be private, undisturbed and uplifted by architecture and music. To Davie cathedrals catered to “a desire for anonymity, the option to come and go without explanation or commitment”. They are psychotherapy in glass and stone.This quality of therapy through meditating beauty should apply to most churches. But like cathedrals they need to offer more than that. As shopping streets collapse and village and town centres decline, many churches will be the last place of congregation left standing. Some are already branching out as concert halls, meeting rooms, coffee shops, schoolrooms, even post offices, though desperately few. None to the best of my knowledge is a pub.There is no reason beyond determination – and over-rigid planning – why churches should not revert to what they were in the middle ages: one-stop shops for every local service, for advice, therapy, support and company for those in need. This applies especially in rural areas, whose residents are increasingly elderly.I am familiar with the objections. The Church of England must hold a world record for institutional negativity. That is why these buildings must be freed from their present “nationalisation”, and move into the control of parochial councils, trusts or social enterprises, as in Germany and Scandinavia, where they can levy an (optional) local church tax. They must have a primarily secular future.There will always be churches. Those who want them for worship need not fear. Reviving in them a sense of both wonder and purpose might even lead some people from Christmas back to God."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6105aab575f6535f80f785c47b00a90ccab7b6e/0_196_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b9e82ecc3e00c3e54feec1e96dc18ff","title":"compare corbyn labour michael foot neil kinnock","story":"After the disaster of the general election, Labour figures of a certain age started pointedly sharing on social media a video of a conference speech. It is of course Neil Kinnock, in 1985, attacking the “rigid dogma” leading to the “grotesque chaos” of Liverpool’s Labour council, then under the heavy influence of the Trotskyist Militant tendency. The implication didn’t even need to be stated: this is what needs to happen now. A centrist leader such as Kinnock is going to purge you Trots, tack back to the centre and then win an election … in 12 years.It’s history repeating itself, they say. An ineffectual pacifist who didn’t genuflect enough to patriotism – Michael Foot then, Jeremy Corbyn now – led the party to oblivion, and allowed in a horde of far-left “entryists”, who brought the party into disrepute. But who are the entryists today, and who should be purged? The first to name names is a Corbyn-sympathetic figure, Paul Mason, who has already argued that Corbyn staffers Andrew Murray and Seumas Milne are “Stalinists” who must be forced out. “Stalinists” is generally shorthand for ageing trade unionists unable to get with the times with the same ease as ex-Trotskyists such as Mason.But isn’t Momentum just like Militant, you may ask? The latter was a tightly organised Leninist party: a small sect based mainly in Merseyside that collectively joined Labour almost unnoticed in the early 60s it took 20 years for it to control the party’s youth wing, take over several constituency Labour parties and elect three MPs. Following Kinnock’s mass expulsions, Militant had a major role in the campaign against the poll tax, but after its abolition disappeared back into the margins.It’s hard to imagine a more different beast to Momentum – a massive, unwieldy coalition. Its activists tend to be long-term party members – often, like its chair, Jon Lansman, with backgrounds in the post-1968 new left. The new left in Labour – which produced figures as disparate as Ken Livingstone and Margaret Hodge – were much more committed to anti-racist and feminist politics than Militant’s shop-floor Leninism, and saw no need for centralist structures. This meant they never broke the party rulebook in the same way. This can be seen now in the way that Momentum is a strange amalgam of a PR agency, a decentralised activist network and a media organisation, without a deep connection between each part.Momentum has faced its own entryism spats, but they are of a very different cast to those of the 1980s. It’s an open secret that the pro-People’s Vote wing of the Labour left is dominated by members or ex-members of Trotskyist groups such as Mason’s old outfit, Workers’ Power. Lansman at one point had to change Momentum’s entire membership structure to prevent these groups from leading the organisation. But in this case “the Trots” are actually allies of Labour’s centre, and are deeply associated with its questionable second referendum policy.In fact, it makes more sense to compare Corbyn to Kinnock rather than to Foot. Both took over after the dominant wing of Labour had lost a second consecutive general election – 1979 then 1983, 2010 then 2015. Both were subject to horrendous press hate campaigns. Both led – more enthusiastically in Kinnock’s case – campaigns against Labour local authorities, for illegal spending to build council houses in Liverpool, and for planning to sell off council houses in a property boondoggle in Haringey. Both of them aimed to adapt to “new times”, acknowledging, respectively, that in the 1980s Thatcherism had dismantled the old Labour class coalition, making the young, working population likely to vote Tory and that the 2008-09 financial crisis had made Blairism’s giddy bubble economics extremely implausible.Both conclusions were bitterly resisted by the old guard, but their attempts to seize the leadership – Tony Benn in 1988, Owen Smith in 2016 – were swatted away with ease, as they had no new ideas, and could easily be told “we know where that leads – defeat”, whether the “longest suicide note in history” or the “Ed Stone”.Most of all, it seems Kinnock and Corbyn share the fact that each losing two consecutive elections themselves didn’t lead to their total discrediting within the party. This has led to surprise outside Labour, but it’s logical – both Kinnock and Corbyn, though both avoiding any major rulebook changes (unlike, say, Blair) were overwhelmingly popular with most members, even after their defeats (though Corbyn never had it from the parliamentary party). As the positioning of MPs such as Keir Starmer and Clive Lewis has already made clear, most candidates in the upcoming leadership election will stand as post-Corbyn, not anti-Corbyn – just as all serious contenders after Kinnock were his conscious heirs.None of this means that some Tony Blair of the left is around the corner to lead Labour to glorious victory. Though Kinnock was radical compared with Blair or Gordon Brown, and faced the vitriolic wrath of Rupert Murdoch because of it, Corbyn’s politics, both imputed and real, were considered a genuine threat to the British state, and his successors will be under enormous pressure to buckle accordingly.Even though, by 1997, a general election victory seemed an open goal for Labour, just to make sure of it the new leader ingratiated himself with the media that had destroyed his predecessor. It is unlikely that any of the current leadership candidates will be able to be quite so ingratiating but what could yet be the same is the crushing of lives and hopes that led to that 1997 Labour government, when it finally arrived, standing on a platform that continued most of the Conservatives’ policies.• Owen Hatherley is an author and the culture editor of Tribune"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93dc9ffc29b3d653d0c5cfb5e83ca3d525e3e1d2/0_0_4252_2677/master/4252.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd11026e0ff6322b704c36a81c1be61d 700w","title":"moral of the story 2019s boldest culture asked what it means to be good","story":"At a time when deceit is trumping decency, artists from Kanye West to Greta Gerwig and Phoebe Waller-Bridge have taken it upon themselves to pose questions about virtue and privilegeIn Greta Gerwig’s new adaptation of Little Women, a haughty publisher dismisses Jo March’s stories as unfashionable. “Morals don’t sell nowadays,” he tells the aspiring author. “People want to be amused, not preached at.” Hopefully the statute of limitations has expired on spoiling a 151-year-old story: March – an avatar for her creator, Louisa May Alcott – proves him wrong. As has Gerwig, reviving Little Women in a year where a great deal of culture has considered the question of what it means to be good when the answer is less clear than ever.A decade of consciousness-raising via Twitter and Tumblr has complicated the issue, often by using culture and its makers to arbitrate issues of morality, from cultural appropriation to micro- and macro-aggressions. Even the concept of cancel culture ended up getting … cancelled: debunked by critics, often of colour, who pointed out that nobody who had been cast aside for their infractions had gone away or lost much as a result. If so-called cancel culture was actually effective, then Donald Trump’s history of sexually degrading comments (and alleged sexually degrading behaviour) and racist business practices would have impeded his path to the White House – an idea that seems increasingly like a fairytale as the far right mount a successful pushback that has resulted in a moral void in world leadership. Politicians and lower-level scammers have proven that deceit seldom gets in the way of success or power. It’s fallen to children to hold adults to account for the decades of irresponsible, selfish consumption that has accelerated the climate crisis.Art became a space where these matters could be litigated, and tangible change could be reassuringly felt. It was inevitable that the question would resurface in culture, a longstanding concern pressed into new shapes as artists reach for the certainties of family, religion, self-respect and nature. The problem is that there appear to be diametrically opposed views on what constitutes goodness, who sets those standards and who benefits from them. At the start of 2018, New Statesman critic Anna Leszkiewicz wrote about what she called “morality TV”, exploring why “characters on screen are more anxious, guilty and self-hating than ever”. The protagonists of shows including Search Party, Bojack Horseman and The Good Place were obsessed with whether they were good or bad people, she wrote. Almost two years later, that binary has become infinitely granular: not about being good or bad per se, but more the existential consideration of those qualities. At the start of series two of Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character offers a supercut of the virtuous things she’s done to get her life back on track: exercise, smoothies, sobriety. She is a better person than the mascara-smeared mess who sort of killed her best friend in series one. But – surprise! – all the “new year, new you” tropes can’t fill her cavernous existential holes. Fleabag’s second coming asked that great Russian novel question: how can you live a good life at a time of great suffering when there may or may not be a God?The essays in New Yorker staff writer Jia Tolentino’s debut collection Trick Mirror turned over the complicated motivations behind contemporary performances of virtue – a question that found perhaps its definitive manifestation in Kanye West’s turn towards gospel this year. Critics asked whether his religious awakening was merely a cynical attempt at redemption after a distinctly troubled period that saw him endorse Trump and describe slavery as “a choice”. Admittedly it was difficult to accept West slut-shaming his wife in the name of the Lord on his album Jesus Is King, and to take his invite-only Sunday Service worship sessions – complete with merch including a $50 pair of socks and a $225 sweater – as a sign of a true believer, rather than an untrammelled god complex. But in an episode of the New York Times’s Popcast, gospel critics said the community was welcoming of his forays into the genre. If the Christian response to West is one of forgiveness and acceptance, then cynicism itself becomes suspect.That dynamic, where unexpected circumstances challenged a character’s long-held ideas about what it meant to be good, played out on screen. The two proud nerds of Booksmart are contemptuous of their hard-partying classmates until they learn that the bad kids are, in fact, matching their grades and having fun. Being good has only held their lives hostage. A more X-rated version of that revelation drove in HBO’s Mrs Fletcher. Kathryn Hahn’s titular character, a feminist mother and orcee, is appalled by her teenage son’s degraded sexual politics. But when he leaves for college, she develops a heavy porn habit that offers her unprecedented liberation.Artists further questioned who set the rules around morality and who actually benefits from adhering to them. At the end of Big Little Lies’ first series, it was Bonnie’s decency that drove her to run at Perry as he was strangling his wife, Celeste, pushing him down a flight of stairs and to his death. That sense of virtue returns in series two: no matter that she killed Perry to save Celeste, Bonnie still killed a man, and she falls apart under the pressure of lying. Meanwhile, her wealthy, white peers conceal the deed beneath the veneer that covers their lives, and carry on as before. The outward appearance of being a good father leads readers to sympathise with the newly orced protagonist of Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s novel Fleishman Is in Trouble – until his estranged wife finally enters the frame and offers a sucker-punch perspective flip.Even straightforward matters of justice acquired new wrinkles. In Marielle Heller’s film Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Melissa McCarthy portrays Lee Israel, a biographer on her uppers who resorts to becoming a successful literary forger. It’s a Robin Hood tale: as the breadline recedes into the distance, deception comes to look like a legitimate survival tactic. In Succession, meanwhile, a whistleblower threatens to overthrow Waystar Royco, and we watch Cousin Greg toy with whether to play his ace in service of financial reward or moral fortitude. His privilege – a young white man who has swiftly become accustomed to newfound wealth – means this hapless antihero slyly finds an option that combines both.It’s a rare circumstance. In Rian Johnson’s Knives Out, a wealthy family that telegraphs its liberal credentials through New Yorker subscriptions and conspicuous wokeness becomes outraged when it transpires that the late patriarch, a celebrated author, has left his entire estate to his Latina carer. Marta, the daughter of an undocumented immigrant, appears to have killed him by accidentally and becomes embroiled in the whodunnit. But as his family members are revealed to be conniving and varyingly complicit, Marta exonerates herself – and reveals the true culprit – by always doing the decent thing. She inherits the estate. But the film acts as a sort of reverse Get Out, the rub being that the “good” immigrant can never win: not even model citizens are safe from racist attitudes and immigration policies.Delving into the March sisters’ later lives, she touches on Amy March setting up a foundation to support ambitious women. Gerwig’s film is a comparable yardstick: it’s a testament to her own ambition – to the depth of her research, her renowned care and respect as a director and collaborator – and a film whose politics, success and critical acclaim should create more opportunities for women film-makers in Hollywood. Gerwig has done everything right – and yet she’s been overlooked at the Golden Globes, which generally pave the way for the Oscar nominations.

This being the most-streamed song of the decade is like saying the initial illustrated storyboard for Avengers is the most-watched film. Still, I suppose nothing defines the 2010s more than everything being so terrible that barely competent mediocrity suddenly becomes the appealing option.The 2007 funky house classic Do You Mind had already defined Kyla’s decade it was around the time she recorded the vocal for the track that she started dating one of its producers, Errol Reid. They married, had kids and she pretty much stopped making music and then one day she got a call from Sony saying Drake wanted to sample her vocal.

His models wore them over pleated tutus and bell-shaped suit-dresses, accessorised with papier-mache-looking football helmets, broken umbrellas and headbands in the red, white and blue of the US flag.Browne used the item as a focal point for his show, which revolved around sexual identity. “The codpiece is a whimsical representation of masculinity,” he said. And at the height of its popularity in the 1540s, the item indicated machismo to its Renaissance audience.Victoria Bartels, the author of What Goes Up Must Come Down: A Brief History of the Codpiece, said: “The interesting thing about 16th-century male fashion is the way in which it reveals what was important to men at this time: their preoccupation with masculinity, military prowess and virility.”And it was about signalling power to other men, rather than being a symbol of fecundity. Henry VIII wore it in several portraits, including Hans Holbein the Younger’s Portrait of Henry VIII, c 1536-1537.“I think that they were intended to induce awe,” he said. The book also talks about the fraudulence of the codpiece as an item that promised more than it delivered and contributing to a fabricated, fictionalised version of the male body.“It encouraged concentration on the organ of generation, as if to prove at a stroke or a single overwhelming thrust, and beyond doubt, that man was a mighty and unstoppable factory and machine,” he wrote.This idea of signalling masculine power in the absence of real substance is something that has been used by modernist practitioners of the codpiece, from Blackadder to Darth Vader and Michael Jackson, whose dance moves focused on his crotch even when he was not wearing his golden codpiece.“He was a particularly sad case of self-reconstruction,” Glover said about Jackson. “Every bit of him, from nose to skin to groin, had to be made brightly anew for fandom’s sake.”Shakespeare also picked up on the codpiece. He referenced its dual properties of deception and braggadocio in King Lear and Measure for Measure. In The Two Gentlemen of Verona, Lucetta makes a male costume as a disguise for Julia and says: “You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam … A round hose, madam, now’s not worth a pin unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.”Glover said: “Shakespeare was the great, instinctive etymologist. He knew how words tricked with their double and triple meanings: ‘cod’ as scrotum, ‘to cod’ meaning to cheat.”The current revival in menswear for this 16th-century piece follows the womenswear trend for “Renaissancecore”. The era has been mined by designers from Alexander McQueen to Vivienne Westwood and Simone Rocha. Explaining fashion’s obsession with the era, the designer Gareth Pugh said: “The Tudors were the first power dressers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08d4af9aff09afaa18a8a1496d99a9822d36a9a9/0_338_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6c8d01020a9676e5b094c3c91e700b0","title":"anna karina catherine deneuve how movies malign women by calling them muses","story":"Male directors have often diminished the highly creative women who inspired them. Will the rise of female film-makers revolutionise the role of ‘muse’?Amid tributes to Anna Karina, who died earlier this month, the word “muse” recurred. As in “the muse of Jean-Luc Godard” or “Karina served as a cinematic muse to Godard”. And in nearly every homage and obituary, you could sense the writer making a valiant effort to acknowledge that Karina was more than just a passive repository of a male auteur’s creativity: that she appeared in films by other renowned directors, starred in a TV musical (Anna) with songs by Serge Gainsbourg, made albums, did theatre, wrote and directed two films, and wrote four novels.But it is Godard’s attempts to define and contain Karina’s allure that gives his early films much of their appeal. Time and again, the performer transcends her material, giving it that extra je ne sais quoi even when the writing leaves something to be desired. (Godard seems to have trouble conceiving that the female experience revolves around anything other than prostitution, duplicity, or wanting babies.) It is symptomatic that during the Madison dance scene in Bande à Part (1964), when the male narrator – Godard himself – voices Odile’s inner thoughts, he informs us she is thinking about her breasts. (According to male authors, we think about our breasts all the time, as satirised by the much-quoted meme: “She breasted boobily to the stairs, and titted downwards.”)The dictionary reminds us the Muses were sister-goddesses who inspired learning and the arts. The “muse” came to represent artistic inspiration in the abstract, and was then popularly incarnated as the female model or lust object of a male artist. Only now is it being acknowledged that the creative achievements of celebrated muses such as Kiki de Montparnasse or Dora Maar, as artists in their own right, were overshadowed by famous male artists’ portrayals of them in paintings, photographs or films. Maar currently has a retrospective at Tate Modern in London.Likewise, the relationship between muse and film-maker has traditionally been regarded as that of a male auteur and his female acteur fétiche, often an offscreen lover, over whom he wields a Trilby-like influence. For The Blue Angel, Joseph von Sternberg transformed an actress he reportedly found “bovine and charmless” into one of the most iconic presences of the 20th century, but in the seven films they made together, Marlene Dietrich learned so much about lighting and camera angles that it is no longer possible to tell where one’s contribution ends and the other’s begins.François Truffaut once said of Catherine Deneuve: “I wouldn’t compare her to a flower or a bouquet, since there is a certain neutrality in her that leads me to compare her to the vase in which all the flowers are placed.” He meant that her reserve and air of mystery enabled spectators to “fill the vase” themselves but the history of male film directors and their female muses is also a history of vase-filling: men translating their erotic fantasies into cinematic terms while failing to get to grips with the women themselves, who are invariably depicted as quixotic and inscrutable, even dangerous.But while it is the male film-makers who are hailed as creators, actors such as Karina, or Monica Vitti for Michelangelo Antonioni, have creative agency, too, even if their contributions tend to be dismissed as some mysterious life force, or “naturalness”. The history of male auteurs and their female muses is essentially a history of “othering” women, even if the flower arrangements can be bewitching in themselves in their presentation of the self, the creation of a persona, the playing around with behaviour and appearance and pose.There are partnerships that are recognised by critics as collaborations of equals – that of Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes, for example – but the mythology surrounding the male gaze still holds sway. It’s the man who is the artist, while the woman provides the empty vase. Conversely, if it’s a male actor filling a muse-like function for his male director, it’s considered a meeting of best mates in which the performer is perceived to have creative parity, like Robert De Niro remoulding himself for a Martin Scorsese film, or a clash of alpha-male egos – such as Klaus Kinski and Werner Herzog threatening to kill each other.With a rising number of female directors, I wonder whether we will see a corresponding proliferation of male muses. Of the three films Joanna Hogg made with Tom Hiddleston, it’s only in the first, Unrelated, that he is presented as an object of desire, lolling sun-kissed and shirtless in the Tuscan landscape. But the torch was passed to another actor, the excellent Tom Burke, for this year’s The Souvenir. Perhaps there would have been more onscreen heat in the stubbornly unsexy Fifty Shades of Grey if director Sam Taylor-Johnson had been able to cast her husband, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, as Christian Grey. It may never happen: female auteurism is likely to develop along lines very different from the male version. More collaborative, and less flower arranging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5251a949d2511635dd68c9958129c9c51feb3542/0_124_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960d5efb183a3579c360218690d27a48","title":"decade in cinema hollywood monsters netflix auteurs motion smoothing movies daytime tv","story":"Hollywood’s monsters were exposed, streaming services embraced auteurs and ‘motion smoothing’ made the movies look like daytime TVThe long decade closes with no consensus on what we were supposed to call it (the “teens”?) nor about what ground has been gained or lost in the big cinema debates of the past 10 years. Steven Spielberg warned of a colossal evolutionary crisis in theatrical distribution, whereby the film business becomes over reliant annually on three or four big “tentpole” movies that will then crash, leaving us with the movie equivalent of 2008 or even 1929. And the tentpoles that everyone is betting on are the superhero films, which Spielberg warned will go the way of the western. Well, this hasn’t happened yet.So a new herovillain has arisen: Marvel Studios, which has enjoyed a staggering explosion of box-office popularity, blessed by cinema chains for providing surefire hits, but increasingly loathed by cinephiles for dumbing down the movies. Martin Scorsese, in his widely shared New York Times article, expanded his personal view that superhero films are just glorified theme-park rides without the inidual artistry and humanity of real cinema.But Scorsese created a controversy of his own by taking his new film to Netflix. Two of the best films of the year, Scorsese’s The Irishman and Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, are Netflix products, released in cinemas for a short while and then absorbed on to the site to attract new subscribers and gratify existing ones.And it’s not just Netflix. One of the best films of this year – and the decade – was Beanpole, by the brilliant young Russian director Kantemir Balagov it had a handful of big-screen showings at the London film festival, then went straight to Mubi streaming. It’s an awful shame, although the streaming sites offer large-scale viewer access and hospitality to newer, younger film-makers. (And for independent arthouse films to exist only briefly in cinemas is nothing new.)As for superhero films (Gen-Z westerns), there is no doubt that many studio executives are mesmerised by their bankability and less likely to take a punt on other genres of film. I have, however, written about tendencies that are more worrying: high frame-rate and “motion smoothing” on new TVs that can make films clearer, but flatter and blander, like daytime TV. As for cinema admissions, they are holding pretty steady at 170m annually in the UK, helped by the investment in the cinema-going experience – although the novelty of getting food delivered to your seat is surely a step too far.In this decade, Hollywood woke up, or was rudely awakened, to issues of ersity and social justice by the #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo movements, driven by social media. Voting membership of the Academy has also been changed to bring in a younger generation, women and people of colour. Harvey Weinstein may be about to reach a deal in the civil courts, to the outrage of many, but Roman Polanski has faced a resurgence of discontent with his reputation. His new film, An Officer and a Spy – although favourably received on the film festival circuit – has had no UK showing.The question of ersity (so long disputed by men of a certain age who wish to be congratulated on their courage in rejecting “quotas”) is far from answered, but new voices are emerging in Britain with fascinating and brilliant films. There is outstanding work from female British film-makers such as Carol Morley, Joanna Hogg, Clio Barnard and Rungano Nyoni – and elsewhere, great directors such as Kelly Reichardt, Anna Biller, Lucrecia Martel, Chloé Zhao and Debra Granik.As for auteur cinema, some commentators have found it too bound up in male privilege. But great – even historic – work has come from Jessica Hausner, Mia Hansen-Løve and Martel, as well as established silverbacks such as Quentin Tarantino, Yorgos Lanthimos and Paul Thomas Anderson, whose most recent film, Phantom Thread, was the curtain-call for that extraordinary acting talent, Daniel Day-Lewis. From Asia, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Jia Zhangke and Bong Joon-ho have continued to produce dazzling work. But if there is a big auteur whose stock is a bear market, it has to be Abdellatif Kechiche, whose multi-part epic of sexiness, Mektoub My Love, is increasingly baffling.The decade’s other great issue is Brexit – and it is remarkable how movies in the UK have failed to address it (although the new romcom Last Christmas, for all its ickiness, does mention the B-word and attempt to dramatise its attendant issues). From within the industry, producers such as Eric Fellner and Jeremy Thomas are railing against the woeful ision that it is opening up, especially with regard to the free movement of people and equipment across the Channel. Brexit burdens film with a bureaucratic nightmare.With the decade coming to an end, I am optimistic about many of the issues I wrote about to mark the half-decade, especially the way digital technology has enabled young film-makers to get their work made, and raise money for new work, through sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter. I am less happy about the state of documentary. Five years ago, we were in the middle of a “surge” now I am seeing documentaries that feel lightweight, sometimes almost negligible, often taking refuge in postmodern self-reference about the chaotic difficulties of making documentaries. Perhaps there are – at present – too many documentarians chasing too few genuinely strong subjects.Britain has endured austerity for the past 10 years, so it is extraordinary how documentaries have not reflected this. It has been left to the eightysomething veteran Ken Loach (in partnership with the screenwriter Paul Laverty) to tackle the issue directly and simply with I, Daniel Blake and Sorry We Missed You.Perhaps the other issue is the nature of criticism itself. It is tiresome and self-pitying for critics to complain about social media – especially as social media has done so much to galvanise and invigorate criticism – but in the teens there was more retrenchment, more abuse. Along with a handful of other critics, I disliked Joker, the new origin myth movie for Batman’s great villain, starring Joaquin Phoenix. But whatever that film’s problems, it is incomparably more interesting and intelligent than its online fanboy trolls and hatebombers, though I was spared the misogyny that women writers experienced on this subject.What is extraordinary is how threatened people still are by dissenting opinion, an aggressive neurosis that is probably intensified by the bizarre consensus machine Rotten Tomatoes and its meaninglessly pseudo-scientific ratings that paralyse the idea of considered analysis. Inidual critical voices are what count what count even more are inidual film-making talents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1486fc62437197159f3813239f1718147c8bc770/0_652_2251_1350/master/2251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42d987aa85b974383fe21c7c614ef0d3","title":"anna jones new years eve recipes banh mi lemongrass ginger margaritas","story":"My dream party food: a soft baguette stuffed with veg, sriracha and tofu.

As an omnivore (admittedly one that ate little meat but a lot of dairy and eggs), I just couldn’t imagine writing recipes week after week with such a strict set of rules, let alone enjoy eating plant-based food on a regular basis. But then, something wonderful happened.Taking meat, fish, dairy or eggs out of cooking became a catalyst for creativity, forcing me, and many other chefs and food writers, to think in new and interesting ways about how to extract the most flavour and pleasure from the same old characters in the vegetable drawer.I discovered that the Asian larder, replete with its fermented and pickled ingredients such as kimchi and miso, could add flavour to meals in an instant. I reacquainted myself with the thrill of pulses and turning dry beans into nourishing meals, and I realised that cakes can be just as rich and fluffy and velvety without dairy and eggs.During the two and a half years that I’ve been writing the column, the innovation in plant-based food in recipe-writing, restaurant menus and even ready meals has been of an unprecedented breadth and scale. Vegan food is an exciting, easier and more delicious way to eat than ever.I am doing Veganuary this year in the main because I want to show you how enjoyable it can be. But also, because what we choose to put on our plates undeniably impacts the world around us. You, however, might be doing it because you feel bloated after the annual Christmas meat-fest or because it’s cheaper than eating meat, for reasons of animal welfare or just because Natalie Portman does it.For whatever reason, I’m here to help you through the next weeks with my meal plans.A few tips. The best advice I can give you is to make a plan of all the things you want to eat. Perhaps write them down here then make a shopping list based on that. If time is not on your side, focus on dinner. Breakfast could be cereal and lunch a throw-together affair involving pitta bread, jarred antipasti and a dollop of hummus. And finally, if a piece of ham should accidentally fall into your mouth this week, get back up and keep on going.I can’t promise a new you after a week, but you might think, like I now do, that plant-based is both achievable and delicious – and that thought may give you the freedom of choice over what you eat, which might just make you feel alive, well and hungry for more.Breakfast is easy – just be sure to stock up on some good vegan milk. My preference is for Oatly because it’s great in tea, coffee and porridge. Anna Jones has your back with this DIY instant porridge (below) or if you’ve got no time in the morning, try making Felicity Cloake’s bircher muesli the night before. Or else, buy granola. No one’s judging and besides, Dorset Cereals make a great one.On the weekend, try a tofu scramble, which is not by any means a substitute for egg, but a serious contender. Yotam Ottolenghi has a harissa recipe and I have a Parsi-style akuri, made using tomatoes, chilli and ginger.These days, every supermarket, food chain and cafe has as many chickpea wraps, soups and salads as you can shake a celery stick at. But if you want to make your own, the easiest route is to make extra at dinner and pack leftovers. Or, for a quick from-scratch throw-together option, consider Rosie Birkett’s broccoli and peanut noodles or her orzo and roast cauliflower salad.I’d suggest starting with a big pot of delicious beans so there’s something in the fridge this week. Try either my Iraqi white bean stew or this satisfying coconut dal with lime kale and some boiled rice alongside.During the week, you need meals built with speed in mind, but without compromise on flavour. How about this wild mushroom ragout with ziti by David Tanis, or Nigel Slater’s purple sprouting broccoli with cashews and tofu?Feeling the need for something fresh? This rice noodle salad with cucumber and poppy seeds ought to do the job.Friday night is curry night in the Sodha household. Might I recommend my Thai green curry? Feel free to play around with the vegetables, and don’t let the list of ingredients fool you – most get thrown into a blender and whizzed up into a quick curry paste.Welcome to the weekend. Treat yourself to these Anna Jones instant tacos and pop Ottolenghi’s ultimate tray bake ragu in the oven.Sweet tooth? This carrot, apple and orange cake from Gaz Oakley looks perfect, or these raspberry and coconut thumb print cookies from Ruby Tandoh.Now sit back, relax and congratulate yourself for getting to the end of the first week.

The King Power Stadium was a boisterous place with Liverpool’s world champions in town. New-build stadiums can often be deathly places. Not this one, with its operatic pre-match fanfare, its sense of high-end underdog glamour and with a Leicester team unbeaten at home in the league this season.At which point, enter the red machine and, in particular, another extraordinary, incisive and deeply unusual performance from Trent Alexander-Arnold.Every week the Premier League team-sheets seem to make the same category-mistake with Liverpool’s defence. Liverpool’s No 66 plays (it says here) at right-back. In reality Alexander-Arnold is something else, a 21-year-old footballer whose talent has redefined his role, creating in the process something new and excitingly disruptive.Alexander-Arnold made two goals, scored Liverpool’s last one in a 4-0 win and looked irresistible at times. He is an extraordinary player in so many ways, a full-back who operates at a constant level of creative urgency.Some will point to the occasional holes in the defensive part of his game, flaws that were apparent here at times early in the match. But this is to miss the point to a world-class degree.There is a basic sense of optimism about Liverpool’s running game, a feeling the team can shift like a single mass to cover its weaknesses with strengths. Liverpool do not have a goalscoring centre-forward (he scored twice here). Liverpool did not have their best defensive midfielder (they did not need him). And, of course, Liverpool don’t have a world-class playmaker. Except they do and he’s currently bombing forward from right-back.It helps when you play in a team like this. At times Leicester seemed almost craven in the face of Liverpool’s passing, movement and – yes – that alpha dog energy this team carries with it now.“We’re champions of the world,” the away section sang throughout the night. Not that a Fifa junket was needed to settle that question. From the Persian Gulf to the East Midlands this is a team operating at a thrillingly high pitch, the kind of run where every game feels like a rollover from the last, and where the plan remains always the same. Don’t stop. Don’t look back. Carry on being a bit more like themselves every time.There was something stately about Liverpool’s dominance in that first half. Even the half-scuffed clearances fell to a red shirt. Even Alexander-Arnold’s shaky delivery on the first few set pieces felt like a high-grade machine settling into its rhythms And in a game that always felt like a kind of homecoming, it was fitting that Liverpool’s locally sourced right-back should create the breakthrough with half an hour gone.The goal came from a cross from the left hit with a furious dipping power. Alexander-Arnold is sui generis in this too. Nobody else kicks the ball in quite the same way, with the same inventive precision, the same flat skimming trajectory. His crosses are like shots. His shots are like passes. His corners are like free-kicks.The cross landed on the head of Roberto Firmino, who nodded it down into the corner. Liverpool had scored with their sixth effort on goal, to Leicester’s zero. The second half brought more of the same. Alexander-Arnold’s corner drew a handball from Caglar Soyuncu. James Milner tucked away the penalty. Shortly afterwards Firmino made it 3-0 from another hard, flat cross from the right.That assist made it eight for Alexander-Arnold so far in the Premier League. Only Kevin De Bruyne has more. Look further back and Alexander-Arnold has 20 assists in the league since the start of last season, out on his own ahead of everyone. No doubt English football has produced deep right-sided creative players who can match Alexander-Arnold’s extraordinary productivity in the modern age. But none spring to mind right now.Leicester were not helped by their own cautious start. In the first half Jamie Vardy was often the lone forward point of a distended 4‑5‑1 formation. The plan was obvious: sit deep, let Liverpool pass, break with precision.The only problem was, it never showed any sign of working. Liverpool know teams will play like this. They counter-press so aggressively the chances to break are hugely reduced. Before you know it 40 minutes have passed without a shot on goal and the game is being played at an exhausting level of intensity around your own goal.Liverpool absorbed some pressure as the game wore on but always looked like scoring more. Alexander-Arnold’s goal arrived on 78 minutes, a low hard drive into the far corner, and the gloss on a performance of real drive and verve. Liverpool ended the day 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League, still a little jet-lagged from their desert break, still cranking the throttle. So much for the world. Next stop, England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f63be4f9a34ff6dc3e25f847329348dc7550434b/313_417_5745_3447/master/5745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f2c0afef25cf86908e3e8ccdc6d3134","title":"have i turned into auntie b most conservative relative coco khan","story":"‘You sound just like Mum,’ my nieces say, when I talk to them about makeupRecently, my Auntie B (my most conservative relative) presented me with a gift. “I’m told these are fashionable,” she enthused, as I unfolded the paper to reveal a racy negligee. This from a woman who can’t watch television without declaring it pornography. (“EastEnders? A dirty show with dirty ideas! David Attenborough’s new project? You cannot deny it is suggestive.”) It seemed like a miracle.But it was the work of the nieces. They’re teens, and the embodiment of today’s internet culture: fragile, brimming with potential, while also terrifying and dictatorial.

Until the conversation turns to makeup.My nieces wear a lot of makeup. “You sound just like Mum!” they’ll say when I mention clogged pores, which is my main concern, not modesty. OK, fine, I care about the pressures of beauty standards, too. Also, constant sexualisation – at which point they roll their eyes and say it’s funny the way I think I’m so different from Auntie B yet somehow so much the same.They are sharp. So when they asked if I liked the negligee, I spoke honestly. I adhere to the slobwear school of PJs, I said, and found it too cold, too itchy – and isn’t it a bit grownup for them? (“It’s fashion,” they said.) I told them my theory, that all this (the makeup, the PJs) stems from a lack of personal privacy the need to be Insta-ready.It’s fine for them to disagree, but what came next was out of order. “That’s interesting,” said one. “Will have a think, Auntie C.” Kids can be so cruel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/838919181440322dd623cf910eacdb927bf422df/110_1093_2198_1318/master/2198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4244718e51dd6a2086bba96ef32f06f","title":"italian heritage uncle ron thank you","story":"In this series writers celebrate a person who changed their lives. Paula Cocozza recalls the relative who lived in Worthing ‘but always seemed to have one foot in Italy’Or should I say “Uncle Ron”, because that is how I always addressed you, even well into my 40s? I guess a part of me continued to feel like the small girl who slipped secretively under the table, still laden with Sunday lunch, to climb up on your knee. I always feared someone else would get there first. And I was in a rush to reach you. Some people are peaceful to be near, and that’s how I found you.The journey under the table wasn’t far – I was wise enough to arrange the chairs favourably – but it felt to me like a journey to a different land. At some point in adulthood, I came to understand that this land was Italy. If these things were measured purely in blood, well, you were no more Italian than your siblings – my dad, and my other wonderful uncle and aunt. But you, more than anyone, seemed to have one foot in Italy. As a bachelor, you continued to live in Villa Latina – not a villa, of course, but a small terrace house in Worthing, which your parents, when they settled here, named after your late father’s village. It seemed like a piece of Italy to me, and not just because of its exotically turquoise bathroom suite.Being the eldest living sibling, you knew more about the Italian branches of the family than anyone else. You mourned the loss of the old family ice-cream recipe: there lay a secret and perhaps a treasure chest of vanilla-flavoured gold. Flush with the cash from your nocturnal fishing trips, you invested in Linguaphone cassettes to learn Italian my grandparents hadn’t taught you, wanting you to grow up English. But you were my Italian uncle, and when I sat on your knee our family background came to the fore. I could feel Italy at my shoulders.As a teenager, I taught myself Italian and since progress with the old Linguaphone tapes was slow, I overtook you. I resolved to live in Italy one day, and when I did, you came to visit me. We went together to find the real Villa Latina and to root out anyone we could find who shared our surname. Outside the village we stumbled upon a sign to via Fontana Cocozza and I have the photo, right here, of you pointing up at it with your stick. We never did find the fountain, but that’s Italian road signs for you. In any case, by then your knee was playing up getting around was beginning to be tricky.Well, Uncle Ron, I’m so grateful to you for the way you brought Italy close to hand. I don’t think I’d have found my way there without you. And at least when life got tough for you at the end, we had our Italian memories to share. I took the photo of you by the sign to show you in hospital that gave us a chuckle. I’m grateful to have had a chance that day to tell you all this, and to thank you in person, while there was still time. It would be too late now. But it’s good to put these things in writing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab53fd48c31a5028e17f998e9eea62a9d2589105/0_563_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9bed23277ae310f298d3da7e3b8e43e","title":"jack monroe motherhood thank you brave father","story":"In this series writers celebrate a person who changed their lives. Jack Monroe thanks the calm, reassuring presence who has helped her through 10 years of motherhoodIt’s been nearly 10 years now, and I’ve never really managed to put into words what I’m about to say, because the words are so big, and so small, and there are so many to choose from, unspoken, unbidden, I never really know where to start. So I’ll start from the beginning.I still remember the first day we met, at the Basildon coffee shop we worked in. I was new and you were laughing as you showed me the ropes: how to froth the milk differently for a cappuccino and a latte how to pour the coffee so the crema on the top was just right. You were patient with my clumsiness, and everybody respected you, and more importantly, enjoyed your company. Little did we know, then, how it would all turn out. “I think that cream is off”, you furrowed your brow, holding out a frappuccino for me to test. As I leaned in to sniff it, you dunked my head in. I flicked it at your face, and mayhem ensued.A few years, and many more practical jokes later, I nervously told you I was pregnant. You didn’t hesitate. “Anything you decide to do, anything you need, I’ll support you,” you said. I was so frightened, and you were so strong and steadfast. It’s been that way ever since. Our patchwork family – mother, father, our partners, your additional children, your parents, my parents, our partners’ parents, sisters, cousins, and everyone in between, have all helped to raise this small boy between us.We don’t fight. I don’t recall a single argument we co-operate without drama or disarray. I’ve done some stupid things in the past 10 years and you have quietly picked up the pieces each time. At every new school, after every failed relationship, you have been there with your silent reassurance. I’ve been a mess, but I’m doing OK now, and one of the threads holding this whole damn scruffy tapestry together is you.I know this may slightly embarrass you, because you are modest and humble, but I want to thank you for the last decade, as we look to the next one and whatever it holds and for the greatest gift of all – our son – who grows more like his father every day, with his big blue eyes, his ability to hold a room and make everyone feel special his generous heart. I know we don’t really do feelings, but I bloody love you, and I couldn’t have done any of this without you. I am still frightened of motherhood, but knowing that my co-pilot on this journey is you is very reassuring. You’re the best, bravest and most decent man I’ve ever met, and I consider myself lucky every single day to be raising a son with you.Merry Christmas and, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee77c3e6c9df9ababe78e44be27ebc05fe7c6283/0_2129_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0463c5d89a9c2049d4c5c3b46447324","title":"learn how to do nothing","story":"Rather than filling every spare moment with distractions, could I find a way to be at ease in my own company?When I gave up alcohol four and a half years ago, I found I had a lot of extra time on my hands. Hours that would otherwise have been spent in the pub, slumped drunk in front of the telly or nursing a hangover were now full of opportunity. In the first six months of sobriety I started a new business, launched a slew of new projects, saw a therapist once a week, a personal trainer twice a week, trained for and completed a half-marathon, read most of the self-improvement shelf in Waterstones and really upped my flossing game.On reflection, I had simply replaced drinking with other distractions. I burnt out, got better and tried to chill out. But craving distraction remains a problem. These days, I am unable to confront even natural breaks in the working day without preplanned ersions. A walk from one meeting to the next has to be filled with a playlist or podcast. I have had to start keeping my phone in the boot of my car to stop me checking my emails at the lights.I have always found the late December void we are currently enduring to be discombobulating and stressful. I’m neither at work nor am I on holiday. I am supposed to just relax and do nothing. It sounds nice in theory, but by midday on 28 December, usually while watching Mrs Doubtfire on Channel 5, I tend to slip into an existential crisis. When my wife and kids are out of the house, and I have no pressing work deadlines, I become anxious: the nagging thought that I really should be doing something productive but can’t think what, the pressure to absorb myself in something genuinely relaxing. I start half-watching a documentary about veganism on Netflix, while idly scrolling Twitter on my phone and, with my other hand, inexplicably researching the 1980s band DeBarge on Wikipedia on my laptop. Eventually, I go upstairs to lie silently on my bed, having a small panic attack.This is a real thing, a condition recognised by psychiatrists as relaxation-induced anxiety. A recent study at Penn State University found that naturally anxious people were more likely to feel anxious while being led through relaxation exercises.A 2014 research project by the University of Virginia asked iniduals to sit alone in a room and entertain themselves with their own thoughts for 15 minutes. Should they find the task too difficult, they had the option to distract themselves with a small electric shock. Across 11 separate studies, most people said they hated being left to think. Two-thirds of men and a quarter of women chose to electrocute themselves at least once, just to alleviate the boredom.When I tell people about my inertia aversion, they always say the same thing: “Have you tried meditation?” Yes, I have, I tell them, and I was rubbish at it. Meditation takes persistence and patience, the exact qualities I am currently lacking. It’s a vicious cycle.What I’m looking for is something even less exhaustive than mindfulness: an ability to be at ease in my own company. No tricks. No mantras. No incense. I just want to learn how to do nothing.I get in touch with Timothy D Wilson, a professor of psychology and one of the authors of the self-electrocution study. He and his team published recent research suggesting that regular “thought breaks” in the day can reduce stress and might help make you more productive. “Meditation often asks you to clear your mind of thoughts, but I prefer to fill my mind with the right kind,” says Wilson. “You need to learn to fill your mind with pleasurable and fulfilling thoughts. It is another tool in the mental tool box.”I like the sound of pleasure and fulfilment, but what are the right thoughts to have? In Wilson’s study, people were encouraged to turn their minds to friends and family rather than boring, practical stuff like scheduling.I am in a hotel room, alone, on a work trip. I am sitting on the bed, writing emails. I have an hour before my next appointment, so I run a bath. I’m usually more of a shower person, but baths seem to be a big part of the relaxation industry. As I lower myself into the warm water, I remember to breathe slowly and deeply. Breathing is part of the relaxation industry, too. I try to clear my mind but it is, of course, impossible. The more silence and stillness in a room, the more scope my brain has to flit about, searching for things to worry about: I have some invoices to submit I need to catch a 6am train the next morning and book a taxi to get me to the station in time I am behind on several deadlines (including for this article – it’s hard to find the time to write about doing nothing when you are tied up with trying to do nothing). Thinking about family is stressful. I miss my wife and kids. Other relatives have done various things to irritate me. I get out of the bath. Baths take ages. Now I am worried about being late for my appointment. I am no good at taking thought breaks.Why can’t I focus? I call Guy Burgs, founder and chief tutor at the Art Of Meditation, which organises silent retreats in the UK, and tell him about my struggle. “When we have nothing to do, all we are left with is how we feel,” he explains. “So we distract ourselves from our unsettled feeling. At some point, we need to learn how to be at peace with those feelings, and we can’t do that if we keep consuming all the time. I use the water analogy. It won’t reach a calm state if you keep throwing things into it.” I search “how to do nothing” on Google. I find an author called Jenny Odell, who actually wrote a book called How To Do Nothing: Resisting The Attention Economy. I call her up in Oakland, California. “We are obsessed with being goal-orientated. I suggest doing things that are not goals-driven or results-based,” she says. Odell is a bird-watcher. She took it up as a hobby to help rest her mind. “People become too streamlined in what they pay attention to,” she says. “Changing your perspective can give your mind a break.”I am strongly attracted to this idea. In winter, robins often land in my back garden. I watch them from the window when I am waiting for the kettle to boil, first thing in the morning. I wonder what they’re up to what’s their agenda for the day? Odell is right: it’s restful to switch perspective in this way. But can I do it to order? It is easy when my mind is only half operational, and the rest of the family are still waking up. It is harder when you have to press pause on your day and start actively searching for a passing robin.I shut my laptop and stand at the back window, examining the tree tops for flapping wings, like a predatory cat. Five minutes pass. No robins. “That’s the thing about bird-watching, you have no control over it,” Odell warns. “Learning how to release control over a situation is really important.” I become annoyed with the local bird community. They are too unreliable.Perhaps a more radical approach is required. Burgs tells me his silent retreats and meditation courses are a form of aversion therapy, whereby people can confront their fear of doing nothing until it eventually dissipates.“Doing nothing won’t be comfortable at first, however you try,” he says. “You must deliberately put the time aside to do nothing, and have the discipline to get through it, even when it is boring or creates anxiety. You have to sweat it out and gnash your teeth doing nothing for a while, until you learn to cope. The only person you have to live with 247 is yourself, so you might as well learn how to do it.”I am a self-employed dad, and I can’t really justify disappearing to Wales to sit in silence for a week. Isn’t there a fast-track approach? “On a more simple level, you should get used to doing activities that have no end goal and don’t offer instant gratification,” Burgs says. “Like starting a jigsaw you know you won’t have time to finish.”I don’t want to do that, it just seems silly. “The halfway house is finding something we can get completely absorbed in without distraction,” Burgs says. “Cooking, reading or creating.” An afternoon of careful, contemplative cooking sounds great. But there is work to do and kids to feed by 6pm. Slowly peeling runner beans all afternoon looks lovely when you see an old Greek woman doing it on one of Rick Stein’s TV shows. My reality is more about hurriedly boiling some pasta while arguing about homework.There is no point contriving artificial situations. I realise that what I really need is a way of doing nothing that won’t disrupt my busy schedule too much. It sounds like a contradiction in terms, but might just be possible. I get in touch with psychologist Sandi Mann, author of The Science Of Boredom: The Upside (And Downside) Of Downtime, for advice on how I can learn to embrace being bored. “Most people don’t have an hour to spare to do this stuff, but you don’t really need it,” she says. “When you are standing in line at Tesco, or waiting to pick up the kids, resist the lure of your phone and just let your mind wander a bit. See what you might notice around you. You can achieve a great deal in short bursts of inactivity.”Author and former SAS sergeant Chris Ryan learned to channel his thoughts in this way during the course of intensive interrogation training. When I call him he is walking his dog in the Florida sunshine, but he remembers his training experiences vividly. “We would be forced to stand in the stress position for 48 hours, deprived of sleep, with white noise blaring out of big speakers,” he tells me. “I would think: ‘Right, I’m stuck here and there is no choice, so I might as well accept it.’ Then I would start to plan a big project in my mind, like building a house. I would draw the plans, then start ordering materials, calculating costs and laying foundations. I would do everything in detail, step by step, in order to distract my mind from what I was actually going through.”Two days after this conversation, I find myself on a train from London to the Yorkshire town of Thirsk, for work, a journey of roughly two-and-a-half hours. Usually, I would take the opportunity to plug in my laptop and catch up on emails, or get some writing done. Instead, I challenge myself to follow Ryan’s mental survival techniques. This is not quite SAS interrogation training, but it’s close enough: my carriage is packed, my seat is uncomfortable, I am engulfed by a cacophony of other people’s chat, and the air is filled with the smell of fast food and lager. I leave my laptop in my bag, switch off my phone, close my eyes and try to disappear to my happier place.I have had this place since I was about nine years old. It is an alternate footballing universe where my imaginary team, AFC Thameside, have all the best players and pretty much always win. There are other clubs, too, each of them created meticulously over the past three-and-a-half decades during idle moments just like this one. Until recently, I was too embarrassed to talk about it. Now I realise it is more than just a childish fantasy I failed to ditch in adulthood: it is a sophisticated and powerful psychological tool. It certainly helps me through my train journey (I fall asleep for the last hour, which is sort of cheating, but still). When I arrive at Thirsk, there is a pleasant lightness to my mood. My mind is clear and I feel refreshed (Thameside beat local rivals City of London FC in a 4-3 thriller, in case you’re interested).Later, on the phone, I explain all of this to Wilson at the University of Virginia. There is a silence as Wilson, sitting on the other end of the line, tries to comprehend the pretend soccer team that exists inside the brain of a 44-year-old man-child in England. Eventually, he says: “I think you’re on to something. Jerome L Singer is considered the godfather of daydreaming research. He had an imaginary baseball team from childhood that he used to distract his mind. It doesn’t matter what you think about as long as it gives you pleasure and takes you away from everyday strains.”Satisfied, I resolve that I have discovered the mental health equivalent to high-intensity interval training. I practise the same technique on the return journey from Thirsk. I used to spend long train journeys drinking cans of lager. I spend this one with my eyes shut thinking about the imaginary 32-time winners of the fictional All-Star Eurocup. It is not quite the stuff of the Dalai Lama, I admit. And I am not perfect. But it is one more step on a lifetime journey towards – one day – doing nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c668761df427984507ce1b8ffcf0500177be62/0_286_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b770c9b7dc7c2841d7a7e4b54a519e67","title":"2010 2019 a decade in pictures","story":"’s picture editors take a look back at some of the news photography that has defined the past 10 yearsFrom the earthquake in Haiti at the start of 2010, the decade was defined by successive international refugee crises, natural disasters and conflict.

Whatever fans make of West’s transformation into a paragon of religious devotion, they can’t accuse him of failing to put in the time.While Jesus Is King saw West absorb a heavy Christian influence into his singular hip-hop style, its follow-up trades solely in traditional gospel. Fans uninterested in his religious rebirth will find little to love here (most of the Sunday Service Choir’s vocals are a variant on this bar from More Than Anything: “I love you, Jesus  I worship and adore you  Just want to tell you  Lord, I love you more than anything.”) but the album certainly fulfils its prayerful remit. Though West’s fingerprints are harder to detect than ever before, Jesus Is Born is more full-bodied than its predecessor, which often felt like a collection of unfinished sketches. Sometimes it can sound less like a studio album than audio snatched from a publicly funded evangelical TV station, but the power of the choir is captured in these recordings and the live feel of the compositions place the listener in Kanye’s own house of prayer.Most interesting to West fans will be the new versions of older songs. Ultralight Beam is whittled down to the choir section that helped power the original. The new version of Father Stretch My Hands (simply titled Father Stretch) develops the rap song’s gospel overtures, while Follow Me – Faith reinterprets Fade. Most songs follow a similar pattern – the choir, led by a solo male voice, is backed up by a small number of live instruments – but still there are obvious highlights. Rain is one of the album’s quieter moments, led by a languid guitar line that would catch the ear of Frank Ocean. That’s How the Good Lord Works leans on a jazzy piano riff, and Souls Anchored is one of a few numbers to feature vocal leads reminiscent of 90s chart R\u0026ampB.Gospel isn’t for everyone but the excellent recent compilations World Spirituality Classics 2 and No Other Love revealed the power of Christian music when it’s driven by sober truths: that life can be a struggle, the will of man is frequently weak, sin is inescapable. The message of Jesus Is Born ­– that God is perfect and Christianity is the answer ­– will play well to the converted but its not going to move agnostics.For all the album’s artistic successes, it’s hard to imagine non-believers listening and catching the holy spirit. Delivering the same message in the same style for 84 minutes, it sometimes feels like mass does to a six-year-old. Yet the Sunday Service Choir have helped West deliver a pretty well-executed genre album. Just don’t compare it to the rest of his mighty oeuvre. Should Kanye’s interest in gospel music prove temporary, this is likely to be remembered as an oddity rather than a baptism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32573a29faa9ce05d1e3aea4130aa850a1bd75a4/0_43_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b62635d5e42fdf7cc780ce9c1230c2","title":"abandoned at sea the cargo crew adrift without wages fuel or supplies a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

She was helped by members of the public, who called an ambulance, according to reports.A witness told Cambridge News she had seen the new mother and her two children wrapped up in blankets inside ambulances when she cycled past at about 7.15am on Monday.“They were all in the ambulances by the time I cycled past,” she said. “My workmate was first on the scene, and luckily Sainsbury’s was open early that morning and she ran in there for help.The numbers of people sleeping rough across Scotland have also risen, with 2,682 people reported as having slept rough on at least one occasion.Shelter, whose figures include rough sleepers and people in temporary accommodation, estimate that overall around 320,000 people are homeless in Britain.The government’s Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which places new duties on state institutions to intervene earlier to prevent homelessness has been in force for more than a year, but two thirds of councils have warned they cannot afford to comply with it. In 2018, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, announced a one-off £30m funding pot for immediate support for councils to tackle rough sleeping.Rough sleeping and begging are illegal in ENgland and Wales under the Vagrancy Act 1824, which makes ‘wandering abroad and lodging in any barn or outhouse, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or wagon, and not giving a good account of himself or herself’ liable to a £1,000 fine. Leading homelessness charities, police and politicians have called on the government to scrap the law.Since 2014, councils have increasingly used public space protection orders to issue £100 fines. The number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has more than trebled in five years, figures show, prompting campaigners to warn that the rough sleeping crisis is out of control and has become an entrenched part of life in the country.A Labour party analysis has claimed that local government funding cuts are disproportionately hitting areas that have the highest numbers of deaths among homeless people. Nine of the 10 councils with the highest numbers of homeless deaths in England and Wales between 2013 and 2017 have had cuts of more than three times the national average of £254 for every household.A study of more than 900 homeless patients at a specialist healthcare centre in the West Midlands found that they were 60 times more likely to visit A\u0026ampE in a year than the general population in England.Sarah Marsh, Rajeev Syal and Patrick GreenfieldEast of England ambulance service told Cambridge News that paramedics went to the scene just before 7am on Monday. The woman and her children were taken to Rosie hospital, a specialist maternity hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge.Research by the  last year identified Trinity as the wealthiest of all the colleges in both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, with published assets at the time of £1.3bn.A crowdfunding campaign set up to raise money for the woman decried Cambridge as a place of “extraordinary inequality”. Jess Agar, who started the fundraiser, wrote: “Imagine giving birth alone on the pavement, in the shadow of the richest college in Cambridge.“Whether we are religious or not, many of us will be familiar with the Christmas story of a mother who gave birth to her child in poverty, seeking refuge in a stable. This is the reality for many people living on the streets.”Contributors have so far donated more than £9,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4d32fad4b76f541bded38467706306b62a17da3/202_106_3148_1889/master/3148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e99d8175d47da9d21a631a525019d7ab","title":"tiger woods the masters champion golf major","story":"It should be no act of sacrilege to suggest victory at the 2019 Masters was not the most remarkable in Tiger Woods’s celebrated career. This is a golfer who won at Augusta National by a dozen shots as a 21-year-old, who claimed the US Open by a margin of 15 in 2000 and who prevailed in the same major eight years later despite playing with a broken leg. Woods seemed to view unprecedented feats as matador’s capes.But none of this should temper the significance of Woods’s latest major triumph and 15th in total. Nor did it. His victory at Augusta reverberated way beyond sport. A sportsman once so dominant had been reduced firmly to the past tense. His slide towards oblivion appeared terminal. An athlete formerly so flawless had been dragged – partly by himself – to the depths of personal and physical despair. As Woods converted the final putt, his mother and children standing by to join in the celebrations, the ultimate redemption tale was complete.The notion of Woods as a darling of American golf fans would have been fanciful a decade ago. At that point he was in the grip of scandal after news of a series of extramarital affairs flooded into the public domain. Woods issued a now infamous public apology in February 2010 but the damage, including commercially, had been done. “I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to,” he said. Whereas history suggested Woods’s golf clubs could switch the narrative attached to him, his on-course performances regressed.Woods did win tournaments in 2012 and 2013 but none of the four he covets most. With his back causing increasing degrees of problems, multiple surgeries occurred. Woods closed out 2018 with success at the Tour Championship in Atlanta amid much fanfare but there was no real indication of what might happen next.More intriguing is that people willed it to. If inidual golf is supposedly a non-tribal environment, the swell of support for Woods over the weekend of this Masters supplied the perfect counter-theory. Maybe the public decided Woods had suffered enough. Perhaps sports fans want the form of the greatest performers to be infinite. It is possible Woods, now far more personable than at his dominant peak, has switched attitudes with his own approach.The lowest ebb was 23 months earlier. Woods – slumped, slurring and disoriented – was arrested in Florida on a driving under the influence charge. He blamed self-medication, with the intense scale of sadness for his plight notable. This may well have proved a useful line in the sand Woods’s fortunes and quality of life sharply improved. That is poetically so, given that it was such a high-profile and embarrassing incident for an inidual who has pursued privacy for decades.Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka, two players from an era inspired by Woods, led the Masters after day one. There was a five-way tie at the halfway point but Woods had, by that Friday evening, edged to within one of the quintet. The 44-year-old earned a spot in Sunday’s final grouping after a third round of 67 but to prevail he would have to break an unwanted record. Never before had Woods won a major from the position of trailing with 18 holes to play. Francesco Molinari took a two-shot lead into day four.Molinari, the 2018 Open champion, was typically stoic until he found Rae’s Creek from the 12th tee. Augusta held its breath this was Woods’s moment. As the Italian folded over the closing stretch, Woods completed a round of 70 to win by a shot. Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Xander Schauffele do not play top-level golf to finish second but in this instance one had the impression they were not overly upset.“My kids got to see what it’s like to have their dad win a major championship,” Woods said. “I hope that’s something they will never forget.” They will not and they are not alone. Woods’s major No 15 preceded sudden chatter about whether or not he could match Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18. Not long before, you would have been taken to the clubhouse in a straitjacket if engaging in the same.Even the environment was wholly appropriate. Augusta National’s shameful association with racism for so long meant Woods, now a five-times champion there, subtly laughed in the face of historical discrimination. That comfortable 1997 victory was his first in a major.Two decades later the scale of his pain as he attended the annual Masters champions’ dinner – he was unable to compete – shocked onlookers. “I could barely walk, I couldn’t sit,” he said. “I couldn’t lay down. I really couldn’t do much of anything.”The same evening he confided in some he thought he was “done” as a competitor. The winning of another major would always have grabbed global attention but performing this feat in Georgia, at the one of the four tournaments that never shifts venue, added sparkle to the story.Woods’s professional exploits of 2019 concluded by captaining the USA to retaining the Presidents Cup. Footage of the celebrating American contingent on a coach as they left Royal Melbourne emerged. “No time for losers, ’cause we are the champions … of the world.” Woods sang with glass aloft. In truth, this was a stretch. But eight months earlier? He had scaled the mountain of all mountains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/266b41e990c013d197a099e01f9b30f799b4ea3d/0_205_5080_3048/master/5080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bff254ac8fab02a41019fba49285b8a","title":"worlds richest cycling race puts keirin in spotlight before olympics","story":"The winner of this weekend’s Keirin Grand Prix in Japan will take home nearly $1m but why has international success been elusive for the 2020 Olympic hosts in the event it invented?Thousands of people armed with betting slips will pack into an ageing velodrome on the outskirts of Tokyo this weekend to watch nine cyclists compete for the title of Japan’s keirin champion.The Keirin Grand Prix is one of the highlights of the Japanese sporting calendar – and one of the richest. The first man over the line after six laps of the Tachikawa track will end the day a little under $1m (£768,000) better off, and secure a place in the history of an event that grew out of the ruins of war more than seven decades ago. Now, as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Olympics, the best of Japan’s 2,200 keirin cyclists are aiming to bring international success to the country that gave the event to the rest of the world.Japanese professional riders can earn huge sums on the domestic circuit but have failed to turn this into medal-winning performances against their international rivals. The country has won only one keirin Olympic medal – a bronze for Kiyofumi Nagai in Beijing in 2008. Benoît Vêtu, the head coach of Japan’s track team, is aiming to remedy that in Tokyo next year.“The main goal for me, and for the riders too, is to be good at the keirin at the Olympics,” Vêtu, a former French national team track cyclist, told the  after a training session at Izu Velodrome, the venue for the Olympic cycling events. “I’m always telling the riders: ‘This is a Japanese event, so you have to bring it back home to to Japan. It’s your property.’ We are working every day for that.”Two of the men on Vêtu’s team – Yudai Nitta and Yuta Wakimoto – will compete in the grand prix, along with Yuka Kobayashi, who is among the favourites for the women’s title. “The riders I have on the Olympic team are really pure,” says Vêtu. “They are not doing this for money. In other countries like China an Olympic gold is a route to money, but that doesn’t matter here, because they already have money from professional keirin. Nitta has been dreaming about the Olympics since he was a kid.”International keirin, in which riders follow a pacer bike around a 250m track before sprinting to the finish line, made its Olympic debut at the 2000 Sydney Games. The women’s event appeared 12 years later in London, where Britain’s Victoria Pendleton won gold.Some keirin watchers attribute Japan’s lack of success to differences in the rules between the domestic version and its UCI counterpart. Head-butting and shoulder barging are a feature of the sport in Japan, where riders from the same region collaborate on tracks of up to 500m. But it is the promise of making huge sums of money in Japan that keeps many promising young riders away from the international circuit.Kohei Gunji, who earned 68.5m yen (£480,000) during the first 11 months of the year, will be in the grand prix lineup for the first time but, like several other elite riders, has no Olympic ambitions. “There are riders I know who are taking time away from professional keirin to prepare for the Olympics,” Gunji said in an interview last year. “I’ll be cheering them on, but it’s not for me.”However under the guidance of Vêtu and his assistant, the former Australian track cyclist Jason Niblett, Japan’s athletes are making their presence felt on the international track. At last year’s Track Cycling World Championships, Tomoyuki Kawabata became the first Japanese man to win a keirin medal for a quarter of a century. Yuta Wakimoto won keirin gold at a World Cup meet last year – Japan’s first in the men’s event since 2003. Nitta, Tomohiro Fukaya and Yoshitaku Nagasako won the men’s team sprint title at the Brisbane leg of the World Cup this month, with Yumi Kajiwara taking gold in the women’s omnium in Hong Kong.The world’s first keirin race was held in the south-western city of Kokura – present-day Kitakyushu – three years after the end of the second world war. The city’s mayor had cobbled together the funds to build a dirt-covered track he hoped would offer a distraction for the city’s war-weary residents – particularly local men who had only recently swapped their military uniforms for overalls – and raise cash for Kokura’s reconstruction.More than 50,000 people flocked to the Kokura Velodrome over four days of racing, placing a total of 19.73m yen in bets – a massive sum at the time. Keirin – whose two kanji characters can be read as “compete” and “wheel” – quickly spread to other towns and cities. But keirin’s early history was blighted by violence, allegations of race fixing, illegal betting arranged by yakuza crime syndicates and growing calls from women’s groups and teachers’ unions to close velodromes and protect children from the curse of gambling addiction.More than 70 years later, keirin continues to occupy an uneasy place in the Japanese sporting firmament because of its association with gambling. The grand prix is one of the few occasions when the sport attracts the attention of terrestrial TV channels, but it has made attempts to modernise in recent years. The women’s event, banned in 1964, was resurrected in 2012 to broaden keirin’s appeal, while a small number of foreign cyclists are invited to compete in Japan every year, including Chris Hoy in the mid 2000s and, this year, Joe Truman, a member of the British track cycling team.Vêtu said he understood the lure of professional keirin, and will be among the spectators at Tachikawa. “I knew about the grand prix before I came to Japan three years ago, but you never get a real feeling for that race – the electric atmosphere, the craziness – until you see it for yourself,” he said.“So I’m happy that some members of the team are taking part this year, not for the money, but because they will be putting themselves under a lot of pressure, with spectators yelling at them from the stands. You can’t get better preparation for the Olympics than that.”Justin McCurry’s book, War on Wheels: Inside Keirin and Japan’s Cycling Subculture, will be published in June 2020 by Pursuit Books."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec1ace2ed2d34af2c55bbb054bfcdc959326b6c/0_26_3252_1951/master/3252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bef9d02b402594a891585fc1fa0ae723","title":"south africa v england first test day two live","story":"Jofra Archer replaces his initialsake James Anderson - and he strikes second ball! Elgar inside-edges a big nipbacker down the leg side, where Buttler flies to his right to take another good catch.8th over: South Africa 25-2 (Elgar 18, du Plessis 0) The new batsman, Faf du Plessis, is beaten by a jaffa from Broad. There’s an hour’s play remaining realistically, England need another three or four wickets in that time. Hamza is caught down the leg side. He tried to roll the wrists on a nothing delivery from Broad but got it too fine and Buttler took a good catch ing to his left. South Africa lead by 128.7th over: South Africa 25-1 (Elgar 18, Hamza 4) Elgar hits Anderson for consecutive boundaries, a slightly loose steer over backward point followed by a crisp drive through mid-off. He makes it three in four balls with a flick off the pads. Nice one.6th over: South Africa 13-1 (Elgar 6, Hamza 4) Broad has an absurd enquiry for LBW against Elgar turned down. It was missing leg stump by a long way. England are bowling pretty well, though they have not managed to repeat Philander and Rabada’s forensic near-ball examination.5th over: South Africa 11-1 (Elgar 6, Hamza 3) I bet James Anderson’s internal monologue is a thing of comic beauty right now. He has an enquiry for LBW against Elgar turned down by Chris Gaffaney. It was a good delivery but it didn’t straighten enough. Root looks vaguely interested in a review but can’t persuade anyone else that he should go upstairs.4th over: South Africa 10-1 (Elgar 6, Hamza 2) Broad beats Elgar again with a gorgeous delivery that straightens from around the wicket. He’s bowled extremely well in this game, albeit in helpful conditions, and should help himself to a few more wickets in the second innings.“The thing about Lampard-Gerrard of course is that between underwhelming outings for England they went back and performed brilliantly at club level,” says Pete Salmon. “Not so Bairstow and Buttler.”White-ball form is the new club level.3rd over: South Africa 10-1 (Elgar 6, Hamza 2) Games like this can be won - get your precedents here - but realistically England will struggle to chase anything over 150 batting last. That gives them another 36 runs to play with. If it wasn’t so funny, it would be mildly dispiriting.“Afternoon Rob,” says Nick Parish. “I’ve just woken up. Well, it is Christmas. A Tory government with a huge majority, Liverpool top of the league, and an England batting collapse. It’s like the 1980s all over again.”Yes, but at least Donald Trump isn’t oh I can’t be bothered. 2nd over: South Africa 6-1 (Elgar 4, Hamza 0) Dean Elgar avoids a king pair by ignoring his first delivery from Stuart Broad. He is beaten by the second, a Warner special, and then edges between second slip and gully for four. It wasn’t at catchable height but it do go into a gap. “It’s beyond understanding,” says Nasser Hussain of England’s decision to have only two slips. “It really is.”1st over: South Africa 2-1 (Elgar 0, Hamza 0) Anderson celebrated that wicket with a scowl, one which said: I’m 37 years old, coming back from a long-term injury, and you foppwits have asked me to bowl again after only 53.2 overs’ rest, so take your jaunty high fives and stick ‘em in your redacted.Jimmy Anderson strikes with his fourth ball. Markram whips around his pad and is given out LBW. He takes a review with him, having used one up in the hope the ball was missing leg stump. It wasn’t. That was a desperate review.What does he know?“Now now, I think there is some doom and gloom here,” says Tone White. “There is not that much difference between the teams, only one big score. If de Kock had gone for 35, say, England would be easily within striking distance of the SA total. Following the OBO yesterday, I had the impression the English bowlers were better than ok.”Never trust that rag. I do agree about de Kock – he was very lucky at the start of his innings – but you could say the same about England’s top scorer, Denly, who was dropped on 0. Ultimately England are being outplayed, again. They just aren’t very good. In fact, I’m not sure they’re that good. Credit where it’s due. While England didn’t exactly bat with life-affirming excellence, South Africa bowled quite brilliantly. Not just the big two, either. Dwaine Pretorius and especially Anrich Nortje sparked a dramatic collapse - the last seven wickets fell for 39 - with a blistering spell of old-ball bowling.That might just be out. Philander pegs back Archer’s off stump with a gorgeous legcutter to finish with pornographic figures of 14.2-8-16-4. South Africa lead by 103 and will win this game at a canter. 53rd over: England 181-9 (Archer 3, Anderson 0) “Re: the 50th over,” begins Adam Pervoe. “England anticipated a tie?”That or a seven-wicket win. It all depends on whether you speak scorecard.Meh. Broad fences a short one from Rabada straight to gully.52nd over: England 178-8 (Archer 0, Broad 2) “Hi Ron,” says Geoff Wignall. “I’ve noticed a couple of Lampard-Gerrard years comparisons you’ve made in recent months. As all football followers outside England and quite a few within it always knew, those should have been the Scholes years had he not been shunted onto the left wing because neither of the other two had his versatility. (If you doubt my word, ask Xavi.) Who, if anyone, do you reckon would be his current cricketing equivalent?”The obvious answer is Ben Foakes. But I think he’s more like Michael Carrick or Owen Hargreaves, understated and underappreciated. I suppose the closest comparison is Moeen, in that he has often been played out of position to accommodate more ostentatious talents. And now he has semi-retired.And another one goes by. Buttler edges a beautiful seaming lifter from Philander towards first slip, where de Kock es in front of van der Dussen to take a spectacular catch. That’s his sixth catch of the innings, equalling the South African record.51st over: England 176-7 (Buttler 12, Archer 0) Archer’s batting for England has been a letdown so far, in all forms. He is beaten by a cracking lifter from Rabada but then does extremely well to get on top of a venomous throat ball.50th over: England 176-7 (Buttler 12, Archer 0) Buttler is beaten twice by Philander. The first kept low the second lifted and seamed away. These are not easy batting conditions.“Easy to say from here, but bearing in mind the fragile form of the batting unit as well as the disruption to the training camp due to illness, I am surprised by the decision to bowl firstbat last,” says Patrick Treacy. “Were the conditions really that compelling to make it worth the risk? Background circumstances seemed to favour using the bowling attack on a fourth innings wicket while giving batting partnerships more chance to bed in before fielding in blazing heat all day.”I’d say it was emphatically the wrong decision – as most people observed at the time - but not a complete stinker. I suspect England misread the conditions and envisaged a 250370220100-3 type of game. 49th over: England 176-7 (Buttler 12, Archer 0) “It all feels so predictable, Rob,” says Guy Hornsby. “And not just Bairstow’s middle stump, but I agree he really did need the winter off. He still looks pretty blinkered, and there’s a risk he’ll really get into a big rut here. Pope will have a say in this series but we can’t expect a (hugely talented) young batsman to get us out of trouble. It starts, as they say, at the top. Once again, we let a side off the hook, something that’s even more common than our collapses. We aren’t a poor side, but we’re a potentially decent one making continually poor decisions. Something has to change, surely.”I’m not sure I agree with all of that. It’s this assumption of potential, based on increasingly thin evidence, that has created a lot of the problems England have had in the last 2-3 years. The culture of picking on status and potential rather than performance is pretty miserable. Sam Curran’s counter-attack is ended by a fine reaction catch. He turned a shortish ball from Rabada off the face of the bat towards short leg, where Zubayr Hamza reached down by his left ankle to take it superbly.48th over: England 173-6 (Buttler 12, Curran 16) “I like the idea of a Gerrard-Lampardification of the team but at least you knew they were the best midfielders in the country and that they were likely in decent form for their clubs,” says David Horn. “With Bairstow, I believe he was asked to get some red ball cricket under his belt - which he hasn’t done - and come back as a specialist batsman. Now, someone who got their runs in red ball cricket and plugged away in county cricket has been dropped after one Test to make way for someone who still can’t work out if he should be backwards or forwards and whether or not he should hit a straight one. It’s approaching 90s levels of selection comedy.”Crawley isn’t a middle-order batsman so I can understand the selection in that respect. But they should have had somebody other than Bairstow as the back-up middle-order batsman. England are still selecting him because of his form in 2016. And as we all know, the world was a very different place back then.47th over: England 171-6 (Buttler 12, Curran 15) A double bowling change, with Rabada coming on as well. He beats Buttler with a nasty seaming grubber. England are paying, in truth, for an indifferent (and occasionally unfortunate) bowling performance yesterday. This pair are probably their last realistic hope, and both are playing with the requisite counter-attacking intent. Buttler gets his second boundary by thumping Rabada through the covers.46th over: England 165-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 15) Vernon Philander returns after tea. His bowling figures (10-7-5-2) are already pretty erotic. In an hour’s time we could be looking at pure scorecard porn. Not if Curran has anything to do with it, mind you: he hits Philander for consecutive boundaries with a fine square drive and a thick edge along the ground.“I gather from the good folk on Guerrilla Cricket that Ed Smith is on the record as saying Foakes needs to win a Big Bash contract before he can be considered again for the Test team,” says Reverend Jim. “Is this the most disgraceful cricket-related utterance in history or only in the last fifty years?”No, but it might be the most satirical.Teatime reading, from an old friend45th over: England 157-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 7) Curran is beaten for pace as he attempts to hook Nortje. Playing for tea, 2019-style. The next ball is a snorter: full, seaming away and keeping a bit low as it zips past the edge. That was unplayable. England haven’t a prayer in the fourth innings on this pitch. A superb over from Nortje continues with a short ball that Curran fences short of the slips and through for four. It’s been a sizzling spell of bowling from Nortje, and it has put South Africa in complete control of the match. See you in 20 minutes for more Test-match batting, England-style.44th over: England 152-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 2) Buttler ignores a series of tempters outside off stump from Pretorius. England are playing for tea, which is five minutes away. I’d expect a ferocious counter-attack from Buttler and Curran after that, as it’s the only way England can get a first-innings lead. And by flip they need one.43rd over: England 151-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 1) Curran works Nortje off the hip to get off the mark. I think a few teams fancy that Curran can be bounced out, and South Africa are among them.42nd over: England 150-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 0) “I know there are illnesses etc but what is Bairstow doing within ten miles of the Test team?” says Andrew Hurley. “It’s amusing how every attack in the world only needs to target Bairstow’s stumps for between 5 and 10 balls and he’ll get out. Do you think he’s in the team as he threw a tantrum to Root?!”Ha, no, I think he’s there on perceived potential. I would have given him the winter off, at the very least, as two Tests isn’t nearly enough time to reset. It’s hard to justify - never mind warm to - the GerrardLampardification of the England Test team in recent years. 41st over: England 150-6 (Buttler 6, Curran 0) Nortje produces another Flintoff-to-Gilchrist beauty to beat the new batsman Sam Curran. South Africa have always produced raw, exciting, occasionally shambolic fast bowlers – Nantie Hayward, Andre Nel, the rest - and Nortje looks a worthy addition to the list. That’s his second consecutive wicket maiden.Spoiler alert: England have lost this game.Anrich Nortje has taken the big wicket! Ben Stokes chases a wide delivery from around the wicket that straightens to take the edge, and de Kock pouches a simple catch. It was a fine delivery but a fairly poor stroke from Stokes, who until then had played immaculately.40th over: England 150-5 (Stokes 35, Buttler 6) Buttler gets off the mark second ball with a delicious boundary, driven between short extra cover and mid-off when Pretorius overpitches. He almost falls later in the over, checking a stroke that lands just short of the bowler.39th over: England 143-5 (Stokes 34, Buttler 0) That dismissal takes Bairstow’s average this year to 19. England are in big trouble now.Bairstow drags a couple of thick inside-edges into the leg side off Nortje. He is, unsurprisingly, are bowling very straight in an attempt to consolidate Bairstow’s famous bowledLBW statistics. And he’s done it! Bairstow is cleaned up by a ball that keeps a fraction low and thuds into the off stump. He was back when he should have been forward, and was probably beaten for pace as well. His comeback lasted just six deliveries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d0a6d3bf5e32fc4abcf537ed140daf9c3087e6f/48_0_4972_2984/master/4972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70d481a0d4a5fd623347b19f1f6772ca","title":"welsh grand national leopardstown and kempton racing live","story":"On to Kempton (2.30) now for the Desert Orchid Chase. This is Christmas without the feast as Altior, who was due to run here, is absent with an abscess. Get well Soon, Altior. It’s just over half an hour to the Welsh National and Elegand Escape is all the rage for the race. A Bookmakers.tv spokesman said: “The market has sprung to life at Chepstow and the only horse the public want to be with at the front end is the hot favourite and last year’s winner Elegant Escape. “Colin Tizzard and Robbie Power were out of luck in yesterday’s feature but punters are convinced they’ll go one better today and last night’s 7-2 looks long gone as the top weight has fallen to 11-4 in places, while it would be no surprise to see him go off shorter still. The remainder of the field have largely been ignored but one at longer odds attracting support is Irish raider Space Cadet who has halved from 40-1 to 20-1 despite racing from out of the handicap.”Back to Leopardstown (1.45) for the Paddy Power Future Champions Novice Hurdle ... All eyes here are on favourite Abacadabras ... and he’s going well just behind the leaders on the home turn ... he’s coming to challenge Heaven Help Us at the last and runs out the winner. Abacadabras is a clumsy jumper and will need to improve in that sphere but he’s certainly got ability. Betfair were impressed and go 7-2 favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival from 6-1. Given his hurdling technique I would be looking elsewhere presently at those odds.See what you think here:Now off to Chepstow (1.35) for Coral Finale Juvenile Hurdle, a race that has been won by useful types in the past. Allmankind has gone off like Rudolph at the front of the reindeer posse ... far too free ... let’s see if he can keep up this pace up ... he’s gone further clear ... Cerberus is staying on ... commentator Mark Johnson has gone too soon again but the winner hadn’t and that was pretty impressive from Allmankind. That was a very good Cheltenham Festival Triumph Hurdle pointer. The winner is 8-1 for the Triumph from 16-1 with Betfair – that seems fair.Over to Kempton (1.20) for the Wayward Lad Novice Chase. Global Citizen leads into the straight but it’s wide open. Al Dancer is trying to get there as is Rouge Vif ... but Global Citizen holds on. Now you could have thrown Santa’s blanket over the first five home and they can’t all be good ... Betfair go 16-1 Global Citizen (from 33-1) for the Arkle Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival.Result:1 Global Citizen (David Bass) 8-1 2 Rouge Vif (G Sheehan) 11-2 3 Grand Sancy (H Cobden) 11-2 6 ran Make your mind up on the strength of the form. Here’s the finish:At Leopardstown (1.10) now it’s Chacun Pour Soi’s chance to strut his stuff in the Grade One Paddy’s Rewards Chase. He’s only run twice in four years but is an exciting prospect. Going well with four to go and leaps in the lead at the next ... he’s got a fight on his hooves now on the run-in ... A Plus Tard and the favourite battle it out and Rachael Blackmore’s mount gets up to pull off a surprise success. A Plus Tard now 6-1 from 33’s for the Champion Chase with Betfair.Here’s all the late action. Terrific ride by Blackmore:The top-class action is about to start with the exciting City Island set to make his chasing debut at Leopardstown in the Paddy Power Beginners Chase at 12.35 ... where he faces the former Champion Hurdle runner-up Melon. Hold on to your trilby, we’ll be busy ... Melon is 11-8 fav ... and City Island 2-1. That may look generous soon ... Cappucimix is down at the first ... Valdieu has now gone and Melon currently winning the jumping stakes against City Island, who has been slower over his obstacles ... City Island makes a shocking mistake and is virtually out of the race ... Melon also makes a very bad error at the last but gets up to beat Gallant John Joe in a fighting finish.City Island needs to go back to the schooling grounds ... and Melon is tough and clearly potentially useful over fences. He is unchanged with Betfair at 14-1 for the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham.Willie Mullins said of the winner: “I was very happy with the way he jumped early on, obviously he made a mistake at the last, but what particularly pleased me was the way he fought back when it looked like the game was up. He makes life difficult for himself, but he fought back well today.” He added on plans: “I’d imagine the Arkle is the likely target. He could come back here for the Dublin Racing Festival and will need more experience.”You can see all the action hereChris Cook is having a short Christmas break but he found time to meet Hollie Doyle for a quick chat on her stellar year, and talked with the female jockey of the year about weight-training, festive eating and getting her own back in the saddle. It’s a nice read before the action starts:The BBC is in for a tough time but they’re not helping by ditching (sorry again) their racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght. When news of his exit surfaced, some opined that it may be because he was out of touch with the new-fangled social meeja. In fact he was one of the first to embrace Twitter – even if with semi-colons. He’s at Chepstow today for the Welsh National and just posted this:Cyrname is likely to return to Ascot for his next appearance after finding stablemate Clan Des Obeaux too strong in the Ladbrokes King George VI Chase. Cyrname was a hot favourite for the Boxing Day showpiece, having inflicted a first career defeat over jumps on Nicky Henderson’s superstar chaser Altior at Ascot last month. However, he had to make do with the runner-up spot – beaten 21 lengths – as Clan Des Obeaux won the Kempton highlight for the second year in succession and provided Paul Nicholls with a record-breaking 11th victory in the race.The most heartwarming performance yesterday was Faugheen’s, in stuffing (sorry) Samcro and proving he’s still ‘Faugheen The Machine’. The pair’s long, drawn out duel was genuinely gripping and many won’t have seen it. Here’s the race in full ...... and here are the happy connections of the King George winner celebrating ... in McDonald’s!... and King Clan is well ...Yesterday, Paul Nicholls said he wouldn’t be surprised if the dual King George winner Clan Des Obeaux’s next appearance would be in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Well, the trainer’s had a change of mind:Three of the last seven runnings of the Welsh National have been postponed until January after their original Christmas slot succumbed to waterlogging, but this year’s renewal has somehow survived one of the wettest spells that any of us can remember and will take its traditional place as the focus of the British action this afternoon.The going at the Welsh track is not even heavy all round, with some patches of soft ground apparently clinging on at a few points on the circuit, but it will, as ever, be a thorough test for all concerned. Selections for the televised races at both Chepstow and Kempton Park, where the two-day Winter Festival meeting concludes, can be found here, and there are no non-runners anywhere on the ITV Racing schedule as yet.But there is also plenty to consider in Ireland too, where the most interesting runner on day two of Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting is surely Chacun Pour Soi in the two-mile Grade One chase at 1.10, the first of two Grade One events on the card.Willie Mullins’s seven-year-old is already the favourite for the Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March after just two runs for the stable last season, both of which saw him record impressive victories. It was his defeat of Defi Du Seuil at Punchestown, however, which shot him to the forefront of the Festival betting, as he cleared away from the JLT Novice Chase (and subsequent Tingle Creek) winner in the style of an exceptional chaser.The second Grade One at Leopardstown is a two-mile novice hurdle with an odds-on favourite in Gordon Elliott’s Abacadabras, who was beaten fairly readily by his stable companion Envoi Allen in the Royal Bond at Fairyhouse earlier this month, while the big betting race of the day in Ireland is the Paddy Power Chase at 2.55, in which a huge field will chase an equally impressive €200,000 prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6b5d085e9e6e1fa3b8fafe93b6bb71499637bb/0_1495_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766abf6df8b7b31eef9e2d30c32bf36a","title":"delightful sausage funniest things","story":"Sketch comedy double act Amy Gledhill and Chris Cantrill on the things that make them laugh the mostChris Cantrill: Cancel all your plans and seek out the undisputed queen of character comedy, Anna Mann.Amy Gledhill: We got tickets to watch our spirit guides Vic and Bob last year recording Big Night Out and I haven’t washed since.Chris: Modern Toss – A Decade in the Shithouse is a heap of dysfunctional fun.Chris: Probably my Insane Clown Posse T-shirt.

Back in October, a family left a production of Motown the Musical at Sunderland Empire after being asked to refrain from spiritedly singing along to its Berry Gordy hits. Your thoughts on that probably depend on whether you, too, can’t help belting out a big chorus, or whether your worst nightmare is an off-key hum coming from the seat behind you.The urge to join in is definitely getting stronger. After the success of singalong cinema events – The Sound of Music, Grease, The Greatest Showman – you can now go to special karaoke versions of hit musicals Six and Waitress, where you can sing along during the show, or get on stage afterwards with live musicians and belt out your favourite tunes.In the West End of London, feelings about more ad-hoc participation are mixed. I’m at the Aldwych theatre for Tina, the brilliant rollercoaster life story of Tina Turner pinned to infectious songs such as Proud Mary and Private Dancer. The pre-show welcome announcement reminds the audience to switch off their phones, then follows that by asking them to refrain from singing during the show. The man in the seat next to me groans. “You come to a show like this because you like to sing along,” he tells me. A woman in front turns around to say that she was nearly thrown out of another musical for singing.A coach party from Hayling Island in Hampshire have come on their annual trip to let their hair down. “This is the first time we’ve been told not to sing,” says Beverley Donaldson. “At We Will Rock You, everyone was singing along. It’s a shame really.” But Janice Esteban, queuing for the ladies’ in the interval, thinks differently. “I want to hear the performers,” she says. “If someone sings as badly as I do, it would ruin it. I wouldn’t inflict that on anybody. And if everybody stands up – my husband can’t stand up so he can’t see anything. You go to a concert to rock,” she says, “you go to the theatre to watch.”Back in the auditorium, as Tina’s second act ramps up with more 80s hits, I hear pockets of humming every time a chorus comes, and when the intro to Simply the Best kicks in, and Tsemaye Bob-Egbe appears as Turner in that red leather dress, the coach party can’t hold back. It’s only a minute later that the show turns into a mini-concert, and Bob-Egbe launches us all to our feet, now sanctioned to belt and bop freely. Maybe all the better for having had to hold it in.Up the road, the auditorium of the Shaftesbury theatre is packed for \u0026amp Juliet, a larky, high energy, occasionally lame but massively fun Shakespeare spinoff. It’s a jukebox musical based on the songs of Swedish pop maestro Max Martin. Even if you think you’re not a fan of ’NSync, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and the rest of his roster, you somehow know all the songs – this is perfect singalong territory.Behind me in the stalls, Brian Westbrook, in town from the US for a conference, is clapping, laughing and having a great night. “You have to be respectful of everybody else, and if you’re singing off-key maybe keep it down,” he says. “But if you’re having fun and enjoying it and the crowd’s going with it, I don’t see a problem.”“Part of theatre is what happens on stage but it’s also what happens in the audience,” he says. “A show like this was clearly written to be enjoyed. I think it’s completely appropriate to be dancing and having a good time.”Charlotte Bamford and David Bishop, in the bar in the interval, agree that the show itself sets the tone. “They interact with you from the beginning,” says Bamford. “I sang along the whole way through,” admits Bishop. “Sometimes I feel a bit nervous about participating, I don’t really like those audience engagement-type shows, whereas here I actually was singing along. We’re in the back row but I felt like I was in the front row.”The back row may offer some anonymity. In the actual front row, Anna Levanen and her friends are sticking to lip-syncing. “I wouldn’t sing along,” she says. “I think it’s disrespectful to the performers. It is a bit different in this kind of event where you really know all of the songs, but we are here to hear their voices.” Although the volume coming out of the speakers is so high, she points out, you probably wouldn’t hear her if she did sing.As we get to the finale, the crowd are revved up, and for the last couple of numbers the performers start egging us on to get up and join in. But now you can feel that stubborn English reserve. Even with so much energy buzzing in the auditorium, some bottoms take a long time to leave their seats. At which point I think: perhaps rather than sanctions on singing, it’s permission to let loose that we really need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d74fb48312da07d3419482b1a22f5eb1cb04e4f1/0_103_1532_919/master/1532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2e9a70eced7b8cb8b8fde9d0f980be4","title":"the witcher netflix games of thrones","story":"Despite sniffy reviews, Netflix’s drama is currently its most successful original show – heralding a slew of new fantasy showsFantasy drama-starved TV viewers, many still mourning the loss of HBO’s Game of Thrones, may have found a new obsession – the Netflix show The Witcher, which debuted on the streaming service last week.The show’s reception – with its audience if not with critics – may also give a boost to the producers and backers of a slew of fantasy shows set to hit TV screens over the next few years as eager executives hope to replicate the global smash of Game of Thrones.Based on a series by the Polish novelist Andrzej Sapkowski, the eight-episode The Witcher is currently listed as Netflix’s highest-rated original series on IMDb, a ranking that means it beat out Stranger Things, Peaky Blinders, Black Mirror, The Crown, Ozark and Haunting of Hill House.The fantasy show was created by Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, whose credits include The West Wing and Parenthood, and is filmed in Hungary, Poland and the Canary Islands. It concerns Geralt of Rivia, a medieval mutant monster hunter with supernatural abilities played by Henry Cavill, with a cast that includes a sorceress, Yennefer of Vengerberg, and a princess named Ciri.The show’s success surprised critics who compared it unfavorably with Game of Thrones, with the New York Times describing it as a generic version of George RR Martin’s sword, sorcery, sex and dwarfism epic, despite being derived from a character in a Polish science fiction magazine published in the mid-1980s.“Armies gathering in the south to attack northern kingdoms. Dragons threatened with extinction. A magic tree. Softcore nudity. Eastern European locations. The arbitrary circling about of the main characters to delay a prophesied meeting,” the reviewer began, before noting that the Witcher “is a big silent softy who agonizes over the monsters he dispatches”.But viewers have taken another opinion. Last weekend, The Witcher showed a rating of 9.110 from over 23,000 users, while #Witcher and #WitcherNetflix have trended on Twitter.At a minimum, the positive audience response to The Witcher confirms the entertainment hole that Game of Thrones left, and consumers’ desire to return to realms of epic fantasy, where princes and princesses and monsters abound.That is encouraging news to TV, film and streaming service production houses scrambling to fill the HBO hit’s absence after eight seasons with new, highly rendered fantasy epics.HBO and Martin have already confirmed several GoT spinoffs, while Amazon is set to spend close to $1bn to make a five-season series based on JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, which became a movie franchise monster.The Lord of the Rings retread – technically a prequel – is being made under tight control by Amazon with the approval of Tolkein’s family, who were paid a reported $250m for the rights. Few details have been confirmed beyond that there will be 20 episodes in the first season and Star Trek Beyond writers JD Payne and Patrick McKay would develop and serve as executive producers.Last month, Deadline confirmed that the retail giant had already ordered a second season.Beyond that, Netflix has purchased the rights and commissioned The Chronicles of Narnia as well as Cursed, a 10-part retelling of the legend of King Arthur through the perspective of the Lady of the Lake based on a forthcoming fantasy novel by Tom Wheeler."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd123eac0a445603cd01dbbc37dbfff48f252152/124_0_1307_784/master/1307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98fb5b2ec126dc2e9e9d86b819e12c84","title":"archaeologists discover remains of vast mayan palace","story":"Mayan remains in Mexico estimated to be over 1,000 years oldArchaeologists in Mexico have uncovered the remains of a vast Mayan palace over 1,000 years old, used by members of the elite, in an ancient city around 100 miles west of the tourist hotspot of Cancún.The building uncovered in Kulubá was 55 metres long, 15 metres wide and six metres high, and appears to have been made up of six rooms, a statement from the national archaeology institute said.It is part of a larger complex that also includes two residential rooms, an altar and a large round oven. Archaeologists have also uncovered remains from a burial site they hope forensic analysis of the bones could provide more clues about Kulubá’s Mayan inhabitants.The palace was in use during two overlapping eras of Mayan civilisation, in the Late Classical period between AD600 and AD900, and the Terminal Classical between AD850 and AD1050, said Alfredo Barrera Rubio, one of the lead archaeologists at the site.“We know very little about the architectural characteristics of this region, the northeast of Yucatán. So one of our main objectives, as well as the protection and restoration of cultural heritage, is the study of the architecture of Kulubá,” he said in a video made on the side.“This is just the start of the work. We are only just uncovering one of the largest structures on the site.” He hopes that as the work continues, it will become a natural attraction for visitors to the region, he added.The Mayans built one of the greatest civilisations of the western hemisphere, which flourished across central America including what is now southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras.Their cities boasted pyramid temples and huge stone buildings, and they used agriculture and metal work, developed sophisticated irrigation systems and invented a hieroglyphic writing system.But Mayan society suffered a precipitous and mysterious decline between AD800 and AD1000. Scientists have suggested war, climate, disease and politics as possible causes, although cities including Chichén Itzá – which the archaeological dig suggests controlled Kulubá – flourished longer.The conservation team are considering an bringing back some of the forest cover – cleared during earlier excavation work at older parts of the site – to protect some of the more delicate buildings from the elements.“One option which the site offers is using vegetation for conservation,” said Natalia H Tangarife, part of the conservation team.“This would mean reforesting specific sites, so that trees can provide protection from direct sunlight, wind and other elements, for those structures which still have some of the original paint colours.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d57e0d16f87bc7c9c08b725d3e9a0c2288071a6/0_603_6461_3877/master/6461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f64c00abd2e4049d8124bede92d3dc3b","title":"more than 235000 people have fled idlib region in syria says un","story":"Displacement follows two weeks of air and ground assaults on rebel strongholdMore than 235,000 people have fled from the Idlib region over the past two weeks, the UN has said, as attacks intensify on Syria’s final opposition stronghold.The mass displacement between 12 and 25 December has left the Maarat al-Numan area in southern Idlib “almost empty”, the UN said in a statement on Friday.Since mid-December, Russian-backed regime forces have pressed on with an assault against jihadists in southern Idlib, despite an August ceasefire deal and calls for de-escalation from Turkey, France and the UN.Airstrikes have increased as Russian-backed regime forces have advanced on the ground.Troops have seized dozens of towns and villages from the jihadists since 19 December, in clashes that have killed hundreds on both sides.The bombardment and fighting on the ground have amplified displacement from Maarat al-Numan and the nearby town of Saraqeb in southern Idlib, the UN said.“People from Saraqeb and its eastern countryside are now fleeing in anticipation of fighting directly affecting their communities next,” it said.Idlib is dominated by the country’s former al-Qaida affiliate, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whose leader urged jihadists and allied rebels to head to the frontlines and fight the “Russian occupiers” and the regime.About 3 million people live in the region, including many displaced by years of violence in other parts of Syria.Backed by Moscow, the regime launched an offensive against Idlib in April, killing about 1,000 civilians and displacing more than 400,000 people.Despite a ceasefire announced in August, the bombardment has continued, prompting Turkey to press for a fresh ceasefire agreement during talks in Moscow.Earlier this week, France called for an “an immediate de-escalation”, warning of deteriorating humanitarian conditions.The war in Syria has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 2011 with anti-government demonstrations that were brutally repressed by security forces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

The proposals come almost a year and a half after a “cross-agency” group, involving several government departments, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and the Garda, was set up to look at the problem. Scramblers and quad bikes are meant for off-road use and do not have a licence plate or tax disc. Those who ride them do not require a driver’s licence or insurance though you must be at least 16 to qualify for a licence to drive on a public road.Up to now, it has been legally unclear if offences under road traffic legislation – such as careless or dangerous driving – can apply in public parks and other green spaces. Latest figures provided by the RSA show there have been five deaths and 45 injuries involving at least one quad bike or scrambler between 2014 and 2018. The Department of Justice said it was agreed at a meeting of the cross-agency group on December 9th that the Department of Transport would assess whether “specific legislative amendments” proposed by the Garda can be implemented “and if so, how best to do this”.“An Garda Síochána have proposed changes to definitions within road traffic legislation, which they believe would widen their ability to apply road traffic provisions – such as the ability to seize and detain vehicles, or to prosecute for careless or dangerous driving – which are, generally, most appropriate for this form of antisocial behaviour,” a Department of Justice spokesman said. Consideration of the proposals include whether they have any unforeseen impacts on other areas of law.RegulationBut Jack Chambers, Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin West, who has raised the issue in the Dáil, said empowering gardaí with improved road safety legislation was only one part of the solution. “There is also the area of regulating how quads and scramblers are sold,” he said. “There is a vacuum there, there is no proper oversight, no registration or licensing for them being sold here. “There needs to be moves around restricting and regulating the actual sale of these bikes and that would help squeeze out a lot of the illegal use.”Mr Chambers said they can be used legitimately in designated motocross parks in a “controlled manner, insured and licensed but then you have the flip side, which is anarchy on our streets and in our green spaces.” Unless there is “a legislative , licensing and regulatory solution, things will remain the same or get worse”.Tommy Broughan, Independent TD for Dublin Bay North, said if the problem was happening “in a leafy south Dublin suburb it would have been addressed pronto.” “This issue has bedevilled us for maybe two decades,” he said. “The Government is not taking the deep concerns of the working class communities seriously – it is a gross discrimination.” The Department of Justice said it was agreed at this month’s cross-agency meeting that gardaí would also “explore further targeted enforcement measures” while the department itself would look into developing awareness campaigns targeting younger people “drawn to this behaviour”.“It should be noted that targeted enforcement measures have been introduced in a number of areas where quad bikes and scramblers were causing difficulties,” a department spokesman said.

File photograph: Tom HonanThe The number of public payphones in the Republic of Ireland continues to drop, with just 456 left, compared with almost 4,000 a decade ago.Payphone usage has declined dramatically in recent years because of the popularity of smartphones.In 2008, there were more than 3,500 payphones in the Republic of Ireland. The decline started when the company then trading as Eircom put almost 2,000 payphones out of service.In the past few years, more phone boxes have been removed across the country, with more than a dozen being removed in the past six months.An Eir spokesman said 21 payphones have been removed so far this year, with requests from councils and continued anti-social behaviour cited as the most common reasons for removal.There were on average 235 calls from payphones per day in September 2019, equating to on average 0.05 of a call from each payphone daily.Eir said if a payphone is used for less than one minute a day on average and if emergency services calls do not count for more than 30 seconds of each minute, it can remove it.The company is set to replace old payphones across Dublin with upgraded versions that will include wifi, interactive touchscreens and information services for tourists.Eir applied for planning permission earlier this year to upgrade the kiosks in more than 20 locations across the city.In a statement, Eir said it has agreed a programme with Dublin City Council to improve public payphones at selected locations in Dublin, subject to planning approval.“The proposed structures are open stand-alone kiosks designed to reduce instances of anti-social behaviour, improve street furniture and provide enhanced services to users including interactive, digital information points.”Dublin City Council said a decision due date on Eir’s application is January 10th, 2020.“Twenty-plus planning applications have been submitted to Dublin City Council for the replacement of existing telephone kiosks with new telephone kiosks.‘Steady decline’Independent councillor for Dublin City Council Mannix Flynn said: “We have seen the steady decline of payphones in Dublin city as they have become sites of anti-social behaviour in recent years.Mr Flynn said he is concerned the type of technology being proposed in the more than 20 new payphone kiosks will date too quickly.“We’re going to have 5G and even higher speed broadband coming down the track soon so is there really a need in this day and age for wifi hubs when tourists do everything on their phones?” he said.“They will end up being vandalised or falling into disrepair and then we are left with the same issue.“We risk being left with a whole load of boxes with advertising and product placement.”Mr Flynn said there are very few public conveniences in Dublin city centre and questioned whether this is the best use of the boxes.“Why are we giving planning permission to a telecommunications company when we don’t have one public lavatory in the city centre?“It is a question of priorities.” – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4125354.1577439254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"last call latest irish phonebook could be the final edition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe number might be up for the State’s printed telephone directories. File photograph: Getty ImagesThe number might be up for the State’s printed telephone directories, as the current 20192020 phonebook could be the final edition ever.ComReg, the telecom regulator, has signalled it favours removing the requirement on Eir to make a printed version of the directory available for landline subscribers in future.Fewer than 2,400 copies of the latest phonebook have been ordered by members of the public since last year’s decision by the regulator that a free printed local-area directory would no longer be provided to every subscriber.ComReg has revealed that Eir received just 2,399 requests for the phonebook this year, which ultimately resulted in 2,354 copies being provided.The vast majority of people who requested a directory collected it free of charge from an Eir store of their choice, with only 298 paying the €4.70 charge to have it delivered to their home.Eir has calculated that it cost €39.02 to print each copy.While Eir was permitted to charge a distribution fee for delivery of the directory, ComReg ruled that it could not impose charges on subscribers for the cost of printing and packaging the phonebooks.ComReg said it regarded the number of requests for the directory as “very low”.Consumers were notified earlier this year that the 20192020 edition of the phonebook would only be delivered if they specifically requested a copy.Eir had sought to change policy on the basis that the provision of a printed directory had become uneconomical due to falling advertising revenues and increased costs.The company described the phonebook as “obsolete and unnecessary”.Although the figure is down from €1.4 million in 2014, Eir estimated the total cost of providing the 20192020 edition at €109,256.Where once several million copies of directories were printed annually, ComReg said only 2,800 of the latest edition were printed, including 890 for the 01 Dublin area.A survey of people who ordered a copy of the 20192020 directory revealed that the vast majority (83 per cent) were over 65 years of age, while 78 per cent had never used an online directory.One-third did not have internet access in their home.Asked about the possibility of a printed telephone directory no longer being available in future, just over one-third said they would find this situation difficult, while 21 per cent said they would use an online directory and 19 per cent said they would continue to use the “old” 20192020 phonebook.Force of habitComReg said the results showed that a significant portion of people who ordered a phonebook continued to use it primarily for reasons of convenience and habit.It said there may also be a lack of awareness among such users about alternatives services such as free online directories and directory enquiry services.ComReg has now launched a public consultation on whether it should cease requiring printed phonebooks to be made available.The regulator said it believed that there was no longer a need to impose such an obligation on Eir as universal service provider.“ComReg is of the preliminary view that there are now sufficient affordable and accessible alternatives for sourcing phone numbers that could serve all age profiles and areas in the State appropriately,” the regulator stated.ComReg said the online directory had the advantage of being more accessible when people were “on the move”, as well as being free and updated more regularly than the printed phonebook version.The regulator noted the demand for directory enquiry services is also declining, with Eir reporting that revenue from its operator services had fallen by 33 per cent to €5 million in the year to June 30th, 2019, as a result of reduced call volumes to its 11811 directory enquiries service.It pointed out that a survey it commissioned last year showed that the internet was the most popular source for finding both personal and business phone numbers, at 56 per cent and 83 per cent respectively.The survey also highlighted how 83 per cent of members of the public stated they would be unwilling to pay for a printed phone directory.Eight of the 28 EU member states currently provide only electronic directories."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4124938.1577386532!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"record 900 000 passport applications in 2019 94 000 from uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMonthly  applications for Irish passports exceeded 100,000 in January, March, April and May 2019. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien A record breaking 900,000 passports have been issued this year, up more than 63,000 on 2018. As in previous years, there was a significant number of applicants – more than 94,000 – from Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales. Applications exceeded 100,000 a month in January, March, April and May. At the height of demand more then 5,800 applications were submitted from around the world in a single day. Brexit saw a surge in demand for passports from Irish citizens living in the UK. The tallies for February and March cleared 11,000 each month coming up to a Brexit deadline. October also saw a surge to 7,208 ahead of another proposed – but missed – Halloween deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.Of the applications in 2019, 84,972 came from Dublin, while the county with the least number of applicants was Fermanagh, at 627. In all, almost 19,000 applications came from the six counties that make up Northern Ireland. The oldest online applicant was 101 and the youngest just five days old. The most popular baby girls’ names were Grace, Emily and Anna, while Jack, James and Noah topped the baby boys’ list. The most popular surname worldwide on applications was Murphy. CitizenshipThe number of people applying for citizenship through Foreign Births Registration continues to grow with more than 29,000 applications in 2019 and over 16,000 applications processed. This is the highest number ever registered in a single year. The Passport Office said it had revamped its service and that faster turnaround times included five working days for simple renewals, 10 working days for complex renewals and 20 working days for first-time applicants, excluding postage delivery time.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said it was another “bumper year” for the passport service. Mr Coveney thanked passport office staff who he said offer “a modern, secure and efficient” service. “If you need to renew your passport, I encourage you to do so online and in the off-peak period, to ensure the shortest possible renewal time,” he said.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA The Taoiseach has said he will not dismiss the idea of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, but insisted the UK must pay for it.British prime minister Boris Johnson and the Democratic Unionist Party have spoken in favour of the idea. Last week Mr Johnson described it as a “very interesting idea”, adding: “Watch this space.”Leo Varadkar said he had discussed the idea with Mr Johnson recently, revealing he told the prime minister it was “worth examining”.But the Taoiseach said he had also told Mr Johnson he would expect the UK to pay for it.“At which point he suggested, ‘no, no, the EU is going to pay for it’,” Mr Varadkar said.“So that’s definitely not going to happen, because neither Northern Ireland or Scotland are going to be in the EU. But it was kind of half serious, half joking in a way.“But all messing aside, I do think at the very least a high-level engineering assessment should be done as to whether it is a viable proposal.”Other parties have been less enthusiastic about the idea, with Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken saying investment was urgently needed in Northern Ireland’s infrastructure first.Mr Varadkar said: “I know people dismiss these things out of hand, but they used to dismiss the Channel Tunnel as well — the idea of building a tunnel between France and Britain — and I know what I see when I see a bridge tunnel between Denmark and Sweden, when you fly over New Orleans and you see 110 miles of bridge, it’s extraordinary,” he said.“I think we need to at least check out is this viable in engineering terms and how much money it would cost to do.”However Mr Varadkar said he is more interested in talking to Mr Johnson about other projects the two nations could work on together, such as a high-speed rail link connecting Dublin, Belfast and Cork, and better connections to the north west.He suggested hourly trains between the cities as well as improving the A5 road to Derry and Donegal. Mr Varadkar said he was also interested in the idea of a cross-border university, involving the Ulster University campus at Magee in Derry with Letterkenny IT, as well as the greenway projects and the Ulster Canal.“There are actually loads of really good projects we could do together that might not cost as much and would definitely be more feasible than a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland,” he said.“But in my pursuit of those ones I’m not going to dismiss the one that the prime minister’s particularly keen on.” - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Road collisions are one of the biggest killers of young people. You are far more likely to be killed in a road accident than in a terrorist attack.”  Speeding accounted for more than four out of five detected motoring offences in 201819, the RAC analysis found.  Some 2.39 million drivers were caught speeding in England and Wales last year, which is a  four per cent increase on the previous 12 months and a 37 per cent rise compared with 201112.A total of 2.84 million motoring offences were recorded in 201819, meaning speeding accounted for 84 per cent. The vast majority (97 per cent) of speeding incidents involved drivers being caught by camera.Steve Gooding, the RAC Foundation director, said: Where limits are properly signposted and clearly feel right for the road in question, motorists have no excuse for going faster.But that means highway authorities also have a responsibility to make sure the limits they set are appropriate and to avoid instances where the limit repeatedly bounces up and down along a single stretch.Department for Transport figures show 186 people were killed and 1,505 seriously injured in crashes on Britain\u0027s roads in 2018 in which a vehicle exceeding the speed limit was a contributory factor.In response, a Government spokesperson said: “The Government is delivering on the people’s priorities by putting 20,000 extra police officers on the streets.“There are tough penalties and rigorous enforcement in place for those who speed.

and the all-time record of close to $20,000 in 2017 - but is a significant improvement from the start of the year, when bitcoin was trading below $4,000.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe seasonal boost was predicted earlier this month, after research from digital currency exchange SFOX\u0026nbsprevealed that bitcoin has experienced positive market movements in the build-up to US holidays.Similar price increases occurred in the run up to the Fourth of July holiday earlier this year, as well as Labour Day in September and Thanksgiving in November.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

Regardless of which forces are really driving bitcoin\u0027s holiday behaviour, it seems as though bitcoin remains sensitive to major US holidays for the time being.Other cryptocurrencies also experienced positive price movements over the weekend, including ether\u0026nbsp(ethereum), XRP (ripple) and bitcoin cash. These altcoins are even more prone to huge price swings than the notoriously volatile bitcoin.Historically this has been a time when traders do look at altcoins and therefore volatility may increase, Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based cryptocurrency firm Luno, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Analysis of the latest price increase led some cryptocurrency analysts to predict further gains over the coming days.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes.

In exchange for a payment, whether in cash, supplies or services, a TV show or a film would prominently display a brand-name product.Then there was virtual product placement. Products or logos would be inserted into a show during editing, thanks to computer-generated imagery.Now, with the rise of Netflix and other streaming platforms, the practice of working brands into shows and films is likely to get more sophisticated. In the near future, according to marketing executives who have had discussions with streaming companies, the products that appear on screen may depend on who is watching.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn other words, a viewer known to be a whiskey drinker could see a billboard for a liquor brand in the background of a scene, while a teetotaler watching the same scene might see a billboard for a fizzy water company.Streaming services could also drop in brand-name products based on when a show is being watched. Someone who watches a streaming show in the morning could see a carton of orange juice within a character’s reach, while a different viewer watching the same thing in the afternoon could see a can of soda.Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 40.

With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display.

One of his gang members slaps a painting with his hands that are covered in red paint, but in the next shot, the handprints have disappeared from the artwork.Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, flies back to Hollywood on a Boeing 747. But it would have been a 707. The film was set in 1969 and the 747 went into service in January 1970.Dustin Hoffman’s character drives in the wrong direction across the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on his way to Berkeley, California. He is travelling on the top deck of the bridge for traffic going from  California to San Francisco.There is a continuity issue at breakfast when Julia Roberts’s character takes a bite out of a croissant. She’s in the hotel room with her co-star Richard Gere, but when the camera pans back to her, it transforms into a pancake. Then when she takes a second bite out of the pancake, there is only one bite mark in it.529 North by Northwest (1959)One of the children playing an extra in Alfred Hitchcock’s film covers his ears a few seconds before Eva Marie Saint’s character unexpectedly fires a gun at Cary Grant’s character in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria.Bullet holes can be seen in the walls of the apartment where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson’s characters go to get a briefcase, but it’s before the shoot-out has happened.729 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)John Connors Cessna’s plane numbers keep changing in the film. When he is in the hanger on the runway it is N3035C, but once it’s flying, the numbers change to N3413F.829 The Wizard of Oz (1939)Judy Garland isn’t wearing her iconic ruby red slippers in the scene where the trees pelt Dorothy and the Scarecrow with apples. Instead, she can be seen wearing plain black shoes.The baby that Bradley Cooper holds while adapting to civilian life after the Iraqi War is plastic. In fact, it looked so fake, even he admitted it was “nuts”.When computer expert David Levinson, played by Jeff Goldblum, is throwing a tantrum in the hanger housing the captured alien craft, he knocks over a bin that is labelled “Art Dept”. Clearly, a set designer left it there by mistake.1129 The Fast and the Furious (2001)In a scene when Jesse and Tran race, Tran is wearing a shirt with sleeves, but in the next shot he’s in a tank top. Didn’t anybody notice when they edited it?1229  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)We were always told that Harry Potter had his mother’s blue eyes. But when we see Lily Potter as a child, she has brown eyes. As a group of stormtroopers enter a control room, one of them accidentally bangs his head on a door. The actor responsible, Laurie Good, couldn’t believe it made it into the final film.  1429 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)There is a crew member wearing a cowboy hat and looking out to sea behind Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow on the pirate ship. 1529 Quantum of Solace (2008)A street cleaner behind Daniel Craig’s James Bond is pretending to sweep the road but is holding his broom several inches off the ground.1629 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)When Bianca accidentally shoots a gym teacher with an arrow, an extra, who is playing a student, runs off to get urgent help – but once she thinks she is out of shot, she stops and looks back at the camera.There is a modern car in the background of a big battle scene. Considering the film is set in the 13th century, it’s hard to imagine how it stayed in the final cut. Leonardo DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand while filming a scene in which he slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass. But rather than shout “cut”, he carried on in character. Tarantino liked it so much that he kept it in the film.Many of the mistakes are related to the film’s 1990s time period. These include computers using a wrongly dated version of Windows and Carol Danvers’s memories being jogged by a Nirvana song that wasn’t out until after she left Earth. Toby McGuire’s Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane from a group of attackers. He throws them through a set of windows before he kisses her upside down in the rain. But during their romantic embrace, the windows behind her are perfectly intact. As Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) dies one rainy evening, he releases a dove into a clear, blue sky. It is a lovely symbolic act but slightly dampened by this continuity error. Ridley Scott finally fixed this and other mistakes with his 2007 Final Cut.John Carpenter’s slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis was set in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois, but all the cars have Californian number plates and there are shots of palm trees, as the film was shot in Southern California.At the end of the cult film, Data tells news reporters that the octopus was really scary, but this actually refers to a deleted scene.

But James Cameron kept it in the film because it was funny. The blockbuster featured about 33 mistakes, including a scene in which lead actor Chris Pratt talks to co-star Bryce Dallas Howard without his mouth moving. In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.The Tim Burton-directed superhero film has multiple mistakes, but a major one happens in the scene when Joker and his crew deface paintings at a museum. One of his gang members slaps a painting with his hands that are covered in red paint, but in the next shot, the handprints have disappeared from the artwork.Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, flies back to Hollywood on a Boeing 747. But it would have been a 707. The film was set in 1969 and the 747 went into service in January 1970.Dustin Hoffman’s character drives in the wrong direction across the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on his way to Berkeley, California. He is travelling on the top deck of the bridge for traffic going from  California to San Francisco.There is a continuity issue at breakfast when Julia Roberts’s character takes a bite out of a croissant. She’s in the hotel room with her co-star Richard Gere, but when the camera pans back to her, it transforms into a pancake. Then when she takes a second bite out of the pancake, there is only one bite mark in it.529 North by Northwest (1959)One of the children playing an extra in Alfred Hitchcock’s film covers his ears a few seconds before Eva Marie Saint’s character unexpectedly fires a gun at Cary Grant’s character in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria.Bullet holes can be seen in the walls of the apartment where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson’s characters go to get a briefcase, but it’s before the shoot-out has happened.729 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)John Connors Cessna’s plane numbers keep changing in the film.

In fact, it looked so fake, even he admitted it was “nuts”.When computer expert David Levinson, played by Jeff Goldblum, is throwing a tantrum in the hanger housing the captured alien craft, he knocks over a bin that is labelled “Art Dept”. Clearly, a set designer left it there by mistake.1129 The Fast and the Furious (2001)In a scene when Jesse and Tran race, Tran is wearing a shirt with sleeves, but in the next shot he’s in a tank top.

Considering the film is set in the 13th century, it’s hard to imagine how it stayed in the final cut. Leonardo DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand while filming a scene in which he slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass. But rather than shout “cut”, he carried on in character. Tarantino liked it so much that he kept it in the film.Many of the mistakes are related to the film’s 1990s time period. These include computers using a wrongly dated version of Windows and Carol Danvers’s memories being jogged by a Nirvana song that wasn’t out until after she left Earth. Toby McGuire’s Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane from a group of attackers. He throws them through a set of windows before he kisses her upside down in the rain. But during their romantic embrace, the windows behind her are perfectly intact. As Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) dies one rainy evening, he releases a dove into a clear, blue sky. It is a lovely symbolic act but slightly dampened by this continuity error.

In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

APTaking Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit “Mary’s Boy Child” and singing it in medley with new song “Oh My Lord”, Boney M’s No 1 hit combined Christmas carol-like harmonies with Euro disco, steel drums and a reggae sensibility. It might sound disastrous – but somehow it works. AP“He’s gone2,000 milesIs very far,” sings Chrissie Hynde, above a twanging guitar riff in “2,000 Miles”, her serpentine melody stretching each syllable into several. You could easily assume it’s about two separated lovers, but it was actually written for the band’s original guitar player, James Honeyman-Scott, who died of a drug overdose a year earlier at the age of 25. The song is desperately bleak – as is the case with all the best Christmas songs – but with a note of festive hopefulness too. “The children were singingHe’ll be back at Christmas time.” AP418 15) Rockin\u0027 Around the Christmas Tree – Brenda LeeBrenda Lee was just 13 years old when she made herself a rockabilly legend thanks to the recording of this party classic. It always reminds me of scenes in The Santa Clause (one of the best ever Christmas films) where the jaunty number was heavily featured, along with seminal holiday movie Home Alone. RO518 14) Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow! – Dean MartinFew Christmas songs are as cosy as this one. Dean Martin’s smooth, rich voice is as warming as a good glass of whisky paired with sweeping, romantic strings and a chirpy flute, “Let it Snow!” conjures up images of stockings hanging up over the chimney, a Christmas tree glinting with baubles, and a frost-tinted window with snow falling outside. RO618 13) Walking in the Air – The Snowman  Peter AutyThough Aled Jones tends to get the credit for this haunting masterpiece, it is actually the voice of choirboy Peter Auty that appears in the climactic scene of the wordless 1982 animation The Snowman. He wasn’t credited though, and when his voice broke and Jones’s version reached number five in the UK charts, he was almost written out of history. In truth, though, whichever version you hear, the song’s sweeping grandeur is goosebumps-inducing. AP718 12) Peace on Earth Little Drummer Boy – David Bowie Bing CrosbyRecorded for Bing Crosby’s TV special Merrie Olde Christmas, and framed around a strange scripted exchange of banter between the two, this mash-up only came about because Bowie hated the song, “Little Drummer Boy”, that he had been asked on the show to sing. So songwriters Ian Fraser and Larry Grossman, alongside the show’s scriptwriter, cobbled together “Peace on Earth” to serve as a counterpoint, while Crosby performed the intended song. They recorded the resulting medley after less than an hour of rehearsal, and five weeks later, Crosby died. AP“Eartha Kitt is the sexiest woman in the world. You don’t write Christmas songs that are sexy. How are we going to do that?”This Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1018 9) I Believe in Father Christmas – Greg LakeThis Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1118 8) It\u0027s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year – Andy WilliamsAndy Williams’ classic brings to mind the kind of big, brash Christmas’s you see in American films – lots of presents, blazing fireplaces and a huge feast – but also plays heavily on the importance of spending time with your loved ones. It consistently appears in the top 10s of Christmas song rankings, and more than 50 years in, the 1963 staple shows no signs of wearing out. RO1218 7) \u0027Stop the Cavalry – Jona LewieIt was “just another anti-war song” until Jona Lewie threw a kazoo into the mix. The English singer-songwriter never intended “Stop the Cavalry” to become a Christmas single, but the festive mention in the line “I wish I was at home for Christmas”, along with the addition of a Salvation Army brass band and tubular bell, was enough to convince listeners.1318 6) Driving Home for Christmas – Chris ReaIn 1978, Rea thought it was all over. His record contract was done, and his manager had just told him he was quitting. Rea wanted to get home from London’s Abbey Road studios to Middlesborough, but his record company wouldn’t pay for a ticket.Sinatra’s version of this classic Christmas song opens on his isolated vocals before gradually introducing the swooning choir and tender strings section. And the lyrics: “Have yourself a merry little ChristmasMake the Yuletide gay  From now on your troubles will be miles awayHere we are as in olden daysHappy golden days of yoreFaithful friends who are dear to us  Gather near to us once more.” RO1518 4) All I Want for Christmas is You – Mariah CareyGeorge Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on this song, where the narrator looks back with sadness on a past relationship. As with “Fairytale of New York”, you have an upbeat, cheerful rhythm and chirpy instrumentation, against the melancholy of unrequited love in the lyrics, with the suggestion that it was given away too hastily (“This year, to save me from tearsI’ll give it to someone special”). RO1718 2) Fairytale of New York – The PoguesSome of the best songs combine uplifting instrumentation that contrasts with lyrics that can be downright miserable, and such is the case for “Fairytale of New York”. It has none of the sickly sweet sentimentality of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” or Wham!’s “Last Christmas”.Richard (Dick) Smith was suffering from tuberculosis, an illness which had plagued him since a child, from his bed in a sanatorium in Philadelphia. Gazing longingly out of his window at the snow, he wrote a poem describing all the things he would do when he was well again. He was inspired by the views of people playing in the park across the street from his family home on Church Street, where he’d lived with his mother, brother and two sisters. His father had died when he was a child. 118 18) Happy Xmas (War is Over) – John Lennon and Yoko OnoThere’s a caveat to the optimistic message of the song’s title. “War is over,” sing a choir of children over festive tambourines, but only, they add, “If you want it.” Having analysed the success of his previous single, “Imagine,” the former Beatle noted, “Now I understand what you have to do: Put your political message across with a little honey.” On this, an anti-Vietnam war protest song wrapped up in sleigh bells, strings and an anthemic melody, he does just that. APTaking Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit “Mary’s Boy Child” and singing it in medley with new song “Oh My Lord”, Boney M’s No 1 hit combined Christmas carol-like harmonies with Euro disco, steel drums and a reggae sensibility.

So I think no one is going to be intentionally hurtful.But by the same token, they’re not necessarily going to be completely politically correct or be aware of political correctness.Last year, McGowan\u0026nbspsaid he was absolutely fine\u0026nbspwith radio stations bleeping the word out.Fairytale of New York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspGavin and Stacey\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes.

Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Another said:\u0026nbspEven if it offends just one person\u0026nbspthen that’s one person too many.Other viewers didn\u0027t see the harm in using the word.Jones defended the use of the word, arguing that the moment stayed true to the characters.She said: Characters in Gavin \u0026amp Stacey are kind and big-hearted, I believe.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Citing Japan\u0027s heavy dependence on oil imports from the region, Mr Suga added that “it is extremely important to secure the safe navigation of Japan-affiliated ships”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDespite being a US ally, Japan\u0027s troop dispatch is not part of a US-led coalition protecting Middle East waterways, apparently an attempt to maintain neutrality in a show of consideration to Iran.Under the plan, Japan will send about 260 Maritime Self-Defence Force personnel with a destroyer and a pair of P-3C reconnaissance aircraft, mainly for intelligence-gathering in the Gulf of Oman, the Arabian Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Monks wearing solar filter glasses watch the ring of fire solar eclipse at the Gaden monastery in a Tibetan colony in Teginkoppa, IndiaA participant in a Darth Vader costume jumps into the water during the 110th edition of the \u0027Copa Nadal\u0027 (Christmas Cup) swimming competition in Barcelona\u0027s Port Vell.

Whoever isn\u0027t ready to take a risk for the path he believes in will never win.Netanyahu rushed off stage as Israel intercepts rocketAmid Israel’s worst political impasse rival Mr Saar, a former education and interior minister, had managed to garner some support from a handful of Likud backbenchers who have said it is time for fresh leadership.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To make that happen, Blue and White must achieve a decisive outcome that will extricate us from both political deadlock and a path of corruption.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

His supporters have tried to paint Mr Saar as part of the same conspiracy.Both Netanyahu and Gantz said they wanted to create a unity government, but fought over Mr Netanyahu’s position as prime minister.Although Mr Saar was widely expected to lose the primaries, as Likud’s leader, he would likely have a better chance of creating a national unity government with Gantz’s Blue and White party after the March elections.Recent polls also show that with Saar as leader, Likud would make a more powerful bloc with its natural ultra-Orthodox and nationalist allies.Some 116,048 Likud members are eligible to vote in the party primary.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan.

He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care? Forced into a life of domestic servitude, Haiti’s child slavesThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolThe importance of a solid work ethic was engrained into me at a young age. However, I remember the luxury of choice: I knew I could say no. Esperence knows he cannot.\u0026nbspAutumn: Mamoke, aged 10, has never set foot in a classroom. Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He’s hanging on to stitch up the leadership for hard-left candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey.Some of his supporters set up a Twitter campaign called #JeremyWasRight!What planet are they on  They just suffered the biggest battering for almost a century.Let me spell it out for them. You were wrong.Wrong to block Brexit. Wrong to present a manesto costing billions. And wrong to ask Britain to vote for an unelectable old leftie.But none of the candidates to replace Corbyn seem to understand why they suffered such a crushing defeat.Keir Starmer praised Corbyn’s “radicalism” and said Labour should build on his disastrous approach.And let’s not forget he sat in Corbyn’s top team as decent MPs were driven out and the party was poisoned by racism and extremism.Emily Thornberry launched her campaign by suggesting Labour should have blocked the election. The rest of us thought they needed a leader the country could vote for.Along with Rebecca Long-Bailey and David Lammy, she nominated Corbyn for the leadership — and that should rule all of them out of replacing him.There’s another long list of candidates for deputy leader. The most ridiculous has to be Richard Burgon.The Leeds MP said: “The mistake we made was being persuaded that people did not quite want to get Brexit done as their top priority.”Can someone provide a translation Labour lefties are blaming anyone but themselves. But the public won’t begin listening until they know you have listened to them.Andthey carry on like this, Boris can look forward to years ahead in No. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well done!THE Queen has not had the best of years.But what a comfort her great- grandchildren must be.While we all keep our fingers crossed for Prince Philip in hospital, what a wonderful sight to see young Prince George making her smile.Let’s hope Philip makes a speedy recovery and the Queen’s  turns out to be an annus mirabilis.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Jo said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without.We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just dont know how long we can last like this.At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we cant afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.This comes as another young family were forced into debt and had to rely on handouts after having a five-week wait to receive Universal Credit.A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: We are in contact with Centre and have met a number of times to explain that we need to make up for the loss of the sports pitch.We have explained this position several times and what we’re doing to try and resolve it.The Council is supportive of the farm, and as landlord would be agreeable to the proposal.However, any sub-lease or change of use is subject to the necessary permissions and whilst we are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, there is a process to follow when someone wants to change the use of a sports field.We are working with Sport England to try to resolve this to allow their objection to the plans to be lted.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story.

Close the stadium for a match — or at the very least the stand where the abuse came from.Racism at grounds was far worse in the past. But it has spiked again and can be wiped out with severe enough deterrents.We don’t buy, though, that these morons are emboldened by politicians.The Left seeks to blame Boris Johnson for everything.So they pretend his use of words like “piccaninnies”, in a  satirical attack on white leaders posing as colonial masters, was motivated by racism.No one who knows Boris thinks that of him.No one but the racists themselves are to blame for the Spurs outrage.Our leagues must stop wringing their hands and take forceful action.THE defiance of American death-crash driver Anne Sacoolas is outrageous.She accepts that she killed teenager Harry Dunn while driving on the wrong side of the road in the UK. But her lawyer says a prosecution and potential jail term is “not a proportionate response”.Britain is not a banana republic.Our justice system is as advanced as America’s. It is for our courts, not a suspect or her lawyer, to decide what is proportionate.Accidents can have consequences.Mrs Sacoolas will not want to leave her kids.Neither should she want them living with the knowledge their mum killed a young man and fled into hiding.Our Government must pursue extradition and the US must grant it — as we doubtless would were the roles reversed.ED Miliband won’t need long to diagnose the cause of four Labour election defeats in a row.He was behind three of them.Brown, the hapless oaf, lost in .Miliband then took the party to the left, gting the Tories their  winAnd Ed was just getting started.He sold party memberships for £ and the hard-Left piled in, made the toxic fool Corbyn leader and two more defeats followed.Who would now bet against a fth, given the new leadership candidates The latest, Islington snob Emily Thornberry, has a distaste for working-class people which is mutual — as White Van Man Dan Ware makes clear today.And in branding our PM — newly elected by million voters — a “feckless, lying charlatan”, Thornberry promises five more years of the same juvenile abuse putting millions off Labour.Not learning much, are they THREE years of furious political ision.Wasn’t it fantastic when it stopped To all Sun readers — Left or Right, Leavers or Remainers — have a fabulous Christmas! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But sadly the newest member, ArchieHarrison Mountbatten-Windsor, won’t be there.He will be with his parents Harry and Meghan somewhere in Canada, celebrating away from the royals.That’s a real shame, because with his upbeat presence Harry would have got the Queen laughing over the turkey.I watched the boys grow up, and you couldn’t then get a cigarette paper between them.It will sadden the Queen that Harry is not there and that he doesn’t seem to get on with his brother any more.As a nation, we have huge rts to heal over Brexit. In her traditional Christmas Day speech the Queen will ask the country to come together and heal the wounds.I’m sure one of her priorities in the New Year will not only be to unite the country, but to bring together her beloved grandsons and their wives.But it’s the Epstein outrage that did most to threaten the House of Windsor this year.The Queen must have been horried to watch the car- crash interview Andrew gave to the BBC.With his arrogance and lack of preparation, Andrew — a Falklands War hero — turned what he hoped could have been his redemption into a nightmare.The Queen, with the advice of the Prince of Wales, acted swtly. Andrew was stripped of his royal duties. The institution has to be protected at all times.Of course, it would have been hard for the Queen to do all this, but she did it with calm and with grace, the hallmarks our redoubtable, -year-old monarch.We should not forget this. This remarkable woman continues to serve us when many would have crumbled.You will not hear the slightest grumble from our Queen.Thank heavens for that.While it seems the royals can do no right, the Queen carries on as normal. She rides her Fell pony most weekends and watches the racing on TV and gets excited when she picks a winner.Her family looks to her at times of ision and uncertainty — and so does the nation.The country is polarised over Brexit and one of the things the Queen wants to see is the isions healed and for people to come together in the New Year.Since he retired, the Duke of Edinburgh has lived in Sandringham, so the Queen is rattling around in her apartments with just servants to talk to. She can’t confide in them like she can the Duke. The scandal that has engulfed Prince Andrew will have saddened her so much. But she won’t abandon her son. She loves him.All families face rts and scandals at one time or another. The Windsors are no dferent. Their story is all about continuity, both for the nation and the Royal Family.So the Queen will have loved the recently released new photographs of herself with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George preparing a Christmas pudding for charity.It was a royal flush, the Monarch with three generations of heirs. I will be at Sandringham at am tomorrow to photograph theQueen and her family as they arrive at St Mary Magdalene Church.She will pray for the strength to carry on through what are likely to be bumpy roads ahead.And bumps there will be. The Andrew scandal is far from over and  could be a pivotal year for the Duke, who has yet to face the FBI.So when you watch the Queen give her Christmas message tomorrow afternoon, spare a thought for someone who has served this country so dutully and for so long.An amazing woman of true decency and honour.We remain lucky to have her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So we bought her a special Gourmet Dog Christmas Dinner made of . . . yes, turkey. And goose.And our reward for this kindness is to have her lying at our feet all day farting like a wizard.The clouds of gas are so toxic there are flies and spiders dropping dead within ten feet of the animal.Still, it’s what Jesus would have wanted, I suppose.I hope you had a great day and are taking it easy right now. And to those of you working, respect.I quite like working over Christmas Day and Boxing Day. It makes me feel virtuous, which is a rare occurrence.Anyway, there is good reason for cheer this Yuletide. The thick-as-mince rapper Stormzy may have said: “F*** Boris.”But, rather wonderfully, the British people turned out in huge numbers to say, “F*** Stormzy” and: “F*** Magic Grandpa.”It now looks like Brexit will get done and we have a government which MUST respect the wishes of all those new working-class people who voted for it.Boris is doing very well so far. It was a decent Queen’s Speech. And I like the idea his adviser Dominic Cummings has of building new nuclear power plants in the North of England.Lots of well-paid jobs and clean energy.

Reduce immigration. I mean really reduce it. To something like nine people per year. I get to choose who the nine are. Most of them will be from Hong Kong. Don’t underestimate the strength of feeling against unlimited immigration, BoJo. Andyou reduce immigration you won’t need to pave over half of our remaining countryside to build new houses. Our urgent need for housing is a consequence of a population expanding because of immigration. Stop sending children to the controversial Tavistock Clinic in London for gender realignment treatment. If people wish to transition, let them wait until they are  . In fact, let’s get rid of all the identity politics stuff. It’s isive and fatuous. We’re all in this together and it doesn’t matterwe’re gay or straight, white or black, Muslim or Christian, Jew or Hindu. Treat everybody equally. And end the hierarchy of whingeing victimhoods. Ban all factory farming. Immediately. Outlaw cats. Scrap the high-speed HS line and spend the money on faster links between the North West of England and the North East. Or spend it all on a TeessideService to replace the crap antiquated trains we have now. Remember how Teesside voted in the election, Boris  Close the polytechnics in which kids who are not very academic pay more than £, to get a worthless degree in gender studies or something. Reduce the number of people going to university by  per cent. Introduce apprenticeships and technical colleges. And scrap tuition fees. Insist that university staff must represent a ersity of opinion. All universities which “no ” speakers to be punished financially. End the BBC licence fee. Insist that cyclists always use cycle lanes where they have been provided. Reduce the number of buses in London by  per cent in off-peak times. Make it illegal for lorries to overtake on two-lane dual carriageways and motorways. Make smoking legal in pubs that I go to. And other pubs,you like. Recognise Jerusalem as being the capital of Israel and move our embassy there. Outlaw the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement for its horrible anti-Semitism. Stop meddling in Middle Eastern politics. Stop invading Muslim countries, or bombing them. Accept that they may not want to live in democracies, or believe what the rest of us believe. Keep a bit of a closer eye on the Chinese state. Increase our military strength to three per cent of GDP. Force Heinz to reintroduce Toast Toppers and Cadbury to reintroduce the Aztec bar. Divert more money from the Premier League to grass-roots football development and also to clubs below the top ision. Especially Millwall, natch. Drop the notion that people who allege that they have been raped MUST be believed. Allow the police to use common sense and discretion. Scrap all elected Police Commissioners and end the politicisation of our police force. Encourage the Old Bill to investigate crimes that genuinely hurt people — like burglaries, assaults and robberies — rather than supposed “hate crimes”. End the badger cull. Now. Make it legal to scratch or deface cars which have a “baby on board” sign in their windows. Recognise that while our country must afford tolerance to all believers in all religions, the United Kingdom is by tradition a Christian country and that Christian values should be especially respected. Arrest elderly people who take too long at cashpoints. Maybe take their cards off them.  Make the former Speaker John Bercow do I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! along with some real low-rent nano-slebs, such as that Lauren Goodger woman and maybe Joey Essex. End all ersity training, everywhere. Ban restaurants from serving sourdough bread, or at least insist they provide an alternative to people who can’t stand the stuff. Invest a few quid in the north of England. Transfer some of the wealth from London to the magnicent towns and cities which once led our industrial revolution. Especially Middlesbrough.

How low-carbon can you go  Reduce meat and dairy consumption, as beef and sheep livestock have a high carbon footprint. If you’re not ready to go completely without, try Meat Free Mondays Grow your own: You don’t need a big garden. Salad leaves, chilli and herbs are just a few of the things that grow well in containers. It’s a low-cost way of reducing your reliance on super-market fruit and vegetables. Switch off when idle: Leaving TVs, games consoles, the washing machine and microwave on standby eats energy. Some appliances draw energy even when they are not being used and phone chargers are among the worst culprits. “Vampire power” costs each house up to £ a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Use energy-saving lightbulbs: LED bulbs can last up to , hours, while some newer models are good for double that. As they use far less energy, you will quickly see impressive savings on your energy bill each month. Which  magazine puts the annual cost of running an LED lightbulb at £., compared to £. for a CFLtype and £. for halogen. Over the course of an LED bulb’s very long letime, it can save you around £. Be a careful cook: Only use as much water as you need and cover your pans so you save energy. Overfilling your kettle is a waste of electricity so only boil as much as you need. Lose the plastic packaging: This wrapping is energy-intensive in its production and causes serious damage to habitats. Choose items that are light on packaging, and refill as much as possible. There is no reason to buy tomatoes on a plastic tray which is also wrapped in plastic. A loose tomato tastes just as good. Find out more about the supermarkets’ war against plastic. Go low: Set the washing machine at C or even C. Doing the laundry at C instead of C can be one third cheaper on energy. For lightly soiled clothes, try C. And make sure that your machine is full. Get free water-saving devices: Moving water around the country and treating it requires huge amounts of energy, so get in touch with your water company to find out what gadgets you can get for free, such as low-flow shower heads which use less water. Make your home cosy: Draught-proof your doors and windows, install secondary-film glazing, top up your loft insulation to cm and get your boiler serviced. Accord-ing to the Energy Saving Trust, loft insulation for a semi-detached house will cost around £, with £ savings a year, while insulating a mid-terrace house will cost around £ and save £ a year. Turn down radiators in rooms you are not using: You don’t need to heat a room you’re not in, so use radiator controls to adjust temperature. Slow down on fast fashion: We buy more and more clothes each year. So choose vintage items, rent something for those special occasions and don’t forget charity shops. Oxfam has a great online shop. For outfit rentals, try websites like byrotation, hirestreetuk and mywardrobehq. If you do really want to buy new clothes, look out for certications of sustain-ability. Use the Good On You app to find out which shops are reducing their impact on the environment. Watch super-market air miles: Potatoes do not rack up air miles like imported rice. Likewise, dairy has a high carbon footprint, so swap a latte for a regular coffee. Look for the Red Tractor symbol on food supplied by British farmers. Buy strawberries, for example, from Norfolk, not Morocco.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The incident was captured by Sheffield Hunt Saboteurs, a group who protest organised fox hunts and ensure dogs are not being used to kill foxes - in line with the Hunting Act . In this yearaposs Boxing Day action, the group drove across North Yorkshire, stopping at the Badsworthaposs meet. While still in their vans, one of the activistaposs captured the hunt supporter running towards the vehicle carrying a dead fox. He then begins using the fox as a weapon, battering the vanaposs windows with the animalaposs leless body while covering his face to protect his identity. The man, with a prominent tattoo on his right hand, repeatedly hammers the car to the horror of those inside. A man in the vehicle can be heard saying: f**k, theyaposve got  dead fox, theyaposve got dead fox. Another woman screams stop it before they car drives away. Pictures of the van after the attack show the windows covered in the blood and innards of the fox. The protesting group took to social media to share footage of the scum who launched the attack. They said: We decided to spread festive cheer across North Yorkshire.  First, we stopped off at the Badsworthaposs meet at Kirk Smeaton. Though they are now merged with the YAS and Bramham Moor, they still have separate Boxing Day meets. The Badsworth went for a bit of a trot. The local scum were clearly unhappy not to see some actual hunting, so decide to be aggressive and block vehicles in and smash our window with a roadkill fox whilst also smashing bits off our vehicle.

The Duke of York attempted to set the record straight about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and counter allegations he slept with one of his groomed teenagers. But Andrew was widely condemned for his unsympathetic tone and lack of remorse about the friendship when grilled by BBC presenter Emily. He was also mocked for claiming he is medically unable to sweat and that he could not have had sex with his accuser because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey.Emily said the Palace later informed the Newsnight team it thought they had done a “fair job”. Of the Prince, she said: “The impression I got was definitely that he had been happy with it.” Andrew stepped down from official public duties following the backlash. The newsreader and journalist told Radio Times magazine: “I didn’t see it coming. It wasn’t an attempt to bring down the royals, just a chance to ­understand the story.”  Emily admitted she “never expected to hear” some of his answers and suspected there are words “he wishes he’d chosen dferently or better”. But she added she has a respect for him facing her questions head on. “I think you have a curious duty of care towards your interviewees,” she said.

And while she generally remains publicly on neutral ground in terms of politics, some experts believe her annual address to the nation hinted at her own views on the Brexit debacle.For her speech, pre-recorded at Buckingham Palace and shown after her husband Prince Philip, , was released from hospital, Queen Elizabeth wore a royal blue cashmere dress and a sapphire and diamond brooch. Academics have interpreted this as her way of showing support for remaining in the European Union, due to the outfitaposs similarity to the EU flag. The brooch, originally a present from Prince Albert to Queen Victoria on the eve of their  wedding, has a deep blue stone surrounded by  diamonds, mirroring the flagaposs circle of stars.Taking to Twitter, academic Dr James Anderson said: The Queen has full editorial control of the Queen’s Speech and can choose wether or not to give one. She chose not to in .So treat the speech as her personal views, right down to her choice of an EU blue dress and an EU stars broach. While Dr Geoff Jones used a picture of the monarch during the speech and wrote: Her Majesty yet again doing what little she can to show her support for the European Union.Another twitter user pointed out she wore the same brooch when she addressed the European Parliament in . But other twitter users arenapost so sure. Jan Davies wrote: More likely the blue was chosen to stand out against the background that Sapphire brooch was a gt from Albert to Victoria.Taken as a whole with the photos of her father, husband  next  heirs, I think sheaposs emphasising family  continuity. During her speech, the Queen reflected on the th anniversary of the D-Day landings, an event which helped to turn the tide of the Second World War in the Alliesapos favour. Victory, of course, paved the way for a united Europe.  Prince Albert himself was born near Coburg in Germany, with the royals, since the turn of the last century, descending directly from our European neighbours. They were even forced to change their name to Windsor from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha during the First World War. The Queenaposs heritage is very much rooted in mainland Europe, perhaps going some way to explaining her apparent support for remaining in the EU. The Prince Albert brooch itself also symbolises true love, having been a present shared between a couple soon-to-be married, which could have been selected to show Elizabethaposs support for her own husband during his bout of ill health. During her address, she described  as quite bumpy, with the last  months including Prince Andrewaposs car crash interview about his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.There has also been Prince Harry and Megan Markleaposs struggle with public le and reports of a rt between the couple and Prince William and Kate."},{"url":null,"title":"single dad who scooped 1m","story":"NewsSingle dad who scooped £m on Lotto scratchcard still worked on Christmas DayDidzis Pirags, , a chef and kitchen manager at The Hungry Horse in Garstang Road, Broughton, refused to let down his customers who had booked a festive meal despite becoming a millionaireShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsDidzis Pirags won £ million on the National Lottery Merry Millions game \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes. Half-time came giving a much-needed break to the players and spectators.Eilidh Cameron obliged with her customary goal a minute into the second half, however, Ardnamurchan replied  minutes later.The game was in the balance but Eilidh Cameron got the decisive goal on  minutes.The play continued to flow from end to end and at full time both teams had good reason to hold their heads high after providing such entertaining shinty for the crowd.Euan McMurdo, Shinty Regional Development officer, said: #Credit has to go to the players and coaches for providing such an entertaining match at a time of year when most people want to stay warm indoors. It was great to see so many girls playing which will help bolster the ladies teams at Kimory and Ardnamurchan.#He added: #Thanks to the players, coaches and spectators for their hard work throughout the year, referee Alec MacVicar for his handling of the game and willingness to help officiate and the Mossfield ground staff for, as always, providing such a great surface to play on.#"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 4 2","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode The latest episode of the BOBcast # Join presenters George Graham, Keith McIntyre and Stephen Day in their latest audio golfing adventure.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca

themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who

The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L. Wareham, Lizzie McCallum, F. Hall, and Messrs C. Kelly, W. McClymont, McKendrick, D. Macdougall, jr., Neil McCallum, and Edward Galbraith, the latter contributing Gaelic songs with ability and success.While all did well, the audience were particularly appreciative of the efforts of Miss L. McCallum and Mr C. Kelly, who had to respond to encores which would not be denied.Mr J. Smillie gave several violin solos with marked success, the audience showing great delight in his performances.A vocal duet was given by Messrs Kelly and McCallum.Rev. Norman Mackenzie, M.A., minister of the congregation, presided over the gathering with great acceptance.Miss Agnes Macmillan, organist, played the accompaniments with taste and sympathy, and has much credit by the success of her direction of the entertainment.A few remarks in a happy vein were made by Rev.

MacEchern, of Castlehill Church, and at the close the customary votes of thanks were appropriately moved by Mr Robert Colville."},{"url":null,"title":"too much turkey go for a slog in the sand","story":"Campbeltown Running Club is once again hosting its Boxing Day Slog in the Sand.There is a K and a fun K, which even walkers and their dogs can join in with, and best of all, it is all in aid of a very good cause.So get along to Westport Beach on December  in plenty of time for the registration which opens at .am, ready for the am start.It costs £ to join in the fun and all the proceeds are going to the Sunshine Room at Campbeltown Hospital.If you want to know more, email enquiries @campbeltownrunningclub"},{"url":null,"title":"letter funding boost for coastline communities","story":"I heard from many constituents while checking up on local road and pavements conditions.The potholes brought to my attention have all been reported to our roads department with pictures included.There has been some good news for infrastructure across Argyll and Bute with the recent announcement there will be a funding boost for local coastline projects.Local coastline initiatives will share £. million funding allocated to Argyll and Bute from the Scottish Government’s Crown Estates Fund.This includes coastal roads improvements, flood mitigation and emergency works of £,.With Argyll and Bute having more than , miles of coastline, this funding award is much needed and long overdue.There are so many shovel-ready projects that need doing across the Kintyre and Islands ward so hopefully we can look forward to some rapid responses to at least some of our many pressing infrastructure challenges.Councillor Alastair Redman,"},{"url":null,"title":"liam seals place in scotland world cup squad","story":"This time Liam Naylor is set to go one better, by starring at the tournament itself.The -year old, who grew up in Liverpool but whose mother Marie Nayloris from Campbeltown, made the squad after impressing in the team’s final qualying round in the Netherlands in the summer.In the six-team tournament, the seam bowler’s half-century with the bat against Jersey, and stellar performances against Ireland, France, Denmark and the host Dutch side, were enough to book his place in the Scotland squad for the showpiece tournament, being held in South Africa across January and February.Reacting to his selection, Liam said: ‘I’m really excited about the news. The weekend of the selection I was down in London with some friends, so when I got the call to say I had been picked it was a mixture of happiness and relief.‘On reflection, I thought I’d done well in the qualiers and I didn’t see any reason why I shouldn’t be selected.’And while feeling a little out of the loop with Scotland’s weekly training sessions since the qualying tournament, Liam has stayed World Cup-ready through his training and playing schedule at the prestigious Wellington School in Taunton, Somerset, where he also studies.He explained: ‘I can’t make training in Scotland as I’m down in Somerset, but I keep in touch with some of the players and coaches. There are new players training all the time and I was hoping my performances in the qualiers were going to be enough, so it felt great be selected.’After spending Christmas in Kintyre with his family, Liam can look forward to warmer climes next month, when he and the rest of the squad fine-tune their preparations at a training camp in Dubai, before flying on to South Africa, where Scotland will open their tournament against the cricketing might of Pakistan on January , before facing Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.The top two teams advance to the quarter finals, while the bottom two take part in an eight-team Plate section.Liam, who is the grandson of Douglas McKerral, of Meadows Avenue, said: ‘It’ll be crazy going from Christmastime in the west of Scotland to the Middle East for training in the space of five days, but it’s all really exciting.‘At the tournament itself, we’ll play Pakistan first, who have one player taking wickets in top-level test cricket against the likes of Australia and Sri Lanka, while Bangladesh are the top under-s side in the world. Zimbabwe are well known in cricket too.’The opposition will be tough but Liam is looking forward to the tournament, on both competitive and emotional levels.He added: ‘This is my biggest challenge yet – I’ll be playing against people I’ve seen on TV, the kind of thing you want to do growing up.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"family-bonnie-babies-champion-2019-celebrate-victory","story":"This yearrsquos winner is Rhea McKinlay, who was born on April  in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application. I am disappointed by the decision but it went through the democratic process."},{"url":null,"title":"mekala-osbornes-family-put-christmas-hold-recovers","story":"The -year-old, from Wallyford, a former Preston Lodge High School pupil, fell ill while travelling through Vietnam with what was originally diagnosed as bronchial pneumonia.After being put into an induced coma in a critical condition, Mekala was moved to a hospital in Singapore before she eventually travelled to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.Mekalarsquos mum Yvonne Bonnar McAulay said Mekala was now able to sit up in a chair for several hours a day and was being weaned off a ventilator however she said it feels like a bit of a ldquostandstill time in her recovery.She told the Courier: ldquoDue to everything thatrsquos happened, we feel itrsquos appropriate to put Christmas on hold.ldquoWe will have a wee breakfast for [her brother] Danny: he doesnrsquot understand Christmas so itrsquos pretty much another day for him, but we are doing our best to give Danny his own wee special Christmas Day.ldquoGranny is helping out so I can spend the afternoon and some of the night with Mekala.ldquoIt is a long road ahead as she needs to get her lungs working properly and then concentrate on gaining her muscle back throughout her body, then physio will start.ldquoShe will be in isolation until after the year.

This feeling is not only of academic interest making for a cheerier Christmas - it really matters.Companies can now start to plan, to dust off investment plans, to create wealth and jobs. Of course there will be dficulties as the UK leaves the EU but the fever has broken and people can move forward.:Mark Smith: Happy Christmas First Minister ndash here are some questions I think you should answerNot all parts of the UK voted for a Conservative Government. North Ireland has its own very dferent politics. Among other places London voted Labour as did Wales. Scotland also voted dferently, with about a third of the electorate voting for the SNP. Wales and London seem to accept that although they didnrsquot vote for the Government we have now got, the UK as a whole did.Scotlandrsquos problem, and it is a problem, is that we have relapsed into an SNP led victim mode. The cringeworthy wailing that we are being ignored, that this is all an outrage, that somehow the panto Tory villains have done us in - itrsquos just embarrassing.In contrast to those in England , who are more positive, business people in Scotland are much less so. They cannot take the view that political uncertainty is behind us and start planning for growth. They dread the SNPrsquos disruptive agenda.They know the SNPrsquos currency plans are undeliverable and carry many dangers, they know that England is four times as important a market for Scotland as the rest of the EU world isand that disrupting frictionless access to that market would be catastrophic for Scotlandrsquos prosperity. They fear that given free rein the SNPrsquos interventionist instincts and spending plans coupled with Scotlandrsquos large budget deficit would mean interference in their business and crushing taxation on their company and their family.So what is a rational business person in Scotland forced to consider now instead of focusing solely on growing their business   The answer is that they start to think of moving activity and themselves out of Scotland.I am not suggesting that business investment will cease or that all those who run and own businesses will leave in January. That wonrsquot happen but what those who support independence fail to realise is that there are few really large businesses which are only active in Scotland, they have activities well beyond it and the choice of where investment goes is affected by political uncertainty. There are also few owners of large businesses in Scotland who are here all the time - they travel extensively, they might have a home in London or abroad as well as in Scotland, almost certainly some of their family will live outside Scotland. For these people it is quite easy to slightly sht where they spend their weekends, where their business is run from or where they build a new factory to a place outside Scotland.:Nicola Sturgeon demands permanent referendum power for HolyroodThe SNP has no mandate for a second referendum and the uncertainty caused by constantly calling for one will result in Scotland being less prosperous.

Like its parent ldquopolitically correct, woke is a passion of the urban left. It is PC for the age of LGBTQIA+. suggested ldquowoke as word of the year, which arguably it should be, though not for the reason it thinks. For woke has changed meaning in the last  months, and become a term of derision, referring to a style of self-righteous, right-on thinking favoured by, well,columnists. It is now used to denote the metropolitan identity politics that contributed to Labourrsquos greatest defeat since the s.:Guy Stenhouse: Time to Get Over itNo-one is sure where the word ldquowoke came from, except that it emerged from African-American vernacular for ldquostaying alert, as in ldquostay woke, brother. In recent years it was adopted by the BlackLivesMatter movement with their hashtag #staywoke ndash meaning keeping black issues uppermost on social media.It was soon adopted by white millennials to emblemise not just racial awareness but a whole identitarian outlook on le. Woke expresses the ultra-feminist, multi-ethnic, gender non-conforming culture fashionable in American and UK campuses.Woke people love people of colour and loathe ldquostraight white males, ldquogammon and ldquoboomers. They adore so-called ldquonon-binary people who claim not to identy with any gender. No-one is quite sure what non-binary means. Do they swing both ways  No, thatrsquos bisexual. Are they transgender  Definitely not, and nor are they intersex. Itrsquos one of lersquos mysteries to many folk who are less woke.Wokeness has recently taken the media and advertising world by storm. Companies eager to keep up with the zeitgeist waste no chance to wave the rainbow flag and include multi-ethnic themes. This is sometimes called ldquowoke-washing. Every TV advert from McDonaldrsquos to John Lewis now has to feature a multi-racial family, asthe advertisers believe having two white people on one sofa is racism.The BBC drama Years And Years was kind of Woke Family Robinson. Black professhysional mother, transshygender daughter, gay cousin, asylum-seeker boyfriend, disabled sister ... all fighting the good fight against the emerging fascism of Brexit Britain. This compendium of woke identitarianism came complete with a middle-aged white dad. He naturally emerged as a morally worthless, adulterous creep, fit only to be punished by losing all his money.: Mark Smith: Happy Christmas First Minister ndash here are some questions I think you should answerWoke is easy to satirise and has been, mercilessly, by the comedian Andrew Doyle with his social media creation, Titania McGrath. She is a -year-old middle-class gender studies graduate, obsessed by her imagined victimhood, who identies as an ecosexual, non-binary person of colour and fights for social justice by writing bad poetry. ldquoThe only thing thatrsquos white about me, says Titania, ldquois my skin.She firmly believes women can have penises and that people should have electronic chips inserted in their brains to report heterosexual thinking. Men who have sexual dreams are guilty of rape, according to Titania.Woke folk thought Titania was the product of the homophobic, alt-right, fascist MSMndash or did until her creator, a gay Labour voter, was exposed last year. She is one of the great satirical creations of the century, just donrsquot expect Doyle to get invited on to The Mash Report.Woke is no joke. The leftrsquos penchant for strict identity politics, and the exotic fringes of LGBTQIA+ has had political consequences. The social media assault on ldquowhite working-class Brexit voters as racists and bigots was a factor in the alienation of traditional Labour constituencies. People in Bolsover, Workington and Sedgefield donrsquot much like being portrayed as fascists. Who knew There is a sanctimoniousness and intolerance about woke culture that is itself sometimes redolent of the authoritarian right, especially its approach to language. Anyone who mistakenly says ldquocoloured people instead of ldquopeople of colour, for example, will be ostracised. Pronouns must be obeyed. Feminist academics are no-edthey question whether transwomen are biologically female.Barack Obama warned the Democratic Party to avoid this ldquowoke politics with its ldquocancel culture. This is the practice of social justice warriors on Twitter demonising anyone who fails to conform to their particular form of non-conformism. If Trump wins again, it will in part because the Democrats havenrsquot listened.There is an anti-science, quasi-religious aspect to woke. Woke biology insists that sex is not innate but is ldquoattributed at birth ndash asevery child is born transgender. During the General Election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tried, with disastrous results, to defend the woke dogma that biological sex doesnrsquot exist.Woke wars are raging in the Scottish National Party and have been since Nicola Sturgeon declared her support for self-ID ndash a law change to allow transgender people to self-identy as women without the need for medical intervention or convincing evidence that they have lived as women.There has been a vigorous reaction against this from feminists in and out of the SNP. They fear womenrsquos refuges, changing rooms and prisons are liable to be invaded by men declaring themselves to be female. They also resent being called ldquocis by wokeasians, aswomen are merely a subset of their own sex.The General Election has not caused any obvious soul-searching among the woke cadres. Indeed, the verdict ofwriter Paul Mason was a pitch-perfect expression of the woke worldview. The election was, he declared, ldquoa victory of the old over the young racists over people of colour selfishness over the planet.Such is the firm belief of the morally superior who spend their lives in an echo chamber saving the world from imagined hate crimes.

Instead the earliest it could happen would be one to two years after the  Holyrood elections.On the mandate issue, while Nicola Sturgeon claims it is ldquounarguable, she is well aware of many potential arguments against it, not least because the latest General Election was primarily about Brexit. Equally, for many in Scotland the expectation that the result of the  referendum should stand for a reasonable period,not a generation, should not be overturned by a change in circumstancesopinion polling suggests those changes have not signicantly shted support for independence.As for whether leaving the UK would be more complex and painful than leaving the EU, no one observing the machinations of the last three years of negotiations can think it would be anything but far worse to disentangle from the much closer and deeply seated UK union.Finally, the First Minister will not want to publicly contemplate what she would dothe majority for independence in any future referendum was only slight. Would less than one per cent still be enough  Would a statistical draw be taken as justying separation  Mr Sturgeonrsquos sense of fairness would have her answer no to that, but the ingrained nationalist ambition for independence at any cost will see her avoid facing up to such a conundrum until it actually happens.Keith Howell, West Linton.THE four questions to Nicola Sturgeon in Mark Smithrsquos column go a long way to identying what doesnrsquot work with her approach to major constitutional issues in. As long as elections and referendums are based on first-past-the-post , the results will be what he describes rather too gently as ldquoan inaccurate reflection of opinion.The fundamental deficiency is that FPTP does not result in a spread of opinion in the so-called representatives which reflects the true wishes of the electorate as a whole. The votes of the PR-elected Scottish Parliament MSPs may seem more representative than FPTP, but bear in mind that  per cent of them are elected by FPTP in any case and the voters have no way of influencing the opinions or actions of the remaining list MSPs.It doesnrsquot need to be this way. There is already a clear majority in the Scottish Parliament for the Single Transferable Vote and one has to question why it has not already been enacted. Mr Smith might consider adding that to his questions. I hope he gets some answers, as I havenrsquot.Thomas GF Gray, Lenzie.STUART Waitonis right to highlight how elitism can be a downfall of a political party.

Could. Not. Compute.After the slew of early morning shoppers, it would be relatively calm as there wasnt an awful lot to come into the city for.New Years Day, too, would be eerie on the way into work as every other shop front was shuttered. By lunchtime we would be jam packed with stragglers who had come into the city centre for a look around only to find the place a ghost town. Mostly it was tourists, holiday makers who didnt realise the entire country was also on holiday.Now, in the city centre, youre spoiled for choice on New Years Day. No need to stay home when you can head into town.My memory might be playing tricks, but around that time, Im sure, Next was a one-off for its early opening hour, which was why the sale created such a legion of annual fans. Not so now.This year Matalan advertised am opening hours for some of its stores. Yesterday at the Intu Victoria Centre in Nottingham, shoppers queued from am, their Christmas dinners still halfway along their alimentary canals. Thats barely enough time to have digested the clfhanger from the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special before heading to the shops.Marks and Spencer got in ahead of the crowd by starting its online sale at pm on Christmas Day.And this is where the annual handwringing about gross consumerism begins but now we have an added tension - the environmental impact.Of course weve long known that consumerism has a negative environmental impact but this year it cant be ignored, Greta Thunberg has made sure of that.As Australian bushfires rage out of control, as children strike for climate action and as Donald Trump ties himself in knots over what wind is or isnt, we simply cant justy the unfettered desire for stuff that washes over us come Christmas time.Yet, as the planet is dying, so too is the high street.This year Scotland has seen some of the worst sales figures on record with store after store folding and hundreds of jobs being made redundant. Sales yesterday were expected to fall by . per cent on last year in real le shops, although online sales were expected to rise by  per cent.Boxing Day, for many retailers, remains the busiest in the calendar year and, against such bleak trading conditions, who can grudge them it Not everyone making the journey to the high street will be buying an entirely unnecessary set of hair straighteners to replace the nigh-on identical set of hair straighteners they bought last year. Not everyone will be buying their seventh pair of boyfriend jeans, each pair imperceptibly dferent from the last.Some people will be buying important household items that theyve waited all year to pick up, say. Or treating themselves to an item they otherwise couldnt afford. Something they might not \"need\" but that makes them feel better.Its not fair or reasonable to tar all frantic shoppers with one brush.As long as people are making justiable choices - without kidding themselves over what they want and what they need - then fine.For once we could perhaps look to Trump as a positive example. I mean, sort of. Grudgingly and at a push. Asked on Christmas Eve what hed bought for his we, the US President said he had only bought her a Christmas card. Im sure it was the most beautul and bigliest card ever but still, when you have everything you could possibly need, a card is enough.Hopefully Melania saw it the same way and wasnt expecting diamonds on Christmas morning. Still, Im quite sure shes used to being disappointed by her husband.Friends, this year for the first time, stepped back from gt buying. One of my friends doesnt want presents now she has children one feels we are too old for Christmas gts another feels the time of year is too stressful and so wanted to cut out the added pressure of buying presents.I love giving and receiving gts with friends because I feel its a way of showing thought and care. Yet I cant quibble with any of my now non-gting buying friends because, ultimately, I have everything I need and I fret over my environmental impact.Among the annual conversation about how much is too much, we often forget the other people at the heart of our consumer decisions - the retail staff who are giving up festive time with loved ones to facilitate our shopping habits.Of course, theres a flip side there too. Some will appreciate being able to earn double time, particularly at the most wonderfully expensive time of year. Others wont celebrate Christmas others might be lonely at the holiday season and enjoy being at work.Yet, do we really need to have retail staff on hand to serve us at am  We dont, of course not. Christmas is as much a time to relax, pause, take stock. We have whittled this down to one shop-free day, meaning retail workers have to sacrice this precious lull to folk can benefit from  per cent off a bath bomb.We must cut down on our spending habits.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Isobel Thompson from Westray has been invited to take part in the naming ceremony for Odin of Scapa and offered the opportunity of a family trip aboard the new tug.Graham Sinclair, chair of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “As names that strongly reflect Orkney’s Norse heritage, these are an excellent choice for the new tugs.“Tugs operated by first class crews play a vital role at the heart of our harbour operations and have helped support the welcome growth in maritime activity we’ve seen in local waters in recent years“I am pleased we are investing in even more capable vessels, which will ensure the continuation of  years of support for the Flotta Terminal and, more recently, the signicant growth in ship to ship work # and allow us to make the most of current and future marine business opportunities, greatly benefiting the economy of the islands.”The design and build contract for the -metre tugs was secured by Sanmar Shipyards of Turkey after a competitive tendering exercise.Construction is taking place at Sanmar’s new specialist tug building facility at Altinova, about an hour south of Istanbul, where work on both tugs is progressing well # as can be seen from the latest photographs taken during a recent inspection by Orkney Marine Services towage staff.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the end of January, the UK will be out. While a transition period will immediately follow, exit day will see British nationals lose their EU citizenship, UK MEPs withdrawn and British flags in Brussels taken down.Scotland has a distinct story on Brexit. Besides reaffirming EU membership in the  referendum, it decisively rejected Brexit at every subsequent democratic event. In landslide fashion,  per cent of Scotland’s new Westminster MPs support staying in the EU.Heading into the post-Brexit future, a healthy dose of realism will be required on how the EU will approach Scotland. Since the Brexit vote, the Scottish Government’s strategy towards the EU  has been one of dferentiation. It has underlined how Scotland supports EU membership and the free movement of people, in contrast to the UK overall. Those points have generated favourable sentiment for Scotland in Brussels and EU capital, but good feelings only go so far.: Path open for independent Scotland to ‘walk into’ EU membership: Why an independent Scotland in EU might not be paradise – Bill JamiesonThe reality of Brexit is that Scotland will become a peripheral actor in Brussels. When the UK moves from member state to ‘third country’, Scotland’s access and relevance will signicantly reduce. While the Scottish Government and wider society can sustain EU relationships through the links they have already forged, the challenges will nevertheless be substantial.EU will remain silentWhatever influence Scotland is able to maintain in the EU will come from two sources. One is practical cooperation on areas of mutual European interest, like renewable energy, climate change and articial intelligence. The other is Scottish participation in the big debates on the future of Europe and our collective place in the world. Success will necessitate a widening of horizons.On Scotland’s independence debate, the EU will remain largely silent after Brexit. Occasional favourable pronouncements from particular MEPs and national parliamentarians on an independent Scotland joining the EU will undoubtedly continue. But the European Commission and the EU member states – the principal decides – will have little to say.Even once the UK has left, EU decision-makers will continue to see the question of Scottish independence as an internal British matter, from which they will want to remain distant.Despite the outward disinterest, private EU opinions on an independent Scotland have notably shted since the Brexit referendum. For many in Brussels, the logic of pro-European Scotland joining the EU after the departure of Brexit Britain is compelling. It would serve as a powerful antidote to the narrative of failure and loss associated with the UK’s abandoning of the EU. But those views will remain utterly unspoken while the independence debate rages.Clear candidate for membershipIn a future independence referendum, EU officials will certainly not repeat their ill-judged and inaccurate statements on the apparent dficulties of Scottish EU membership. Such interventions around the  referendum were misguided attempts to be supportive of the UK Government, and not reflective of the reality, then or now.Whether or not a new referendum lies in Scotland’s near future, over-optimism on the EU should be checked at the door. Scotland as part of the UK will shortly become an external partner of the EU, with all the associated challenges for engaging and influencing. Were it to become independent, Scotland would be a clear candidate for EU membership, but accession would take around four to five years after formal independence.Scotland must avoid the kind of exceptionalist illusions which fostered the UK’s disconnect from the EU and led to Brexit. Its pro-EU sentiment is a valuable resource which should be channelled into practical form. After Brexit, Scotland will have to approach its EU relations with pragmatic strategy.Anthony Salamone is managing director of political consultancy European Merchants©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

The am service is regarded as an official engagement with attendance approved by the Queen and attracts hundreds of spectators.However, he did attend the am private service earlier in the morning with the Queen and other members of the Royal Family, and was seen walking alongside Price Charles.Following the interview with Maitlis, the duke has withdrawn or been dropped as patron from more than  charities, including English National Ballet and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, following the negative publicity after the interview.He was also ditched as chancellor of the University of Huddersfield after students said he was unfit for the role due to his “association with a known paedophile”.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

An exit poll at pm yesterday predicting a possible SNP gain from the Liberal Democrats ultimately proved to be wrong, with a comfortable majority of , for Mr Carmichael in the end.It was Mr Carmichael#s sixth win in the Northern Isles. He has been the MP for the seat since .The Lib Dem used his acceptance speech first to thank the ing officers, the other candidates for a #spirited and good-natured campaign#, his own campaign team, and we and family, who had been #staunch in their support#.He went on to say that representing the people of Orkney and Shetland had been, and remained, his #greatest privilege#.It was more of a #mixed picture#, as Mr Carmichael said prior to his election result announcement, for the Lib Dems across the board.The party were unable to capitalise on their strong anti-Brexit message in this election, making a net loss of one seat across the UK. They now have  MPs.This included a shock scalp in the form of party leader Jo Swinson, who lost her Dunbartonshire seat earlier in the night to the SNP.Despite being pipped to the post in this constituency, it was the SNP who made big gains across Scotland, taking  more seats. The party#s performance prompted their candidate Mr Leslie to say that a second Scottish independence referendum is something that #seriously# needs looking at.However, that may prove dficult given an incoming government who have said they will refuse to grant one.Boris Johnson has the keys to Number  after securing a majority government for the Conservatives. Targeting leave-voting Labour areas seems to have paid off for the Prime Minister.Labour lost  seats on the night, prompting leader Jeremy Corbyn to announce that he intends to stand down.Their candidate Coilla Drake called it a #sad, sad day#.Mr Carmichael also used his acceptance speech to criticise Mr Johnson and his incoming government.#The next five years is going to be a dficult and dangerous for this, our United Kingdom,# he said.The newly re-elected MP, however, ended on an almost hopeful note, focusing on the need for #liberal voices#, unity and solidarity, which he said was #greater than ever before#.The turnout for the Orkney and Shetland election was just under  per cent, with , Northern Isles folk voting. raquoSo , how did the Remain parties# anti-Brexit policies work out for them  Ten years of Tory government, as a direct result.

As a Swede I feel a strong fellowship. Hope the outcomewon#t tarnish it.No Brian, the SNP only say they want to Remain, as a stick to beat Westminster with.Their defining policy, independence, was guaranteed to take us out of the EU # with #No Deal# # on independence Day. The EU has confirmed this #repeatedly#.They also know they would be unable to rejoin until we satisfy the EU#s onerous conditions, notably:. Austerity to cut necessary borrowing within EU Stability and Growth Pact guidelines. .Establish our own central bank and currency # this will take nine years .. Hand the EU control of our economy and trade, agriculture and fisheries.Throw in control ofenergy and our military and Scots will never vote for it. They know that, too. So expect a policy switch, replacing EU membership with EFTA. . It follows that they are only demanding Indyref  because they #ken fine weel# it won#t be allowed and will use that to stoke phoney grievance against Westminster, with the added advantageof it being over before we find out what kind of trade deals Westminster achieves with the EU, US, etc.Goodness, so the SNP did so well because they are aLeave Party!No, Brian. The SNP did not do well #because they are a secret Leave party# . They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland. Labour has gone from being the predominant Scottish party for decades to fourth position, behind the LibDems, with a single MP who stated in his election speech that #Labour must change or die.#Labour#s demise was well under way, long before Brexit arrived on the scene.So why did ex-Labour voters in Scotland vote for a secret Leave Party while ex-Labour voters in England voted for an up-front Leave Party!My grievance with Westminster is not #phoney#.Why don#t you tell us, Brian After all, you are one of the ones who deserted Labour, jumping ship to the SNP.The reasons for Labour#s demise in Scotland were not much to do with Brexit. It was well under way, long before Brexit. So back to my original point. What did the SNP and the Scottish people get out of the Remain parties# anti-Brexit policies  #Ten years of Tory government, as a direct result.# Maybe the SNP are pleased about that, it does help their independence campaign Whit are you spaekin aboot, John  I voted Labour.Who no mak a new year#s resolution: stop readin da Mail!.."},{"url":null,"title":"challenging year with amazing achievements amenity trust report states ","story":"It has been a busy period for the organisation which has also had a number of well-publicised financial challenges in recent years and is now under new leadership with a focus on effective governance.The review provides a summary of some of the key activities the trust has undertaken over the past financial year.Highlights include the Hans Holbein exhibition which saw the trust exhibit one of the most important artworks ever to come to Shetland.Shetland Amenity Trust chairwoman Ruth Mackenzie.As a lead partner the trust also hosted the Follow The Vikings Roadshow which toured Europe with a professional cast engaging world-wide audiences in our Viking heritage.A range of environmental improvement, natural and cultural heritage projects and services were also delivered for the benefit of Shetland.The trust’s work ranges from Da Voar Redd-up to tree planting, from the Sumburgh Head lighthouse to the museum and archives, and from Shetland Wool Week to the regional archaeology service.The trust’s accounts for   were fully audited and demonstrated that the organisation had managed to reduce its debt by over  per cent from the previous financial year.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"ninian scoops window prize for second year running ","story":"There were winners galore in Lerwick town centre on Monday as the top Christmas window was announced and the Elf trail came to an end.Ninian staff receive the trophy for the best Christmas window.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna.

I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane.

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit sees record 900000 applying for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There were a number of success stories around Strangford Lough with terns, grey seals, Brent geese and otters all showing an increase.A protected species, the number of grey seal pups recorded annually has risen dramatically, from around six or seven greys in the early s to more than  in .\"Weve been actively monitoring the seal population on the lough now since  and grey seal numbers are up considerably in the last number of years,\" said Hugh Thurgate, lead ranger at Strangford Lough. \"The peak count for adult grey seals visiting the lough during the breeding season this year was . This boom reflects the burgeoning UK population which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea. \"Theres also been an increase in the number of breeding areas available to the seals as more of the islands on the lough become uninhabited. \"The seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young, somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance and Strangford Lough offers them that.\"Unfortunately, the harvest or common seal is not enjoying the same kind of success on the Lough. Numbers of pups have flatlined to between - each year with the total population now alarmingly low at under one hundred.\"Light-bellied Brent geese arrived back at Strangford Lough this autumn after a very successful breeding season in the east Canadian high Arctic.Strangford Lough supports over % of the total population in the early autumn. Of the , counted on the official census date on October , .% were recorded as juveniles.But  was catastrophic for the loughs terns. Heavy storms resulted in the swamping of the islands, causing a nest washout. A growing otter population with an appetite for tern eggs and chicks also contributed to a huge fall in healthy chick numbers.The Trusts  survey has shown much more promising results, with the number of young fledglings per pair up across all breeds.In , there were  young Sandwich tern fledglings, rising to  in  common tern saw just  fledglings hatch in , rising to  in . In , there were only three Arctic tern fledglings, but  this year.\"Much higher chick numbers are a direct result of a breeding season that was free from freakish storms and floods,\" said Hugh.Closely linked to the Lough is the Ards Peninsula where the Trust has been working in partnership with the Ards Red Squirrel Group to restore the native red squirrel population.Toby Edwards is the ranger leading the project.\"At Mount Stewart we have around - reds and across the whole Peninsula we estimate there are  reds now, which is close to the natural capacity for the area. This is great news and it shows what can be achieved when organisations work together to develop a plan for the protection of a species.\"Warm spells of weather in the early half of the year saw migrant species of butterflies, moths and dragonflies from the south and east arrive in the UK. Signicant numbers of Painted Lady butterflies arrived en masse for the first time in a decade. In total, Painted Ladies made up more than half of all the butterflies and moths counted in Northern Ireland this year.But  new species of moth were recorded here, many of which are migrant species.Ben McCarthy, National Trust head of nature conservation and restoration ecology, said sightings of migrant insects and birds are becoming more common across the UK.\"This is a result of our changing climate. Although this can seem exciting, the obvious flip side is how these changes will start to affect some of our native species already under pressure from intensive land use, habitat fragmentation and climate change,\" he said.\"Butour wildle doesnt have anywhere to move to as temperatures rise and the weather changes over the coming years we will inevitably see more and more species at risk of becoming extinct.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/62958/38812320.ece/BINARY/cdb003.jpg","title":"welcome to the world northern irelands 2019","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_feb-ea-f-d-aabb_EmailChimpanzees have a sense of rhythm and like to move to the beat, according to a new study..pushScientists have found that listening to music prompts the primates to perform rhythmic movements such as swaying, hand-clapping and foot-tapping.The researchers say that understanding more about the predisposition of these great apes to music could shed light on how humans came to appreciate melodies.Dr Yuko Hattori and professor Masaki Tomonaga, of Kyoto University in Japan, studied seven chimpanzees who were exposed to six two-minute piano compositions for six days.They found that while the music was being played, the chimps swayed their bodies and bobbed their heads and, sometimes, went as far as clapping their hands and tapping their feet.The team also found that male chimpanzees were more likely to respond to the tunes by being more vocal and swaying rhythmically for longer durations compared with their female counterparts.In their paper, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers noted: “Given that humans do not have such a sex dference in musical ability, higher sensitivity to sound in male chimpanzees may have been acquired after chimpanzees erged from the common ancestor shared with humans.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A male chimpanzee making a rhythmic display at the enclosure in the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University “This may also be associated with their patriarchal society, where male chimpanzees often collaborate to protect their territory and group members.”To understand more about their musical inclination, the researchers selected the chimpanzee most responsive to the music.They then exposed the animal, called Akira, to additional musical sessions, with four two-minute experiences for  days.The researchers found that both random and regular beats induced rhythmic swaying in Akira.The movements were more pronounced when Akira was standing on two feet rather than on all fours, which the researchers believe could be down to the chimpanzee having a greater flexibility in the bipedal posture.In addition, Akira also stayed longer in the area where music was playing, indicating that the chimpanzee actively sought musical stimulation.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The chimpanzee enclosure at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University According to the authors, the findings point to a foundation for dancing in a common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.The team wrote in the paper: “In humans, listening to music induces rhythmic movement, suggesting a close connection between the auditory and motor areas in the brain.“These results suggest that prerequisites for music and dance are deeply rooted and existed in the common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees, approximately six million years ago.”Meanwhile, in a separate study also published in Pnas, scientists have found that chimpanzees share tools with each other and teach their fellow beings new skills so they are able to perform complex and challenging food-hunting tasks.Researchers in the US say that this act of sharing tools and skills in chimpanzees is similar to that seen in humans."},{"url":null,"title":"monkeys enjoy specially baked mince pies ahead of christmas at london zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in . Among others who have recorded it are Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Chieftains, Daniel ODonnell, The Seekers, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Petula Clark, Jethro Tull, Sineacutead OConnor and Sufjan Stevens, St. Pauls Choir School and most recently by the Irish group Celtic Woman in their album Voices of Angels.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

The new league structure saw them test themselves against a handful of intermediate sides which set them up for a tilt at a championship. In truth they never looked tested until Drums comeback in the final but Glacks greater fitness levels saw them push on. Drum had a dficult season but after coming close to folding, they dusted themselves down for a rattle at the championship.They found the going tough against Sean Dolans and almost came a cropper against Doire Colmcille but they deserve a lot of credit for getting themselves back to the force they once were. googletag.cmd.push  - JM McLaughlinThe OConnors didnt concede a championship goal until the final. A huge part of that was the stability they gained from James Martin McLaughlins presence behind his defence. He gave them confidence, kicked with conviction, his handling was impeccable and he could do little to stop Rory OReillys goal in the decider.[st All-Star]  - Seamus OKaneOKane was more than the average corner-back. He was tigerish in the tackle and in the final, despite giving away height to Aaron Moore, he limited the Glack mans influence. On top of that, he scored - in four games, including four points - including two in the closing minutes - to save them from a shock defeat against Doire Colmcille.[st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Ryan OKaneWas very much the fixer in Glacks defence. The number on his jersey was irrelevant. He was tasked with blotting out danger. In the semi-final, he won two vital possessions intended for their danger-man Patrick Feeney.In the final, he picked up Niall Ferris and kept him quiet until the Drum man went on a roving role to save the game.[st All-Star]  - Jimmy OConnorJimmy picked up his first award in  and continues to deliver.Glacks play anywhere player was key to all that they were about. A superb block to deny Gary Fisher in their win over Dolans demonstrated his defence nuance but his first-half display in the final was out of the top drawer. His engine allowed him to get forward to kick two points and he played a central part in Cormac Boyles point. [th All-Star]  - Niall FerrisAfter picking up a hurling award, he is selected for the fourth time in the football number five jersey. He missed the opening game with Dolans but landed three points in their great escape against Doire Colmcille. His use of the ball in the middle third was a hallmark of Drums semi-final win over Magilligan. Wasnt effective in the final until he pulled deep to help his sides comeback.[th All-Star]  - Niall BurkeA first selection since  for the Drum defender.In the semi-final win over Magilligan, he had the courage to spray passes from defence in dficult conditions. When Drum were struggling for scores early in the final, he passed to Kevin OReilly for a point. In the second-half his work-rate dragged Drum back into contention.[rd All-Star]  - Ryan MorganIts Morgies fourth selection but a first in a defensive slot.Glacks new management team deployed him at wing back and it gave them an extra attacking dimension.Missed the early rounds of the championship but he was the key to unlocking Moneymore early on. In the final, he scored twice but was the springboard for Glacks counter-attack, linking well with Jimmy OConnor.[th All-Star]  - Martin McGonigleAfter being selected as a minor in  All-Star line-up, he is now the heartbeat of Glacks midfield.The former county minor players endless running saw him destroy both Doire Colmcille in the first round and Moneymore in the semi-final.Enjoyed a tough battle with Shane Millar in the final but still got forward to play a part in two Glack scores. ~[nd All-Star]  - Eddie McLaughlinThe long-serving midfielder just edges out his colleague Ciaran Carmichael for the spot.Listed at midfield but his defensive instincts saw him drt between centre-back and the important holding role, with McGonigle bombing forward.It was his defence-splitting pass that set-up Niall McGowans killer goal to put Glack  points clear in the final. [nd All-Star]  -Cormac BoyleIn a new role this season, Boyle played much of the season as a ball-winner at wing-forward, where he worked unselfishly for the team.He chipped in with -, including a point to cap a man of the match performance in the final, when he dominated kick-outs.His absence was felt when injury ruled him out of the Rock game.[nd All-Star]  - Niall McGowan -JUNIOR PLAYER OF THE YEARMcGoo scored - across Glacks club championship games, led by example and was the fulcrum of their devastating attacking game.He played between full-forward and as a link man as the OConnors eased their way to the a first title since .In the final he finished his goal with precision and kicked a wonder point from a sideline to cap it all off.[rd All-Star]  - Collie MullanHe started the championship at corner-back against Moneymore and one of his passes from defence put Magilligan through for their opening point.It was when Leo Sweeney moved him into attack that he began to blossom. After scoring - against Ardmore, he gave Drum plenty to think about in the semi-final and had what looked to be a late point ruled out with the game in the melting pot.[st All-Star]  - Odhraacuten McKaneOne of the most exciting players in this years campaign was the Dolans inside forward.He tortured Drum in the first-half, scoring every time he got on the ball. The following week, he scored - against eventual winners Glack.His athleticism and accuracy made him a match for anyone.[st All-Star]  - Kevin OReillyA second award after being named at full-back in the  selection.He landed - as Drum progressed to the final and his long ball almost opened the door for a James McCartney goal against Magilligan in the semi-final. But it was his awareness and use of the ball that made him invaluable. His six points against Doire Colmcille were invaluable and in the final he pulled deep late on, trying to engineer a comeback.[nd All-Star]  - Patrick FeeneyIn what was a testing season for Moneymore, Feeney was the ray of light in their attack.With blistering pace and ied runs, he totted up a score of -as Moneymore qualied for the semi-finals.He found the going tougher as Glack shut out the supply but he still managed to get on the score-sheet[nd All-Star]    If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The feast of St Stephen, the first Christian martyr, is marked on  December and in Ireland is often referred to as Laacute Fheacuteile Stiofaacutein or Laacute an Dreoiliacuten or Wren Day. Traditionally, this is also a popular day for visiting family members and going to the theatre to see a pantomimeThe name alludes to several legends including ones found in Irish mythology that link the le of Jesus to the wren bird. In a fading tradition in all but a few parts of Ireland, people dress up in old clothes and straw garments and travel from door to door carrying fake wrens during which those taking part sing, dance and play music.Dependent on which region of Ireland you are in those taking part are called either “wrenboys” or mummers. Mummers carry on the tradition at the village of New Inn, Co Galway and Dingle, Co Kerry. In the North, the tradition is still often observed in Co Fermanagh. The tradition has its roots in ancient Ireland when a real wren was killed and carried around in a holly bush tied to a long pole - these days fake birds are used. The wren is one of the smallest birds in Ireland, but it has a very loud song and is sometimes called the “king of all birds.” This is because of the legend of a little wren who rode on the top of an eagles head and boasted he had “flown higher than an eagle.” Wrens were hunted for many years throughout Europe in medieval times with Ireland no exception to that. In most parts of the island, the tradition died out in the early th century and the rhyme often used during the procession was “The wren, the wren, the king of all birds. On St. Stephens Day was caught in the furze. Although he was little his honor was great. Jump up me, lads, and give us a treat.”In past times, the captured wren was tied to the wrenboy leaders staff or a net would be put on a pitchfork. It would be sometimes cruelly kept alive, as the popular mummers parade song states A penny or tuppence would do it no harm.” The song, of which there are many iations, asked for donations from the townspeople. One iation sung in Edmondstown, County Dublin ran as such: If you havent a penny a halfpenny will do. If you havent a halfpenny, God bless you!”Often the boys gave a feather from the bird to patrons for good luck. The money was used to host a dance or Wren Ball for the town on a night in January. googletag.cmd.push  St Stephen, the first Christian martyr was stoned to death in Jerusalem in Ad . Wrenboys would go from house to house in the countryside collecting money but in the towns the groups were more organised and there was often an element of faction-fighting. In both cases there would be a Wren Captain, usually wearing a cape and carrying a sword, musicians, strawboys and others dressed as old women or other things. It is a day of wild revelry and people usually conceal their identities so they can play tricks on their friends. This type of behaviour is typical of Celtic festivals as a sort of purge. The band of young boys has expanded to include girls, and adults often join in. The money collected from the townspeople is now usually donated to a school or charity.The wren celebration may have descended from Celtic mythology. Ultimately, the origin may be a Samhain or midwinter sacrice or celebration, as Celtic mythology considered the wren a symbol of the past year. The European wren is known for its habit of singing even in mid-winter, and its name in the Netherlands, winter king, reflects this. Celtic names of the wren- draouennig, drean, dreathan also suggest an association with druidic rituals.In the Welsh version of the myth, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, a Celtic hero, wins his name by hitting or killing a wren. He strikes a wren between the tendon and the bone of its leg, causing Arianrhod, his mother, to say it is with a skillful hand that the fair-haired one has hit it. At that Gwydion, his foster father, reveals himself, saying Lleu Llaw Gyffes the fair-haired one with the skillful hand is his name now.And, in the Isle of Man, the hunting of the wren is associated with an ancient enchantress or queen of the fairiesnamed Tehi Tegi which translates to something like beautul gatherer in Brythonic. The Manx spoke Brythonic before they switched to Gaelic. Tehi Tegi was so beautul that all the men of the Island followed her around in hope of marrying her, and neglected their homes and fields. Tehi Tegi led her suitors to the river and then drowned them. She was confronted, but turned into a wren and escaped. She was banished from the Island but s once a year, when she is hunted.The myth most commonly told in Ireland to explain the festival is that God wished to know who was the king of all birds so he set a challenge. The bird who flew highest and furthest would win. The birds all began together but they dropped out one by one until none were left but the great eagle. The eagle eventually grew tired and began to drop lower in the sky. At this point, the treacherous wren emerged from beneath the eagles wing to soar higher and further than all the others.The tradition may also have been influenced by Scandinavian settlers during the Viking invasions of the th to th centuries though it is usually attributed to the Christianising of old pagan festivals by saints to ease the transition and promote conversion. googletag.cmd.push  A depiction of the wrenboys taking part in the St Stephen’s Day procession. Various associated legends exist, such as a wren being responsible for betraying Irish soldiers who fought the Viking invaders by beating its wings on their shields.In , Liam Clancy recorded The Wran Song , which was sung in Ireland by wrenboys. In  Steeleye Span recorded The King on Please to See the King, which also reflects the tradition. They made another version, The Cutty Wren, on their album Time. Hunting the Wren is on John Kirkpatricks album Wassail! The Chieftains made a collection of wrenboy tunes on The Bells of Dublin. In the song, The Boys of Barr na Sraacuteide, which is based on a poem by Sigerson Clford, the wren hunt is also prominent.

This time of year is always one for reflection, and as I look back on  I do so with a sense of pride at serving as your Mayor for the last six months, particularly as the first person from Strabane town to do so. I have experienced so much in my political career, but this has been – and continues to be – one of the most rewarding and enjoyable roles that I have ever held. From when I first took on the Mayoral chain in May, I have had the pleasure of taking part in engagements across our entire District, and even further afield. In those many engagements I have met new faces aplenty from our community groups, schools, charities and all the local organisations who make a positive contribution to our society. So many times I have sat back in awe of the talented, kind, inspiring people that we have here, and that have allowed Derry and Strabane to keep growing as somewhere we are proud to call home. These are people who do so without want for praise, who work tirelessly and quietly behind the scenes, and I want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to them. We have continued to embrace ersity, and all cultures, ages, religions and orientations have been celebrated this year. A particular highlight for me has been engaging with both the younger and older members of our District. I have visited several of our primary and secondary schools and seen for myself the many wonderful young people with whom our future is in very safe hands, while my regular Mayor’s Tea Dances have been thoroughly enjoyable. I’ve heard so many stories, had so many laughs, and enjoyed a few spins and twirls on the dancefloor along the way!Another element of great pride for me has been the money raised for my two chosen Mayor’s charities – Foyle Women’s Aid and the Koram Centre, Strabane. They are two charities close to my heart and representing issues – women’s rights and mental health – that I feel are very prevalent in our society. I have always tried, and will continue to try, to raise awareness of the wonderful work that they both do, and it brings me real joy to know that it has made a positive impact for them. Once againm  has been an award-winning year for the District, with Brooke Park given the prestigious ‘Green Flag’ status for the third year running, while, for the first time, we were victorious in winning the Small City category at the Britain in Bloom awards. Congratulations to everyone who helped us achieve those successes, they were certainly well-deserved. On a regeneration front we have continued to move in a positive direction. In June, we received the fantastic news of €. million of EU PEACE IV funding for the ‘Riverine’ project, which will create an exciting cross-border community space across Strabane and Lford. We have made further investment in our local play parks, including Newtonstewart, while launching our ‘Out to Play’ Play Plan Public Consultation. Furthermore, the opening of the Clooney Greenway and the re-opening of St Columb’s Park Avenue has highlighted our commitment to investment in the regeneration of our beautul District, while work begun on the St Columb’s Park Walled Garden project. We have also been working hard on a corporate front and in that regard it has been a real trademark year. Recently we have published our first Statement of Progress in line with our Strategic Growth Plan. This has been a huge step in our Community Planning process, and one that will help the District develop on a social, economic and environmental front. We also published our draft Local Development Plan which will guide development decisions within our District in a transparent and open way. Linked in with that is our pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan which aims to maximise the number of s that our local parks and green spaces can provide.As well as that, we launched our Council Arts and Culture Strategy which, also in line with the Strategic Growth Plan, is designed to complement Councils Tourism Strategy and Integrated Economic Development Strategy.As a Ballycolman native, I have, of course, been delighted with the ongoing progress of our Strabane Business Improvement District plan. The continued efforts of the BID team has encouraged people to shop locally, while the introduction of additional CCTV cameras in the town, and the granting of planning permission for the Strabane Public Realm project has further encouraged positive development.We also emphasised the importance of giving our young people a voice when I hosted our Local Democracy Week in the Guildhall in October for primary schools and secondary schools , while our recent careers fairs in Derry and Strabane gave them a chance to learn more about their future.Meanwhile, in November I travelled as part of our north-west trade delegation, alongside Donegal County Council, to Boston and Philadelphia. It was a trip of real signicance in ensuring that we continue to strengthen our business links and personal relationships with those across the Atlantic, while I was also delighted to meet with some of our diaspora. As Mayor I am in a unique position where I have a  to bring attention to ious issues, and I have been happy to do so in supporting organ donation week, gas safety week and blind cord safety awareness. In September, I was honoured to speak at the th International Association of Suicide Prevention conference, held in our city. I have also been passionate in my support for the battle against domestic violence. As I mentioned regarding my Mayor’s charities, these are two issues that are, unfortunately, extremely relevant in our current society and ones that I will continue to support wholeheartedly. While there have been so many things to celebrate this year, I’d also like to take a moment and reflect on those we have lost. The death of Ivan Cooper in June was something deeply felt not just across Derry, but on a national scale. Ivan’s role in the history of the city is one that cannot be underestimated, and we continue to remember the actions that he, and others, took which paved the way for all of us to enjoy a more prosperous future. We also lost Pat Gillespie in August, at the age of . Aptly nicknamed ‘The King of Strabane’, Pat – who was renowned for his collection of bikes and cars - brought a smile to many faces in his long and happy time on this earth, and he leaves behind a legacy that will be felt in the town for many more years to come thanks to the kind donation from his family of some items from his archive. I’d like to take this opportunity to once again offer my condolences to Ivan and Pat’s family and friends, and to all who have lost loved ones in the last year. Our District is one that has always been welcoming to all, and we had a host of events that showed the very best of what we have to offer for both our local community and our hundreds of thousands of visitors. Once again, the Street Food Festival, Strabane Summer Jamm, Waterside Half Marathon, Sperrins and Killeter Walking Festival, Slow Food Festival, Culture Night and Fashion Fest all proved huge successes. We had a fantastic year celebrating our young people with the Rewire Festival for Youth, while in July Derry played host to the National Cycling Championships – an iconic moment in our sporting history. We had the chance to mark our illustrious heritage with the Walls  programme, and ersity was at the fore as I attended and led the Foyle Pride parade in August. Indeed, I have been delighted to immerse myself in all cultures in , and in September it was my pleasure to host a Chinese cultural celebration in the Guildhall. As always, our Halloween festival proved to be bigger and better than ever before – with Derry making headlines around the world. And so, we all turn our attentions to a new year. Now at the halfway point of my tenure as Mayor, I can only hope that the next six months will be as wonderful and rewarding as the last. In our current climate, the role of local councils has become more important than ever before, and I am honoured to stand at the helm of that. But, the bottom line is that it isn’t about me or my fellow councillors, it is about you – the people of Derry and Strabane. You are what makes this District what it is, and it is a privilege to work for and alongside you to make sure we are the best that we can be. I would like to wish all of you a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the months ahead. Already there is so much to look forward to in , and I, for one, cannot wait. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

And we visited all the local shops and businesses on Central Drive with gts to say thank you for everything they have done for us. Its great for the childrens confidence to go out into the community and we always get people phoning us to praise their great behaviour.The school also raised pound, for St Vincent de Paul through the school raffle, which will help local families in need.-- googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks.Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the “New World” and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.”This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.”The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. It is a matter of historical record that Englands King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after the Second World War that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day.An English farmer, Thomas Tusser. noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey, appeared as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That, of course, came in  when Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew.According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year – nine million of those for the Christmas season alone. However, that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the US, three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day.In Norway, for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway, they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany, the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile, in Jamaica Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At a traditional Argentinean Christmas dinner you’ll most probably find turroacuten at dessert. Turroacuten, also known as nougat, is typically made of sugar, honey and egg white, with toasted almonds or other nuts. It comes in dferent shapes, such as a rectangular tablet or a round cake. googletag.cmd.push   - Australia  It might be hot in Australia at Christmas time, but Australians still have a White Christmas. This is the name of their traditional Christmas dessert. It’s basically a mixture of raisins, cherries, dried coconut, icing sugar, milk powder and rice bubbles, with hydrogenated coconut oil as the ingredient that puts all the rest together. White Christmas is usually served cut into squares and because it’s very easy to make even children give it a try in the holiday season.  - Belgium  Belgians bake cougnou or bread of Jesus during Christmas time. This sweet bread is formed like a baby Jesus and is decorated with dferent elements such as flowers, circles etc. The composition includes flour, eggs, milk, yeast, raisins, sugar and is usually enjoyed with a cup of hot chocolate. googletag.cmd.push  - Brazil  One of the most popular Brazilian desserts is pudim de leite condensado or condensed milk pudding, containing condensed milk , regular milk, eggs and caramelized sugar on top. Whether it’s Christmas or other festive occasions, Brazilians take every opportunity to serve this custard dessert.  - Canada  The Yule log, a dessert shaped to resemble a miniature log or a chopped off tree branch, is a form of sweet roulade made of sponge cake. It is traditionally prepared for Christmas in other countries as well for example, in France it’s known as bucircche de Noeumll. The original Yule log recipe dates back in the th century and has developed many iations along the way. The most common combination is basic yellow sponge cake and chocolate butter cream.   - France  In France, it is customary to serve  desserts at the Christmas table. Les treize desserts de Noeumllrepresent Jesus Christ and the  apostles and they include walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, apples, pears, green melon, black and white raisins, figs oranges and mandarins. The desserts are traditionally set out on Christmas Eve and remain on the table three days, until December .  - Iceland  Iceland’s Laufabrauethconsists of a round, very thin flat cake with a diameter of about  to  cm , decorated with leaf-like, geometric patterns and fried briefly in hot fat or oil. Baking this leaf bread is an important part of the Christmas preparations in every home in Iceland.  - India  A popular Christmas cake served by the Christian population of Hindustan in India is the allahabadi, a rum fruit cake originating and lending its name from the Northern Indian city of Allahabad. It’s made with maida flour, eggs, claried butter, sugar, petha - a translucent soft candy from North India, marmalade, nuts, ginger and fennel as its main ingredients.  - Italy  The cupola-shaped sweet bread called panettone is originally from Milan and it became an omnipresent dessert on Italians’ Christmas Eve dinner. The process of properly preparing the panettone in order to obtain its distinctive fluffy characteristics takes several days. It contains candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as dried raisins. It is served in slices, vertically cut, accompanied with sweet hot beverages or a sweet wine. In some regions of Italy, it is served with crema di mascarpone or crema di zabaione.  - Japan  Even though Christmas is not a national holiday in Japan - with only about  percent of Japan’s population being Christian - the Japanese do have a Christmas cake. The dessert is a type of sponge cake, covered with snow-white whipped cream and topped with red strawberries. The red and white in this cake reminds of the Japanese flag colors and this is probably why the cake became so popular in Japan that it even has its own emoji. The Japanese Christmas cake is a perfect example of Western traditions being adopted by the Japanese culture and given a dferent and fresh meaning.  - Mexico  Hot beverages are almost as popular as baked desserts at Christmas time. In Mexico, the drink that accompanies the festive meal is atole, which includes masa , water, piloncillo , cinnamon, vanilla and optional chocolate or fruit. Atole ies in texture, ranging from a porridge to a very thin liquid consistency. Instead of masa as a main ingredient, rice, flour, or oatmeal can be used.  - Norway  The most commonly eaten Christmas cookie in all of Norway is pepperkake - translated as pepper cake. It’s a ginger bread cookie spiced with black pepper and formed into a heart or other shape. Pepperkake is complemented with coffee, tea or especially gloslashgg, a spiced drink served warm, with or without alcohol.

Cllr Cusack said it was “reassuring” to have had the officers react so quickly to her request to try tackle the problem by installing surveillance cameras at the “hot spot.” She added: “I know that there’s hardly a street which is not affected by fouling throughout city and district and sympathise with residents and those affected. “However, given there are only a few of these cameras and a lot of resources needed to monitor them, it’s a case of having to prioritise areas.“Hopefully, the public will understand that a school deserves the attention and other areas can be looked at going forward.“There are also limitations with regards to where and how surveil- lance can be conducted. While this may help deter irresponsible owners allowing their dogs to stray and foul, realistically it will not eradicate the problem, it is a mindset which has to change and that is not easy. “I would keep calling on the public to report and assist Environmental Health with any information they may have.”Concluding Councillor Cusack said: “Meanwhile, I will be addressing the prospect of Council investing in more such cameras and resources to combat the problem.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening. Bredaghrsquos John Devaney becomes the st holder of the countyrsquos main position, having been selected unopposed to succeed Mayobridge man Sean Rooney.In his first address to delegates, Mr Devaney outlined a strategic vision for the association in the county and a number of areas of focus for his term of office.The key priorities will be the proposed Centre of Excellence, the development of a new coaching plan, recruitment of referees, and a programme to encourage and nurture new and young administrators.Following his election, Devaney said: ldquoThe Ballykinlar Centre of Excellence is clearly the single biggest project that we will have undertaken, and will take time and resource to bring to fruition. ldquoWe have set out our intention and we are determined that it will happen, because it is a fantastic opportunity for the county. But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since . He is a former chairman of the Queenrsquos University GAA club and the Higher Education GAA Council, and has served on Ulster Council Management Committee and Central Council.Further details on the proposed new Centre of Excellence at Ballykinlar were outlined at Wednesdayrsquos meeting.Planning permission for the development was submitted earlier last week and the early concept designs of the complex were presented to club delegates. The site at the Ministry of Defence base will encompass four pitches, a MUGA and an administration and exhibition museum centre. Down GAA will now plan to appoint a Project Board in the New Year.Maureen OrsquoHigginswas elected as the new vice-chairperson of the board, on an evening when a number of officerships changed hands.Outgoing chairman Sean Rooney was selected to represent the county on the Ulster Council alongside Sean McCashin. Donal McNallywill assume the position of Irish and Cultural Officer, while Drumgathrsquos Michael McArdle is the new delegate to Central Council.As a result of disciplined financial management in recent years, the presentation of the financial report by treasurer Diarmuid Cahill showed a strong position for the county moving forward.Fourteen motions on the convention agenda were all approved, including ten proposals to go forward to the GAA Congress in Dublin at the end of February. These include: points deduction as a penalty option for a breach of the rule on lsquomisconduct considered to have discredited the association removing the rule which allows a newly-transferred player to finish playing in a competition he had started with his former club a  month hiatus on a further transfer for a player after his transfer has been granted adult inter-club championship games to be extended to  minutes per half.Convention also approved a proposal for the GAA to engage with RTEacute on extending their TV competition provisions to allow entry from viewers in Northern Ireland.Officers elected at the  annual convention: chairman, John Devaneyvice-chairperson, Maureen OrsquoHigginssecretary: Seaacuten Oacuteg McAteer treasurer, Diarmuid Cahillassistant secretary, Michael OrsquoRourkeassistant treasurer, Brendan FitzpatrickPRO, Fiona MurphyDevelopment Officer, Willie GribbenIrish and Culture Officer, Donal McNallyCentral Council delegate, Michael McArdleUlster Council delegates, Sean Rooneyand Sean McCashin ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick couple enjoy 65 years of marital bliss  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK couple whose introduction was gently engineered by the husband-to-bersquos mother will celebrate  years of marriage on Saturday.Muriel and Alan Major will be surrounded by family and friends when they mark their blue sapphire anniversary.Muriel and Alan, who are both  and from Saul Road, admit they found a ldquogem in each other.They credit their long and happy marriage to a shared love of musicand the arts and never allowing a disagreement to remain too long without making up.The couple say that they have been blessed with three sons, Glenn, Richard and Ian, two grandchildren, Hannah and Thomas, and two great-children, Louis and Lila.They were married at the age of  in Ballyphilip Parish Church, Portaferry, by the Rev Lindsay on December ,. Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me.

If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case.

In the report the architects catalogued a series of setbacks over the past two years and blamed most of the delay on strikes and shortages of materials.Downpatrick councillor, Mr Sean Quinn, launched into a scathing attack on the architects, who, he said, had failed to serve the council as they as they should.Mr Quinn said he found it disturbing that the architects must have known of the troubles on the site, yet had still made ldquowild predictions about the proposed opening date.Mr Quinn also condemned the mounting costs of work on the scheme and then drew attention to the pool itself, saying he felt the interior design was lacking in imagination.Mr Cecil Maxwell reminded councillors that they had approved the pool design and he did not think the architects were at fault for the slow progress.DROMARA mdash ADromara schoolgirl flies out to London tomorrow to represent Northern Ireland in a major essay competition.

He said that in the light of the ldquoBrexit catastrophe, people stood up and put the interests of people in the constituency to the fore.Conceding that he expected his vote to decease, the ing MP said that he was delighted to top the poll, highlighting the need to get Stormont up and running again.ldquoIt is important that we have locally devolved institutions.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

If and when an Assembly election happens, we will certainly be putting a lot of effort into securing a seat in South Down.Mr Brown said he went into the election with the intention of building on the partyrsquos best ever performance in a Westminster poll two years ago when it secured , votes.ldquoWe wanted this election to be our best ever result and we have done that, he declared.ldquoI would say that we knocked more doors in  than in this election as I was responsible for the partyrsquos social media and digital marketing campaign. As a result, my time was split between South Down and helping out in other areas including North Down and East Belfast.ldquoI know that working full time on an election campaign in South Down we can achieve an even better result. I also know that a lot of our voters did vote tactically and respect their decision to do so. Some of my friends voted SDLP this time which wonrsquot happen in an Assembly election.Mr Brown said many would have suggested that Alliance hit its electoral ceiling in  and firmly believes there is much more to come from his party locally.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a - success on Saturday over PSNI at Shamrock Park.A Lee Bonis brace alongside goals from Chris Lavery, Adam Salley and Callum Ferris secured victory.“We were - up at half-time but had kept moving the ball around and the final goal was the most pleasing in terms of representing so much of what we work towards,” said Tipton. “It came after a -pass team move - by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Return to top flight remains the target for Portadown says Matthew TiptonSuspected illegal drugs found at gates of NI nursery schoolNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsTraffic and TravelTraffic update -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
