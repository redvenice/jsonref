How lovely. F*** business. Slash welfare. Take a holiday\u0027.The former New Labour heavyweight also told LBC this morning: \u0027Everybody\u0027s entitled to a break and you want people in public life to be fit and healthy and focused and my problem with him is that it underlines the fact that he isn\u0027t really focused on the job in the way that he should be.\u0027I think you\u0027d be hard-pressed to say the country is in a very good state at the moment. Energy crisis, HGV shortage, real shortage, real problems in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol.\u0027There\u0027s half a dozen things that the Prime Minister should be gripping.\u0027It\u0027s also true, as you know I worked with Tony Blair a long time, you can do an awful lot of work wherever you are, but I feel that Boris Johnson is trolling us the whole time.\u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027s focused on the job in the way that he should be.\u0027It was reported yesterday that Mr Johnson was \u0027utterly exhausted\u0027 by the events of recent months. The Prime Minister has not had good luck with his holidays, with his summer \u0027staycation\u0027 in the West Country curtailed by the Afghanistan crisis after barely a day. He was spotted scurrying to Taunton train station in August with his shirt tail flapping out of his trousers as Kabul fell under Taliban control. That came a year after an equally disastrous break to the Scottish Highlands, where he pitched a tent on a windswept shoreline next to a holiday cottage. The trip was cut short for security reasons after his location was exposed by a national newspaper. Mr Johnson also came close to \u0027catastrophe\u0027 when he was swept out to sea while attempting to paddle-board during the trip, only to be rescued by his security detail, it was claimed. MailOnline approached Downing Street but a spokesperson declined to comment. Six major crises going on in the UK as Boris Johnson jets off on holiday - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Its not job tell Government things want hear Sir Patrick Vallance","story":"Share this article The full interview will air on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm on Tuesday October 12 as part of the station\u0027s \u0027Day of the Scientist\u0027.Asked whether he was happy with Boris Johnson\u0027s description that No10\u0027s decision-making was \u0027led by science\u0027 or \u0027following the science\u0027, Sir Patrick said: \u0027Well, I think I\u0027ve been clear about that. \u0027And I will be again here...

We just don\u0027t know.\u0027And decisions have to be made, so it\u0027s trying to get the boundaries of that uncertainty clear for people is important.\u0027He added: \u0027But you know the other thing that\u0027s different is that as a scientist, when you get evidence that changes your mind because it\u0027s now giving you new information, that is an exciting part of scientific progress. For a politician that feels like a U-turn. \u0027Or for the media that often feels like a U-turn.\u0027And that that\u0027s a very interesting distinction that\u0027s important to try and communicate effectively to politicians.

File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  The chief executive of Dublin City Council has been criticised for “snide and dismissive” comments to a students’ union that raised concerns over the use of purpose-built student accommodation by tourists. In a tweet on Monday, the president of the University College Dublin Students’ Union (UCDSU) Ruairí Power posted a short excerpt from a letter signed by Owen Keegan on the accommodation issue. Purpose-built accommodation for students became a controversial subject last month when it emerged planning applications had been seeking changes of use so that some such accommodation could be marketed to tourists for short-term use. The UCDSU and Mr Keegan exchanged two letters each relating to the union’s concerns in relation to the conversion of 571 private student flats in Dublin city into tourist accommodation for the coming academic year.Contacting Mr Keegan on the issue, Mr Power said the union was deeply frustrated at a decision to grant planning for this that would “undoubtedly perpetuate the supply crisis and artificially inflate rents across the city. “To prioritise the profit margins of private purpose-built student accommodation providers over the public good is a shameful act which will push young people into precarious living circumstances over the coming months.”Council policyIn a comprehensive response setting out council policy, Mr Keegan said it had granted permission for a significant number of PBSA schemes and had also received applications for temporary change of use to tourist accommodation. These latter proposals, he continued, were treated “on their merits” and permission was often granted on the basis of completion delays or “other impediments which would result in part of the complex not being ready for occupation by students at the start of the academic year”.He also noted how the Covid-19 pandemic had affected the level of demand for accommodation among the student population.“In relation to the particular ‘change of use’ application referenced in your letter the applicant indicated that the majority of the existing bed spaces would remain occupied by students, with additional vacant bed spaces providing overnight accommodation for tourist and business visitors.” Mr Keegan also noted that no objections were received to the planning application. However, dissatisfied with this response, Mr Power said that “a rudimentary level” of stakeholder engagement with third-level institutions would have identified significant student demand for the current academic year.“A vacuum of leadership from the council executive during a period of significant challenge for students impacted by the supply and affordability crises is most unfortunate,” he said. ‘Not required’In response, Mr Keegan told the students’ union that the local authority was not required to undertake extensive stakeholder engagement in respect of planning applications.“It is unfortunate that UCDSU did not participate in the planning process in respect of these particular applications. However, it is not the city council’s fault that you appear to have been unaware of how the planning system works.”Mr Keegan declined to comment on the exchange when contacted by The .However, in a post on Twitter, Labour Senator and party spokeswoman on housing Rebecca Moynihan described the part of his response posted on social media as “snide” and “dismissive”. It was “not worthy” of someone who “heads up the planning authority”, she said, adding: “Dubliners want a vibrant, erse Dublin not just a property developer version of what that should be, allowed to change the rules when it suits them re PBSA.”On Twitter, Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris rowed in behind the students, saying he fully agreed that student accommodation must be for them. “I have meet (sic) UCD SU on student accommodation. The points they make are valid. My Department met with all college management bodies last week to identify solutions \u0026amp new approaches to student accommodation,” he tweeted. Social Democrat councillors on Dublin City Council have called for a special meeting to be convened to address what the party described as Mr Keegan’s “dismissive and condescending comments”."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"An increasingly vigilant public and punishments might help save this crucial habitatStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Exclusive private-only work was the first choice of 0.2 per cent before reading, and almost 20 per cent after.A significant majority (82 per cent) said they had concerns over possible deskilling if they were confined to public hospital practice, due to an anticipated lack of theatre access.“Almost all respondents have stated they may emigrate rather than accept the current conditions, which will have catastrophic implications for training, service provision and workforce planning,” the study notes.“The aim of the Sláintecare contract is to attract and train the very best clinicians.

Of this, €1 billion is said to be available for new spending and €500 million is for tax measures.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has warned that there will not be “something for everyone in the audience”. With families under pressure with inflation and rising energy costs, senior Government figures have been flagging for weeks that the budget will be focused on tackling the cost of living. So what is known? What is in and what is out in Budget 2022?Income taxes and workIt is widely expected that tax relief will be provided in the form of indexing tax credits and bands to help offset the impact of inflation on people’s take-home pay. Fine Gael has been promising such measures for months. Most of the €500 million for tax measures in the budget is set to be gobbled up by this measure. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has also said there will be efforts to promote remote working. At present, employers can give €3.20 a day tax-free to their employees. Alternatively, workers can claim a proportion of home expenses back themselves. The proposal is to update this system with workers able to defray the cost of utilities against the tax they pay.Climate actionThe latest Ipsos MRBI poll shows higher taxes on fuel are not popular – with 82 per cent opposed. But failing a major deviation from one of the key commitments in the Programme for Government, carbon tax will rise by €7.50 per tonne as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 per cent per year. This means an estimated €1.28 extra on a 60 litre tank of petrol and €1.48 more for a full fill of diesel from midnight next Tuesday. Increases in the cost of other fuels like kerosene (900 litre tank up €19.40), natural gas (average annual usage up €16.95), coal (40kg bag up 89c) and peat briquettes (12.5kg bale up 20c) would not kick in until May. The proceeds will be spent to better insulate homes, but also to increase fuel allowances for those most at risk of fuel poverty.Social welfare and pensionsAlmost half of the €1 billion available for new spending could be taken up with welfare increases. As mentioned, the fuel allowance for vulnerable households – worth €28 per week between the end of September and April – should rise. It was increased by €3.50 in last year’s budget. With high energy costs expected this winter, don’t be surprised if the increase is greater this year. A key question is whether or not State pension payments will rise for the first time since 2019. Government backbenchers are calling for increases of €10 per week. When asked, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said: “We have said that if the cost of living has gone up, and the cost of fuel, that’s something we’re certainly taking into consideration.” Some increases are a safe bet, therefore.A full Christmas bonus for people on welfare payments was paid last year including to people in receipt of pandemic unemployment payments. The Government will want to announce this if at all possible, but arguments are still in play.ChildcareThere were no measures to help with childcare costs last year . On Friday Varadkar issued the strongest signal yet that help with the costs could be on the way as he confirmed the issue is being examined as the Budget is being finalised.Earlier this week Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman said he hopes to make changes to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) next year.The levels of subsidies for the universal and mean-tested scheme went untouched for 2021. Changes to the scheme are being examined ahead of the budget as is low pay for staff and the sustainability of the business of childcare providers. An extra two weeks of parental leave is set to be introduced from next August. That will bring the number of weeks a parent of a newborn can take off work – supported by €245 payments from the State – to seven.HousingThe Coalition launched its landmark Housing for All plan just last month. It promised the “largest ever housing budget in the history of the State” with “in excess of €20 billion” to be provided – through exchequer funding, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency – over the next five years. Expect some of that to be stumped up on Tuesday. While applications for the new affordable housing scheme are not due to be open until early next year, the existing help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers purchasing new builds will be extended beyond the end of this year.HealthVaradkar promised earlier this year that the up to €4 billion in extra health spending for tackling the Covid-19 pandemic would be maintained next year. That must have been music to the ears of Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly as he entered budget talks and it would be surprising if the €22 billion allocated last year is not matched, at the very least. With warnings that 500,000 people will be added to healthcare waiting lists before the end of the year and the Sláintecare reforms hitting troubled water the Government will not want to be seen to be taking the foot off the throttle in its support for the health system.Cigarettes and alcoholAny increase on the cost of cigarettes is likely to be minimal if it happens at all. Department of Finance officials have suggested a further hike could be counterproductive and may just encourage smokers to source cigarettes from abroad. The Government is reluctant to increase excise on drink given the pressure on pubs and restaurants during the pandemic.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"budget 2022 welfare payments including fuel allowance to increase by 5 in budget","story":"Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath at the Department of Finance on Monday.

The help-to-buy scheme will be extended in its current form beyond the end of the year.Minister for Education Norma Foley secured a commitment that the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools will be reduced by one point.CarersMinister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys will announce a significant package for carers that will see the weekly payment increase by €5 along with significant changes to the means test for the allowance. The changes will mean the first €50,000 in savings will be disregarded from the means test, up from the current level of €20,000.It is understood there will also be €3 extra for the living-alone allowance, while the hot meals programme will expand to about 100 Deis schools. There will also be a €10 increase in the income threshold for the working family payment. The welfare package will cost in the region of €600 million.There will be an extension, too, of the period during which the domiciliary care allowance can be paid for children in hospital from three months to six months. There will also be a reduction in the number of PRSI contributions young people have to make to access dental treatment, from 260 to 39 weeks.The qualified child payment will increase by €2 to €40 for under-12s, and by €3 to €48 for over-12s.The State’s support scheme for businesses, the EWSS (employment wage subsidy scheme), will be extended to next April but will begin to be tapered from December. Income tax relief will be provided in the form of indexing tax credits and bands to help offset the impact of inflation on people’s take-home pay.In justice, Ms Humphreys secured the recruitment of 800 additional gardaí next year, as well as a 20 per cent increase in the Garda mountain bike unit. Some 400 Garda civilian staff will also be recruited, bringing the total level of Garda staff to 3,800, the highest-ever number.A new community safety innovation fund will be given an initial allocation of €2 million.Covid-19 fundingThe Department of Health is set to receive less than €1 billion in direct Covid-19 funding next year, down from €2 billion in Budget 2021. A renewed focus on medical waiting lists will see a funding package of more than €200 million mobilised to tackle backlogs. Free GP care for children up to the age of seven will be a feature of Budget 2022.Minister for Culture and the Arts Catherine Martin has also secured a commitment to introduce a pilot basic income scheme for artists in January as well as a €25 million fund to help venues hold events after they reopen towards the end of the month.It is expected there will be 50 cent imposed on a packet of 20 cigarettes. Alcohol looks likely to remain untouched. Carbon tax will rise by €7.50 per tonne as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 per cent per year.The VRT exemption is to be extended for two years for electric cars.Meanwhile, all young adults between the ages of 19 and 23 are to get a 50 per cent reduction in all public transport through a “young adult card for public transport”, which will apply to intercity buses and trains, and local links including buses, the Luas and Dart.The overall spending ceilings in the summer economic statement – which pointed to a budget-day package of €4.7 billion – will be maintained. This is despite some pressure on Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath in recent days after much better than expected tax figures in the budget White Paper published on Friday night showed that the deficit for this year will be much lower than projected."},{"url":null,"title":"everything we know about budget 2022 so far","story":"Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath. The Government is preparing to unveil Budget 2022 on Tuesday. Photograph: Crispin RodwellThe Government is preparing to unveil Budget 2022 on Tuesday and, until this weekend, the room for manoeuvre appeared to be limited. Unexpectedly strong economic forecasts over the weekend have dramatically improved the outlook for public finances and could lead to late pressure on the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to go that little bit further. There are still some discussions ongoing around the fuel allowance, for example, but the feeling is that most of the headline measures have now been nailed down. Here is everything we know so far:Budget 2022Tuesday’s budget package is expected to amount to about €4.7 billion. Some €3.2 bn of this is committed to existing pay and spending increases, €1 bn will be available for new initiatives and €500 million allocated for tax measures.Welfare and pensionsWelfare payments including the fuel allowance are to increase by €5 under a deal struck by the Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys ahead of the publication of the budget tomorrow.Pensioners will receive an extra €5 a week while other welfare payments such as the jobseekers payment and maternity benefit will also increase by the same amount from January. The Christmas bonus will be paid in full while the back-to-school allowance will increase by €10.The €5 increase in the fuel allowance will take effect from budget night, however, as Ministers remain concerned about backlash over the planned increase in the carbon tax.Income taxes and work It is widely expected that one of the headline tax measures will involve the indexing of tax credits and bands to offset the impact of inflation on people’s take-home pay. Much of the €500 million for tax measures will be spent on this. There may also be good news for those who are still working from home. At present, employers can give €3.20 a day tax-free to their employees. Alternatively, workers can claim a proportion of home expenses back themselves. It is expected that this system will be updated with workers able to defray the cost of utilities against the tax they pay. If the minimum wage increases in January, an increase in the USC thresholds, to keep the tax burden of those on this wage at a similar level, is likely.Carbon taxCarbon tax will rise by €7.50 per tonne as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 per cent per year. This means an estimated €1.28 extra on a 60 litre tank of petrol and €1.48 more for a full fill of diesel from midnight tomorrow. Increases in the cost of other fuels such as kerosene (900 litre tank up €19.40), natural gas (average annual usage up €16.95), coal (40kg bag up 89c) and peat briquettes (12.5kg bale up 20c) would not kick in until May.Childcare and parentingA childcare package of about €100 million next year is expected, and this may rise to €200 million annually once ramped up. As part of this, fees will be frozen for many parents and there is likely to be expanded access to subsidies for working families and unemployed people. The Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman has already indicated that he hopes to make changes to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) next year and increasing the income limits to access the scheme is one measure under consideration. It is understood that a new direct investment in childcare services will improve staff pay in return for a commitment not to increase fees. Separately, an extra two weeks of parent’s leave is set to be introduced from next August so that parents of a newborn can take up to seven weeks off work supported by the State.EducationDetails emerged on Monday of a budget deal for 1,000 special needs assistants and more than 400 special education teachers. A significant expansion of the Deis scheme was also in prospect while an increase in the Susi student grant for the first time in 10 years has also been mooted.HealthThe Department of Health is set to receive less than €1 billion in direct Covid-19 funding next year, down from €2 billion in Budget 2021. About half of a total Covid-19 spending package of €6.8 billion will be held back as a contingency fund. The renewed focus on medical waiting lists will see a funding package of more than €200 million mobilised to tackle backlogs. Spending on a women’s health package will quadruple to €20 million, while the Department of Health will be allowed to retain some of its underspend to fund more staff increases. It has also been reported that free GP care for children up to the age of seven will be a feature of the budget. Improvements to the drug refund scheme are also on the cards as is a new €10 million package to rollout free contraception.ClimateMore than €200 million is set to be earmarked for retrofitting in excess of 20,000 homes, with half to be spent on 4,500 free home upgrades for low-income or energy-poverty households. The remainder will be given in grants. Some €360 million will go on active travel measures.Cigarettes and alcoholIt is expected that there will be 50 cent imposed on a packet of 20 cigarettes. Alcohol looks likely to remain untouched as the Government is aware of the pressure on the hospitality industry because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Aviation and tourismA €100 million recovery package for the tourism sector is planned, focused on sustainable recovery, festivals and nightlife activities. The Department of Tourism will also target UK and US visitors with flagship events such as an American football college game. A basic income guarantee scheme for artists will be piloted from January. Some €25 million will be put aside to help venues put on events after the next reopening date of October 22nd.HousingSpending on housing is set to rise to €4 billion. This will include nearly €200 million in funding for homeless services and €85 million for retrofitting. An extension to the Help to Buy scheme is expected. The scheme offers a tax rebate to first-time buyers of new homes and is due to run out at the end of the year. It appears as though the parameters of the scheme will remain the same in terms of how much a person can claim back.PolicingThe number of new gardaí to be recruited is expected to rise from 500 to a new figure of 700.Business supportsThe Government has made it clear that it intends to phase out the pandemic unemployment payment but an extension to the business support known as EWSS (employment wage subsidy scheme) will be announced. There are indications that it may be needed all the way up to next summer but Ministers may find a middle ground and announce its extension until spring. The primary qualifying criteria for the EWSS is that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70 per cent of their previous turnover level and this is unlikely to change. The question is around how the scheme is recalibrated, or whether the subsidy rates change."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"false positive lateral flow tests children double week","story":"The amount of false positive coronavirus lateral flow tests has increased in secondary school children, official data show.Anecdotal evidence of children receiving a positive lateral flow and then a negative follow-up PCR have circulated on social media and numbers from the UK Health Security Agency indicates the phenomenon is indeed on the rise.Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the newly-minted UKHSA, has said the body is aware of the trend and is “looking into the cause”.Figures from Test and Trace, which used to be controlled by the Department of Health and now falls under the remit of the UKHSA, reveal that in the week ending September 22, almost 620,000 students took lateral flow tests at home as part of routine asymptomatic screening and almost 14,000 came back positive.However, 1,112 (8 per cent) of these pupils returned a negative or void follow-up PCR, indicating the lateral test result was a false positive.One week later around 580,000 secondary school students took a lateral flow test and almost 16,000 were found to be positive.Of these tests, 87 per cent (13,863) were later confirmed via PCR, with 13 per cent — or around one in eight — coming back as negative or void.The reason for the surge in positive lateral flow test results in children remains unknown, with Dr Kit Yates, a Senior Lecturer in Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath, saying it could be down to any one of myriad factors, including faulty lateral flow tests, children manipulating the test to get out of school, or a mathematical quirk brought about by the sheer volume of tests being done.In an article for The Conversation, the member of Independent Sage explains: “Understanding whether there’s something truly wrong or whether this is just a mathematical artefact has significant ramifications – for testing, contact tracing and the monitoring of the UK’s current Covid situation.“The UK Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA) chief medical adviser, Susan Hopkins, has noted that the organisation is looking into the issue.“The UKHSA acknowledges that it doesn’t have an explanation as yet but is investigating because it has “not experienced this before to such a degree”.More from NewsIreland’s Brexit hardliners are playing with fireInside Rikers Island, where detainees have taken over notorious New York prisonBritons cut ties with formal attire as sales of loungewear soar during lockdownsHolocaust: Birth certificate of survivor born in concentration camp to be shown at Imperial War Museum‘Shambolic’ MoD spends twice as much on land as it does on nuclear deterrentNearly 6,000 new homes will be built on brownfield land by 2024, vows Michael GoveMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gp phone consultations recorded face to face appointments","story":"Telephone consultations with GPs are being incorrectly classed as “face-to-face” appointments in official statistics, NHS chiefs have admitted, following an investigation by The .In recent weeks, ministers, including the Prime Minister, have intervened to promise patients access to face-to-face appointments, amid mounting concern about the difficulties some are facing.Before the pandemic, about 80 per cent of consultations took place in a doctor’s surgery. However, the latest monthly figure is just 58 per cent, with little change since officials vowed in May to give all patients the right to a “face-to-face” appointment.Now, The  can reveal that even this figure exaggerates the number of consultations which are actually taking place in person.NHS officials said that because of the way some local systems were set up, some appointments were automatically being logged as face-to-face slots, regardless of how they were actually delivered.  Anne Bedish, a  reader, viewed her own patient record online, and was surprised to see that all the telephone appointments she had in the past year had been recorded as “face-to-face” consultations.The 68-year-old, who suffers from a number of health problems and was on the Government’s clinically vulnerable list, had 12 phone appointments in the past year, which she found had been classed as “face-to-face” visits.When she contacted Glenlyn Medical Practice, in East Molesey, Surrey, to question the miscategorisation, they confirmed that the appointments had been by telephone, but the record went unchanged.NHS Digital, which publishes national data on GP appointments every month, suggested this pattern could occur far more widely, because of the way data has been recorded.Officials said: “We do acknowledge that there may be data quality issues with the data and instances where the data may not be a true representation of what may be happening in all practices. “From March 2020, face-to-face appointment mode data may not be entirely reflective of what happens in the practices, as appointment types have been assigned to appointment modes prior to the pandemic.“Thus, even if the appointment was carried out through a different mode, the appointment registers as a face-to-face appointment on the system.”Officials said this was most likely to happen if appointments had been set up in advance as a “block booking of appointments” and was most likely to affect cases early on in the pandemic.However, neither of these were the case for Mrs Bedish, whose most recent appointments occurred less than a month ago.Dennis Reed, the director of Silver Voices, a campaign group for the over-60s, said: “This needs to be investigated. How many of the figures have been fiddled in this way? It is really worrying. “I know that practices are under a lot of pressure to increase the number of patients getting a face-to-face appointment, and it worries me that we could see more and more of this.”It came as it emerged that the proportion of GP home visits have almost halved since before the pandemic. NHS figures show that while pre-Covid roughly one per cent of all GP appointments were home visits, in July and August they amounted to 0.6 per cent.Home visits are crucial for the housebound, elderly and dying, campaigners warned, although senior medical figures have been calling for the practice to be scrapped for decades.On Monday, a grieving husband claimed that his cancer-stricken late wife would still be alive if her GP had agreed to pay a home visit.Anton, the father-of-three from Bromley, south-east London, told LBC Radio he had begged a doctor to visit his 44-year-old spouse but a nurse was sent instead, who allegedly checked only her pulse and temperature.He said that by the time his wife went to hospital, her cancer had spread to her brain.According to NHS figures for August, there were 151,627 home visits paid in England, down from 157,998 in July.Patients’ groups and campaigners have warned that many vulnerable people have been unable to access care, with coroners linking a string of deaths to remote appointments.In May, health officials promised to scrap a system of “total triage” introduced during the pandemic, and give patients the right to choose to see a doctor in person.However, last month the head of the Royal College of General Practitioners told MPs there was no point making such promises when GPs did not have the capacity to meet them.But the Prime Minister insisted patients were entitled to be able to see a doctor who could give “proper hands-on understanding” of their problems.Boris Johnson said: “I am absolutely certain that unless we can deliver that there will be people sadly whose symptoms are not picked up and who will suffer as a result.”Mrs Bedish said: “It really worries me that this data is giving a misleading picture of how many patients are actually getting a face-to-face appointment with their doctor, and allowing ministers to claim the situation is improving.“I have no problem with my GP practice. Some of my appointments, like one for a skin condition, would have been better face-to-face. But my concern really is about the national data, and how it’s claiming most appointments are happening in person when it doesn’t seem that way at all.”NHS Digital said that the data was “experimental” and only provides an indication of GP activity, as it was pulled from GP practice systems, which record data as they see fit, rather than answering specific questions such as mode of appointment.Caveats published with the monthly data state: “The mode of the appointment shows the setting of the consultation. For example, face-to-face, telephone, home visit, etc. This is set locally by the practices so may not represent the actual care setting of the appointment. For example, some video conference appointments may be logged by the practice as face-to-face.”More from NewsIreland’s Brexit hardliners are playing with fireInside Rikers Island, where detainees have taken over notorious New York prisonBritons cut ties with formal attire as sales of loungewear soar during lockdownsHolocaust: Birth certificate of survivor born in concentration camp to be shown at Imperial War Museum‘Shambolic’ MoD spends twice as much on land as it does on nuclear deterrentNearly 6,000 new homes will be built on brownfield land by 2024, vows Michael GoveMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sally rooney refuses allow new novel published hebrew due views","story":"Sally Rooney, the acclaimed Irish author, has reportedly refused to allow her new novel to be published in Hebrew due to her views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The disclosure was made in a recent newspaper interview which said that Rooney had turned down a translation bid from Modan, an Israeli publisher, as she supports a boycott of Israel.Rooney\u0027s new novel, Beautiful World, Where Are You, was released in September and quickly topped book charts in the UK and Ireland.When Modan approached Rooney\u0027s agent in an attempt to sign another translation deal, the agent announced that Rooney supports the cultural boycott movement on Israel and therefore does not approve translation into Hebrew, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.The interview with Rooney was published by the New York Times in September, but was then translated into Hebrew and published by Haaretz with additional details.Haaretz added that Rooney\u0027s agent, Tracy Bohan, confirmed that the author had declined the translation when approached for comment.The  approached both Rooney\u0027s agent and Modan, the Israeli publisher, on Monday night but did not immediately receive a response.Rooney\u0027s two previous novels, Conversations With Friends and Normal People, have both been published in Hebrew by Modan.Rooney, 30, has previously been outspoken about her opposition to Israel\u0027s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, which the Palestinians claim as their own land.She recently signed an open letter which called for an end to the support provided by global powers to Israel and its military especially the United States”, and also urged governments to “cut trade, economic and cultural relations”.In a report on Monday night, the Jewish ic Agency also noted that in her second novel, Normal People, the main characters attend a protest against Israel\u0027s role in the 2014 Gaza war.The boycott revelation - which was not mentioned in the original New York Times article - was brought to light in a blog post by Gitit Levy-Paz on the website Forward.Rooney’s decision surprised and saddened me. I am a Jewish and Israeli woman, but I am also a literary scholar who believes in the universal power of art, she wrote.Ben Judah, a British author and journalist, also condemned the decision. Depressing and unpleasant that Sally Rooney won’t allow her new novel to be translated into Hebrew, he wrote on Twitter.All three of Rooney\u0027s novels have been showered with praise by critics for her minimalist writing style and melancholy depiction of life in post-financial crisis Ireland. The novels also address tensions between Ireland\u0027s working and middle classes.In the UK she has received four book awards, including Young Writer of the Year by the Sunday Times in 2017 and the Costa Book award in 2018.Normal People, which follows the on-off relationship between Marianne Sheridan and Connell Waldron during their youth, was adapted into an acclaimed BBC series in 2020.In an interview with The  in 2018, Rooney said that she struggled with socialising while growing up, despite her newfound status as the voice of the so-called millennial generation.I thought school was immensely boring and, as a teenager, I often found social life quite mystifying…I was not someone to whom it came easily to be charming, she said.A spokesman for Modan confirmed that it would not be publishing Rooney\u0027s third novel but declined to say whether this was due to a boycott, and instead referred The  to Rooney\u0027s agent.More from NewsIreland’s Brexit hardliners are playing with fireInside Rikers Island, where detainees have taken over notorious New York prisonBritons cut ties with formal attire as sales of loungewear soar during lockdownsHolocaust: Birth certificate of survivor born in concentration camp to be shown at Imperial War Museum‘Shambolic’ MoD spends twice as much on land as it does on nuclear deterrentNearly 6,000 new homes will be built on brownfield land by 2024, vows Michael GoveMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tuesday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Tuesday.

The study, from the cross-party Science and Technology Committee and the Health and Social Care Committee, said the UK’s preparation for a pandemic was far too focused on flu, while ministers waited too long to push through lockdown measures in early . In a wide-ranging report, MPs said the UK’s pandemic planning was too “narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model” that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola. Here are eight key findings from the report:Preparedness The Governmentaposs pandemic planning was too narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola. The national risk register predicted that the likelihood of an emerging infectious disease spreading within the UK was lower than that of a flu pandemic, with only up to  people dying. The report recommended that experts from abroad should help draw up plans while specialists should scan the horizon for future threats. Army logistics experts should play a more central role in preparing for pandemics. Herd immunity While allowing people to become infected early on to reach herd immunity was not an official Government strategy, there was a policy approach of fatalism about the spread of the virus. This led to a strategy of only trying to moderate the speed of infection through the population - flattening the curve - rather than stopping its spread. SAGE experts believed completely suppressing the virus would cause a second peak.Lockdowns Ministers took a gradual and incremental approach to restrictions such as social distancing, isolation and lockdowns and MPs said it was astonishing that it took so long for them to realise this was a catastrophically wrong decision that would dramatically increase the death toll. There was a  belief the public would not accept a lockdown and lack of testing meant there was little data on Covid spread. Ministers ignored scientic advice for a two-week circuit breaker in autumn which could have saved thousands of lives and meant there was a month-long lockdown - apart from schools - in November instead. The PM announced a third lockdown on January  . Restrictions The Government was too slow to bring in self-isolation rules while light-touch border controls only on countries with high Covid rates meant the arrival of more cases from countries like France and Spain. Regional tiers brought in last October were not watertight enough to prevent infection spreading. Scientic evidence for measures like the pm curfew on pubs was lacking. Tougher social distancing measures last autumn could have stopped the spread of the Alpha iant across the country and saved more lives.  Social care Social care had a less prominent voice in Government in the early stages of the pandemic than did the NHS. The decision not to test people being discharged from hospitals to care homes early on was a failure and led to deaths in care homes. Staff shortages, the lack of testing and dficulties in obtaining PPE all hampered isolation and infection control. The social care sector remains drastically in need of funding and reform - or it will be at risk from future pandemics. Health inequalities There were unacceptably high death rates among people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, the MPs concluded. Increased exposure to Covid as a result of peopleaposs housing and working conditions played a signicant role. BAME staff in the NHS, often in more junior positions, faced greater dficulty getting appropriate PPE equipment. There were also disproportionately high mortality rates among people with learning dficulties and autism - in part because of pre-existing health conditions but also dficulties accessing care. The experience of the covid pandemic underlines the need for an urgent and long term strategy to tackle health inequalities, they concluded.  Testing The slow, uncertain, and often chaotic performance of the £ billion test, trace and isolate system severely hampered the UKaposs response to the pandemic, the MPs found. Test and trace failed in its stated objective to prevent future lockdowns - despite vast quantities of taxpayersapos money. The report concluded were it not for the NHS vaccines programme further lockdown restrictions would have been needed in summer . Vaccines MPs praised ministers for identying that a vaccine would be a long-term route out of the pandemic and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance for setting up the Vaccines Taskforce to procure jabs. The Government was right to support vaccine research and development, including the Oxford AstraZeneca jab, while the NHS successfully handled the roll-out of the programme, with over % of the adult population jabbed by September . But the conclusion that the vaccine programme has redeemed many of the Governmentaposs other failings - which resulted in , deaths - will be controversial.

CF Fertilisers, Britain’s main carbon dioxide producer, was forced to close down two of its UK plants - Cheshire and Billingham - last month following the rising price of gas. The shortage had a major impact on numerous industries because CO is needed to stun animals for slaughter, produce fizzy drinks, extend the shelf le of food, help surgical operations and cool nuclear power plants. In September, the government agreed to spend millions of pounds on bailing out CF Fertilisers – a private US firm – so that it could restart production at the Teesside factory.  Ministers have now brokered a longer-term deal, lasting until January, which will allow the plant to charge signicantly more for CO in the coming months to ensure production remains viable.It is unclear how much more companies will have to paybut food producers could face a possible fivefold spike in the cost of CO that could ultimately impact food prices.It comes as retail industry experts warned that shoppers could face “disruption and frustration” over the festive period amid empty shelves as hundreds of thousands of people have started to stockpile groceries for Christmas.According to the , there is speculation that prices of CO could jump from £ to as much as £, a tonne. The British Meat Processors Association said: The industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward. We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work.” The deal was welcomed by Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, but he added: The increased cost of buying CO is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. “This will of course add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners.  Carbon dioxide is a by-product of fertiliser manufacture and CF supplies around  per cent of the UK’s needs. Following the government’s new deal, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said “critical industries can have confidence in their supplies of CO over the coming months without further taxpayer support.” But there are fears that yesterday’s announcement does not address the industry’s dependency on a small number of companies that are at the mercy of gas prices.The UK is facing a cost of living crisis, with inflation having seen a record spike in August. In addition, the coronavirus pandemic has heavily impacted global supply chains.It comes a day after the boss of Kraft Heinz – the world’s fth-largest food and drink company –warned people will have to get used to higher food prices.Supermarket bosses in the UK – which faces the dual shock of Brexit and the pandemic – have recently warned of worsening conditions for consumers, such as rising prices and emptier shelves.Despite the rise in food and energy prices, the government has pushed ahead with scrapping the £-per-week universal credit uplt introduced during the pandemic. The government said: CO suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer.

Claire, from Criccieth, North Wales, said: It started when I was around  or . I worked in a chemist, and I used to want to buy sponges so I could eat them.

Some sponges are the wrong texture, and you canapost rip it. If I have a sponge, I keep it in my bedroom drawer and take two to three bites a day so it will last for around a week.” Claires says she knows her eating habits aren’t good for her, and even feels “relieved” when she’s finished a sponge. She added: When itaposs gone, I feel relieved and stop myself from buying another one. I try really hard not to. I bought one a few months ago, started eating it then threw it in the bin because I know I shouldnapost. I do worry about whether Iaposm digesting it. Claire’s cravings get worse when she’s on her period, stressed, or tired, and they were particularly hard to resist when she was pregnant with her sons, William, , and Sam, .

At the beginning of my pregnancy it was bad because I was tired, but I was worried for health reasons, so I tried my hardest not to.

Sinead Bowlesapos devastated parents Andy and Anita Bowles say she had shown no signs of feeling depressed or having mental health issues.The -year-old, who was a team leader at Alton Towers, had been furloughed during the pandemic and just “put her head down” to get on with her university studies, StokeonTrentLive reports. Then, days before her death, she had gone out with friends and contracted Covid. Her father, Andy, said: “I think her feelings came on quickly. She just felt she’d got Covid and was locked up.  “Like a lot of parents who are in this position, the common denominator is you never expect your child to take that course of action.” Sinead had just completed the second year of her degree course at Staffordshire University and wanted to study for a master’s at Cambridge. She was found dead at her family home in Hanley, Staffordshire, on July . An inquest on Monday heard that Sinead’s best friend Keisha Nichols, who lived next door, had raised the alarm after realising she hadn’t let her dog out. Earlier that day, Sinead had also sent a worrying text, saying: “I genuinely wish I could go to sleep and not wake up.” By the time she was found with several ‘goodbye’ notes on her bed, it was too late for paramedics to save her. Sinead had found an interest in helping to turn round the lives of former prisoners, and was doing a podcast with Keisha, in which they would talk about positive ways to improve mental health. Sineadaposs mum Anita, said: “She also had a passion for Men Unite and helping others.” After losing her grandparents aged , she had “started to focus on le again” in the months leading up to her death, Anita said. “As part of her university course, she went to visit prisons around the UK, which she loved. She was a natural in talking to people.” Her parents, who are orced, said she had been a “shining light in our lives and was loved dearly by her family and many friends”. Concluding the death was the result of suicide, North Staffordshire senior coroner Andrew Barkley said Covid may have been a factor in what happened, although it was unclear. The family have raised more than £, for the charity Young Minds in her memory.

But mum Kayleigh, , said things went downhill from there. A midwe visited and decided to send the baby to Arrowe Park Hospital where doctors tried to feed him.Kayleigh told the Liverpool Echo : When we got him to Arrowe Park, we got him to take about ml of a feed, and that was what tipped him over the edge basically, that little, tiny couple of mils.It hit his tummy and his belly just swelled signicantly. It went really big and hard. Kayleigh was shocked and scared, wondering what was happening with her baby while doctors examined Micah and tubes ran through his nose to his stomach.  She said: It was quite frightening. Iaposd never experienced anything like it before. As a parent whoaposs already had children, you take for granted that your baby is going to be born okay.

And you expect to go home and everything be hunky dory and you get to spend time with the rest of your family. Our other children just didnapost really get to see Micah. They were in school and he got rushed off to hospital.  Kayleigh added: You have nine months of imagining. For me, that was the hard part at the beginning. You spend nine months imagining what leaposs going to be like when your baby is born. And you have this idea that youaposre going to bring your baby home, and youaposre going to be able to introduce the baby to your family properly. Micah didnapost meet a lot of his family for quite some time because of being in hospital. He wasnapost able to be around his siblings as much. After being transferred to Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital and undergoing tests, Micah was diagnosed with Hirschsprung’s disease. The congenital condition affecting one in , in the UK meant the nerves in his bowel didnapost fully develop while in the womb. Kayleighaposs baby boy was kept at Alder Hey for two weeks, having a stoma formed in theatre before being sent home to his three older siblings. The mum of four sings the hospitalaposs praises for how the staff treated them during their initial stay and since. Kayleigh said: Theyaposre just fantastic, they really are. Theyaposre such an amazing team of people. We were blessed to have such really, really inspirational people taking care of our baby. They knew what they were doing. And they taught Kayleigh what to do too, guiding her through how to clean the stoma bag and care for baby Micah. Hirschsprungaposs disease is incurable but can be treated and his mum is grateful for Alder Heyaposs support.She said: Theyaposll monitor him because they can be quite prone to having problems with their bowels as they get older. Itaposs quite important to myself and dad and the siblings, to not only raise awareness for Alder Hey and how amazing they are, but also for Hirschprungaposs disease because it is so rare. When someone says, aposOh why has he got that stoma bag apos, you say heaposs got Hirschsprung’s disease and they donapost actually know what it is. And thereaposs such a stigma around having a stoma as well. Saturday just gone was Stoma Awareness Day. Itaposs important to raise awareness that thataposs what saves our baby.

And as Black History Month continues, there is no better opportunity to reflect upon the brave heroes, tragedies and landmark events you might not have been taught about at school.Earlier this month, the Mirror brought you the story of former head teacher Betty Campbell – the first black woman in Wales to hold such a title, who also became the first woman in Wales to have a public statue unveiled in her memory.Beginning her career in , Betty was a pioneering force in British education, but  years on representation in our classrooms is still sorely lacking. Almost half of all schools in England have no black or minority ethnic teachers, according to a recent report by UCL’s Institute for Education - while there are growing calls to aposdecolonialiseapos the curriculum in the wake of last yearaposs Black Lives Matter protests. Here, campaigner and activist Professor Patrick Vernon OBE, the co-author of  Great Black Britons, sheds light on seminal moments of black history that should be taught in our classrooms.

However, while it proved to be the catalyst for the abolition of slavery across the Caribbean and North America, it was actually not until  that slavery was abolished in Brazil.  Windrush generation changed the face of Britain The Empire Windrush docked in Tilbury on June ,  from Jamaica, bringing to our shores a erse mix of communities from the Caribbean. Arriving during an acute labour shortage, the  passengers and crew quickly became the backbone of institutions like the NHS and key industries including transport and manufacturing. In short, the Windrush Generation has helped to transform Britain into a successful multicultural society over the last  years alongside other migrant communities.  Yet in , as result of the hostile immigration policy of the Government, more than , people - many from the Caribbean - saw their lives suddenly uprooted. The British citizens, who had the right to settle in the UK, were denied NHS treatment and legal rights, wrongly detained, or in some cases deported. A public outcry and campaign forced the Government to do a U-turn in immigration policy. In , a national Windrush Day was established to recognise the legacy and achievement of the Windrush Generation. The UKaposs aposRosa Parks momentapos Dubbed aposthe mother of the freedom movementapos, Rosa Parks famously started the Montgomery bus boycott when she refused to give up her seat for a white passenger in Alabama on December , . This became a pivotal moment in the establishment of the civil rights movement in the US, which sought to end racial segregation and remove the legal barriers to voting and education for African Americans.  You may not know that in Britain, a similar boycott was led in . Civil rights activist Paul Stevenson took a stand against the Bristol Omnibus bus service, which operated an employment colour bar. The campaign not only led to the company changing its policy of recruiting black and other minority ethnic staff, but also helped to shape the first legislation in Britain on race discrimination in . Racist murders that sparked national outrage In , Kelso Cochrane, a black man, was murdered by a gang of white youths in west London. The police failed to investigate and to catch the murderers. In response to the scandal, activist and publisher Claudia Jones organised a series of events to celebrate Caribbean culture in the face of the hate from the white racists. This eventually led to the formation of what we today know as Notting Hill Carnival.  Nearly three decades later, Stephen Lawrence was murdered at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London. His parents, Doreen and Neville, spearheaded the campaign to arrest and convict his murderers. It took  years for the two killers, David Norris and Gary Dobson, to finally be put behind bars. The Lawrencesapos campaign led to a public inquiry that culminated in the MacPherson report, which contained sweeping recommendations on policy addressing institutional racism in public bodies. This eventually became legislation under the Race Relation Amendment of . Deadly tragedies that rocked black communities Between May  and June , , the Tulsa race massacre became one of the most serious episodes of racial violence against African Americans in the history of the US. A thriving black area, Greenwood - aposdubbed aposBlack Wall Streetapos – was terrorised by white mobs, resulting in the estimated deaths of up to  people.  A further , were left homeless in Tulsa, Oklahoma, while , business premises and whole neighbourhood blocks were destroyed. Largely ignored by for many decades in the US, there is now a growing awareness about the tragedy with books, television programmes and campaigns from the families calling for justice and a formal inquiry. On January , ,  young African-Caribbeans enjoying a party in south London died in the New Cross fire. The blaze, believed to have been set by racist thugs, is one of the biggest tragedies the black British community has faced. Not recognised by the police as a racist attack, the horric loss of le led to a national demonstration called Black People’s Day of Action that saw more than , people march from south to central London demanding justice. Forty years later the campaign is still ongoing. Pioneering women who broke political mould Over the decades, a number of game-changing women have paved the way for black representation in the often narrow halls of politics. In January , Shirley Chisholm was confirmed as the first African American woman elected to Congress.  Just this year, Kamala Harris became the first female US Vice President and the first African American to hold the office. Dame Mary Eugenia Charles, the Caribbean’s first female prime minister, took charge of Dominica from  to  - making her one of the longest running black head of estate in history.Although Kwame Nkrumah became the first elected leader of Ghana in  - the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence - and Nelson Mandela became the first black President of South Africa in , we had to wait until  for Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to become Africa’s first elected female as head of state of Liberia. In the UK, Diane Abbott became the first black female MP in , while Baroness Valerie Amos was the first black female leader of the House of Lords in .Joanne Anderson was elected the new Mayor of Liverpool in May , becoming the first black woman to run a major city. She was only the second black person in history to do so - following Marvin Rees, who was elected Mayor of Bristol in . Proud roots of Black History Month The Roaring Twenties wasnapost felt by all Americans - a decade when lynching was common, white supremacy was rampant and African Americans had no rights and privileges. But in , the historian Carter Woodson launched Negro History Week - a precursor to Black History Month - in an effort to develop and promote black racial pride and celebrate achievement. Black History Month itself was established in Britain back in  by Akyaaba Addai-Sebo. The Ghanaian activist pushed for the annual event in the aftermath of uprisings in Brixton, Toxteth, St Paulaposs and Tottenham - sparked over issues of policing, racism and mass unemployment of black youths, as well as the growing campaign to end Apartheid in South Africa. Black History Month has since influenced the establishment of other history months such as LGBTQ, Travellers, and South East Asian History Month.Professor Patrick Vernon OBE is the co-author of  Great Black Britons.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing webfeatures@trinitymirror Comment MORE ON Black History Month\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

NHS worker Kyrie Jagger, , and her partner, Andy Phillips, , have working on the transformation since last September. They began decorating their semi-detached home after just four weeks of moving in. The project has cost around £, so far, consisting of original patterned wallpaper and authentically sourced s furniture. Kyrie said: “We didn’t ever have a plan, but it has all come together so well. “We both share a love for the décor of the s and it has sort of been like our lockdown project. “Andy has been amazing with the decorating, and I have often sourced the furniture, we are a good team when it comes to design.  The content of the house has been sourced from all over the UK, such as car boots and charity shops, with the couple keen to keep things as original as possible. She added: “It has not been as expensive as first thought we try to look for the best prices as buying a house requires most of your savings.“We have found a lot of items from car boot sales, flea markets, charity shops and websites like eBay and Facebook Marketplace.“I have actually been noticing prices goingrecently so it can be tough to find things for the right prices, but we check most days.” Kyrie gained a lot of inspiration from her grandparent’s house, which used to feature a lot of original furniture. She explained: “They had a lot of G Plan branded stuff and Tique furniture, which was the exact sort of style we have tried to emulate. “It is all so well made it holds up even today as just timeless furniture.  “At this moment in time, like every piece of furniture is original apart from our sofa and bed which we are in the process of looking to replace. “We do also have a modern TV and computers as well as it can be very hard to be entirely authentic!” Kyrie’s favourite room of the house so far is the bedroom, which was designed all around the wallpaper. She added:” One of the first things we did was find this amazing pink, orange and brown garish pattern wallpaper, which I adore. “All of our wallpaper is original so itaposs so hard to find.” Kyrie’s love for the s first began at a young age, with her parents playing a lot of the classic s hits when she was growing up. She said: “ To this day, Queen are still my favourite band. They are just an absolute staple for all music lovers. “This was certainly what gave me my first insight into the era, and over time I just learned to love it more. “Both mine and Andy’s homes were very minimalistic in design growing up, so we almost rebelled against the designs we were used to and the love for s aesthetic evolved over time.” Kyrie also keeps a wardrobe of original s clothing, which she frequently wears.  She added: “I love the clothing and try to source a lot of original s clothing as well, I believe you have got to truly immerse yourself in the era. “The sense of freedom, the colour and the fashion have all been a major influence on my le.” The couple’s friends and families have had mixed feelings when coming to visit the retro home. Kyrie said: “A few guests that visit do not really mention anything about the décor, and we think our parents get reminded of their parents houses, so they aren’t so keen on it. “However, most of our friends love it. They are normally surprised with how good it is in real le.” Comment MORE ON property news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When her cheque was revealed, Kath celebrated by giving her partner of over  years, Alan, a big hug and a kiss. She went on to add: “I cannot believe this, I cannot believe this money! “I’ve been at this postcode for  years – good things come to those who wait!” NG  was announced as August’s Postcode Millions winner on Saturday th August. Kath and six of her neighbours won £, each, the biggest share of the £. million prize, thanks to playing with the full winning postcode – NG NL. Two of her neighbours increased their prizes to £, and £, thanks to playing with two and four tickets.Kath, a retired factory machinist, started sewing scrubs and masks for NHS and care home staff after seeing a request on Facebook. She said: “I knew the NHS needed help so I just did what I could. I made hundreds, they went to local hospitals, doctors’ surgeries and care homes. “It was hard work but it didn’t matter – I knew it was all going to a good cause.” Community-minded Kath also plans to spend a portion of her prize by buying a defibrillator for the local Post Office. She said: “We had a defibrillator that was vandalised and we’ve been raising money to have it replaced but we need more than one, so I’m going to get one for the Post Office.” With four grandchildren, Kath’s biggest plans for her prize involve treating them. She said: “I’ve just called them on FaceTime and given £, away already! We don’t necessarily want much for ourselves and Alan has Parkinson’s so we won’t be going on a big holiday, instead we’ll do what we can to help others.” Kath went on to joke: “If Alan’s lucky he might get the £ that’s left over!” Also winning big was Kath’s next-door neighbour of  years, -year-old Wayne Smith. Wayne was in disbelief when he was contacted by the lottery, but once he realised it was the real deal, he said he was ‘shaking like a leaf and crying’ at the prospect of winning. He was joined by his we of  years, Tracey, when he discovered his prize amount and was speechless for a few moments before he said: “That’s brill. It’s a once in a letime thing!” Tracey, who has lived on the winning street all her le, was teary eyed when she saw the sum. She said: “Oh my God, wow. It doesn’t seem real. It seems like a dream. I’m going to have to pinch myself to wake myself up. “You don’t think people like us will win it – we’re not posh, we’re down to earth! “It’s a dream, it’s everything.” With three children and four grandchildren, Tracey says the whole family has won: “We’re all going to benefit from this. We’ll look after them all.” The pair also have a few plans to treat themselves too. Tracey, who was made redundant last year but now works as a production operative at a pudding factory, commented: “We can get the house done up properly now, which we’ve never been able to do. “It’s my th birthday next year too, I’ll be flying out to Gran Canaria now!” Asked how they’d be celebrating, Wayne replied: “Babysitting! But we’ll get a takeaway and have a bottle too.” Wayne and Tracey were delighted to have won alongside next-door neighbours Kath and Alan.  Tracey said: “Kath would be sewing for hours and hours, you could hear her machine going and then there were scrubs hanging all along the washing line drying. She sewed a little tag with a ‘love you’ inside every set of scrubs too. “When Kath won the award, she said she didn’t think she deserved it because she just did her little bit. You couldn’t ask for better neighbours.” Another big winner on the street was -year-old Chris Neale who also took home £,. After catching a glimpse of his prize cheque, he said: “Wow! Thank you very much. Iaposm sure the kids will help me spend that.” Chris, who works as a wood machinist for a furniture company has always had a dream car in mind. He said: “I’ll probably buy an old car, Mk  Ford EscortI can get a hold of one. I’ve always wanted one, I’ve even got a little picture of it in my shed. “Youaposve made my dreams come true.” Prize amounts for the other players in the winning sector ranged from £, to £, depending on the number of tickets played with. People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson said: “It was an absolute pleasure to deliver some good news to Kath, Wayne, Chris and their families today. “I’ve loved hearing their plans for their winnings and I’m sure there will be lots of celebrations going on in NG  this bank holiday weekend!” People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day.

The other driver Carl Kidd who was taking his heavily pregnant partner to see his parents told the hearing: aposaposShe was well over on my side of the road and she was coming at speed. I steered away to avoid a head on collision but she caught the back end of my car. aposaposI made sure my partner was okay then went over to confronted her the other driver. She then opened the door and there were three kids in the back and a young girl in the passenger seat, all children. aposaposShe got out and abruptly walked over to my car. I said: aposlook what you have done apos and asked for her insurance details but she offered me £, to not go through the insurance. aposaposI said there wasn’t a chance of that because the chassis was bent over where she had hit me and we went over it back and forth. I asked her again for her insurance details and eventually she gave them, got into her car and sped off. I then rang the police and got nothing  other than her name, insurance company and I had taken a picture of her registration. “She appeared to be intoxicated and was slurring her words and was unsteady on her feet. I think she was trying to overpower me. I did not smell any alcohol but she was slurring her words. I have been around drunk people in my le and she did not appear to be sober. She appeared drunk to me and my partner agreed she didn’t seem right.aposapos aposThe court heard police arrived at Ridingsapos home at .pm where she was said to have an aposaposelevating demeanour.aposapos After blowing almost four times the limit she took a second test which showed she had mg in breath. Ridings told the hearing: aposaposI was coming round a bend and was going down the hill but as I accelerated the car skidded and I have clipped the other car. I did say: aposcan we not go with insuranceapos as I had £, in savings which I could use. I said my premiums were really high as it is due to my vehicle being a sports car and because of my age. But he said it would be more than that and something needed to happen that day. I felt uncomfortable. It was only minor damage - just a scrape. There was more damage to my car. I had not had any alcohol by that stage. “I drove off because other cars were beeping and he was aggressive and the kids were screaming. We were not getting anywhere. I went to Paige’s house and there I was trying to calm down and I asked her to get me a drink. aposaposI was wanting to get picked up, I was shook up and had had a drink. I had two big drinks before I left her house and I got a lt home. He had been aggressive with me when he didn’t really have a right to. aposaposI got into the car and drove off to Paige’s. Everything was happening too fast and the kids were hysterical. At Paige’s I was panicking and asked her to get me a strong drink. I just needed to calm my nerves and I stood outside her house having a glass a of vodka which more or less neat and I then necked it then had another one whilst I was getting the kids out of my car and into my friends van.aposapos Breaking down in tears she added: “I just feel like a bad mum drinking. I was there - minutes and it was long enough to have two drinks. I just panicked. They were incredibly strong drinks. I had not had a drink before it.aposapos Miss Azad, a care assistant told JPs: aposaposWhen I saw her she was distraught and crying her eyes out - but was not under the influence of alcohol, no way. She said: aposcan you make me a drinkapos and I saw a litre of vodka. Itaposs all my fault as I might as well have given her the whole litre of vodka. I am not going to lie. She just necked it. aposaposI just wanted to calm her nerves and to calm her down whilst she was arranging a lt on her phone. I saw the vodka used a tall pint glass and put in a lot of vodka. aposaposI got her another drink and she necked that one too. I would never let her drink drive home. Prosecutor Nick Smart told the hearing: “Mr Kidd gave a breathtakingly honest account about the incident. He was always going to be angry and upset. This lady was said to be distraught whilst her animated friend gave her a drink. It does not pan out. “The situation was fraught with emotion, one party had children in the car the other party had a heavily pregnant woman. It is very easy to say I would not drive because it would put my children’s safety at risk but a lot of people do drink and drive. It is quite common regrettably. People who have had a drink make ill-founded decisions and that is what has happened in this case.” But defence lawyer Dave Holland said: aposaposThe two of them had a conversation lasting - minutes and whilst Mr Kidd had some suspicions she was drunk, he could not be sure and he could not smell alcohol. He accepted he became aggressive and she felt threatened. She has never been in trouble before.aposapos In clearing Ridings, the chairman of the bench who would only give her name as Mrs Furness said: aposaposMr Kidd was clear and credible. Miss Ridings was often confused, emotional at times and misleading. The other lady, Paige was totally incredible. aposaposHowever, the prosecution have not proved beyond reasonable doubt this case. There is insufficient evidence to prove you were over the limit at the time of the incident or at the time of consuming. We therefore find you not guilty.” As Ridings and Miss Azad celebrated outside, prosecutors questioned the verdict but Mrs Furness insisted: aposWe believe the Crown’s case has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. We are not prepared to go into it anymore.” Comment MORE ON Mercedes BenzPregnancyCourt caseAlcoholCar crashesDrink-driving\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The court heard the man fell in love with CaplanLouise Caplan arriving at Aylesbury Crown Court Image: Vagner Vidal Hyde News  Pictures LtdByJames Llewelyn:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA -year-old escort conned her sugar daddy out of £. million after he fell in love with her, a court heard. Henry Sless, a retired Deloitteaposs executive, found escort girl Louise Caplan online and they started dating, despite their -year age gap. The court heard Caplan asked the millionaire to be her sugar daddy in exchange for £,-a-year, but Mr Sless managed to negotiate the fee down to £, a month. Both Caplan and Mr Sless lived in upmarket Buckinghamshire, the woman in the village of Chalfont St. Giles and Mr Sless in the town of Marlow, the court heard. Prosecutors told the judge that Caplan bought herself a £ million house with Mr Slessapos money which she obtained by lying that she was investing in businesses in Dubai and Dublin. She also bought artwork worth £,. Mr Sless, who was  years old at the time, showered Caplan with gts worth more than £ million. He also parted with another £. million which he wrongly believed the wannabe businesswoman was investing, Aylesbury Crown Court heard. Jon Swaine, defence counsel for Caplan, said: It was a sad situation of two people who had fantasies. Each had their own fantasy. Hers was that she wanted to be a successful businesswoman and his came at a time when he was unhappy in his personal le. He made decisions that were disastrous and astonishing for a man with his expertise and background. The decisions he made were not made using his head, that is for sure. Judge Francis Sheridan heard the couple met via the online escort website Adult Works in November  after Mr Sless agreed to pay her £ for sex. Prosecutor Stefan Weidmann said: Mr Sless said in a statement aposit felt like we clicked immediately and within a few days of our first meeting Ms Caplan sent a message saying she would have married meI would have been  years younger and she was  years older. We met five or so times in the first year and we were in contact on a daily basis. I instantly fell for her. As the relationship developed, Caplan began to demand money from Mr Sless, the court heard. In a statement, Mr Sless said: Sometime in late November or early December , Ms Caplan came to me and asked meI would be her apossugar daddyapos. She asked me to give her £, a year, I negotiated it down to £, per month. Judge Francis Sheridan heard how the wealthy tax executive showered Caplan with gts worth £ million over the course of their relationship. It was also revealed that the couple had met on at least six occasions for sex, although the judge suggested it could have been more times. However, the court heard that the escort defrauded him out of at least £. million.  Caplan spent more than £ million on a luxury house in Farnham Common, as well as nearly £, on artwork and £, on luxury retail goods, despite having previously had an annual income of only £,, the court heard. The judge was told that despite the loans Mr Sless was handing out, the veteran accountant did not demand any paperwork. Prosecutor Stefan Weidmann said: When asked why he would give such enormous loans on an informal basis Mr Sless said he the pair to be in a long term relationship and he believed that they had a future together and they would be married and together raise Ms Caplanaposs daughter. However, Judge Sheridan questioned: Of course he would have had paperwork, he was an accountant  What am I missing   Mr Weidmann admitted that Mr Sless was a man of staggering naivety, despite his vast experience. He had believed that the money was going to be spent on property development in Dublin and Dubai, despite having seen only very limited evidence of their existence. Earlier, the hearing had been delayed by nearly three hours after Caplan had to be examined under the mental health act. During the hearing, the escort was often tearful and was visibly emotional at the mention of her daughter. Defending her, Mr Swaine revealed that she had attempted to use the money genuinely to pursue her dream of becoming a successful interior designer, and it was only when the bills began to catch up with her that she turned to fraud. He said: She intended to use this money in a business but she was hopelessly out of her depth. She hired expensive accountants who advised her that she had no hope of success. Her huge error was not to go to Mr Sless and say I have been stupid and I have let you down. She had no hope of paying this all back. Caplan had earlier admitted one count of fraud. She arrived at Aylesbury Crown Court to hear her fate carrying a Louis Vuitton designer bag containing personal possessions to take into prison. Sentencing her to five and a quarter years in prison, Judge Sheridan said: I am in no position to tell the truth of how many times he took advantage of your sexual services. It was at least six times but I am strongly suspicious about that given the extremely large figures in this fraud. This had all the hallmarks of a business arrangement andit was business, it was certainly not done properly. As she was led away, Caplan remained standing in the dock, before she waved to her mother, who sat in the public gallery, and told her to pass on her love to her daughter.

The  film then cuts to another home where a man reaches for a book.I thought of that scene when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp went down for several hours twice last week.Far from panicking at my place, we actually managed to get a few things done. Yes the service outage was a reminder that we rely far too heavily on the information super-highway. But it was also a chance to remember some of the other things out there to enjoy, particularly in a society that speaks to each other less and less. The service outage couldn’t have been better timed, either. It came as US whistleblower Frances Haugen, an ex-Facebook employee, revealed thousands of pages of internal research suggesting that the firm was – and still is – well aware of the harm its content can cause. And yet it does nothing about it. I suspect I was among many parents reminding their children – and themselves – that the whole unseemly episode was a warning. Mainly that we should not leave ourselves at the mercy of a company that, in the opinion of many, places profit over our wellbeing. In addition, the idea that Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg would go on holiday rather than defend himself in person over the allegations seemed ridiculous. As ludicrous as believing civil servants working from home here were responsible for leaving Afghan translators behind to their fate at the hands of the Taliban. It helped, however, to make the point superbly. Zero accountability at a time when we need answers, with our mental health at stake. We use social media for so much, too much, these days. We are a society endlessly running our index finger down a bit of plastic in an interconnected world. Last week was a glimpse at an alternative reality. I wouldn’t mind a third outage, maybe for a week or so please.

Sophie Taylor and her partner James Waite, both , arrived with their children Ruby, two, and Thomas, four, at their two-bedroom home in Cheadle, Staffordshire in June.They previously lived in a flat in Worcestershire and moved to the Sanctuary Housing property so James - who suffers with poor mental health - could enjoy the outside space.But rather than finding a happy home, the family were faced with a catalogue of complaints, including missing bins, an unlevel garden, holes in the drive, and a condemned garage. Sophie told Stoke on Trent Live: “We wanted a bigger house and a new beginning somewhere.  Do you have a story that you think we should cover  Get in touch with us at webnews@mirror“At the time we were elated we were moving in. When we moved in the property needed decorating. The grass was ft high in the garden. “We moved here on the basis of having a garden for outdoor space for my partner. Due to his disability we needed a lot of space. “But we can’t use the garden at all. It’s so unlevel and there are holes in the ground.We’ve been told that the garage has been condemned because it’s so lopsided that it needs to be knocked down and rebuilt again. “The concrete at the back of the garden and the driveway is full of cracks and holes. It’s five-inch deep holes, it’s disgusting.  “The front lawn and everything needs redoing. The brick wall at the front is falling down. “The whole structure of the house needs to be done.” Sophie says she expects compensation and a bigger property for the issues the young family had to deal with.She also wants repairs to be carried, which are estimated to run to £,. Sophie, a housing officer, added: “My children can’t go out in the garden. It’s disgusting. I want to move now. The neighbours are making comments about how horrible the house looks.  “Everyone ’s houses look really nice and then you’ve got this house which is an absolute shambles. The only thing I can use my garden for is putting the washing on a line. “I had the six-week holiday with the kids and I had to stay in the house or take them out because I can’t use the garden. “What I would like out of all of this is a usable house that is a three-bedroom. I want compensation for all the inconveniences because we’ve had to live here from June to now and nothing has been done. “They are telling me they are sending people out to me and they don’t.

Immunity against bugs is said to be so low after lockdowns that bugs could kill ,, expert modelling reveals. Free flu jabs will be offered to  million most at risk, with Professor Jonathan Van-Tam today urging Britons to get jabbed as a war on flu begins.

Prof Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: “Not many people got flu last year because of Covid- restrictions, so there isn’t as much natural immunity in our communities as usual. “We will see flu circulate this winter. It might be higher than usual and that makes it a signicant public health concern. Covid- will still be circulating and with more people mixing indoors, sadly some increases are possible. For the first time we will have Covid- and flu co-circulating.

Grace Baker-Earle developed chronic fatigue syndromeafter her battle with the virus before being mobbed by more than a dozen protestors outside Cardfaposs Bayside mass vaccination centre. The -year-oldaposs mum Angela was putting her wheelchair in the car when the group approached and made for an incredibly unpleasant situation. I said my daughter is using a wheelchair because of Covid, explained Angela, , from Cowbridge, in the Vale Glamorgan, Wales. A protestor said: aposSheaposll have immunity, you shouldnapost be getting the vaccine since you have natural immunity. You shouldnapost be using her as a lab rat.apos Grace - who fell ill with pneumonia last November before contracting coronavirus earlier this year and then developing Myalgic Encephalomyelitis - was left feeling intimidated and sad by the unruly mob.ME is a long-term illness with a wide range of symptoms, the most common of which is extreme tiredness.The protesters were eventually ushered away by a steward from the centre, who then checked the mum and daughter were okay, reports the BBC.  Grace said: I think I was sad more than anything because itaposs something I still live with, it takes up every second of my day. She added that she had been looking forward to getting the jab. South Wales Police have confirmed a -year-old man from Newport, South Wales, has been arrested in connection with the incident. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, meanwhile, condemned the group.  People are entitled to protest, people are entitled to express their view. Theyaposre not entitled to do it in a way that intimidates others, he said. When youaposre talking about harassment, itaposs not what the person who is making the protests thinks about it, itaposs the impact that has on the inidual.. Very clearly in this case, that young woman felt intimidated. South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said: Iaposm very angry about the attitude of these particular protesters, because what theyaposre protesting about is crazy nonsense. It could put some people off being vaccinated and clearly itaposs unacceptable in the sort of example thataposs mentioned. Itaposs a dficult balance because itaposs a matter for the whole of society. Why is it that we have this group of iniduals who are completely ignoring the evidence about vaccination  But the responsibility of the police is to keep that balance right.

Jan Holman, , was admitted to hospital six weeks ago and is now a patient at the Hospice of the Good Shepherd in Chester. Her quick referral to the hospice meant she hadnapost had a chance to say goodbye to her dogs, Monty and Rowley, or Bob, her horse of  years. Due to the pandemic Jan was unable to have any visitors at the hospital, and her husband of  years, Dennis, said she found having no visitors or personal contact dficult. After four weeks, Jan was moved to the hospice to receive end-of-le care. Knowing Jan was also missing her animals, the hospice arranged for a visit from her two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Monty and Rowley, as well as her horse, Bob. Even though she was unable to get out of bed, Jan was excited to have the chance to see the gang one more time. Dennis said: “It was just such a relief once Jan was moved from the hospital to the hospice in Chester and we were able to have named visitors who could come and see Jan regularly, however we never imagined that we would be able to include Monty, Rowley and Bob on the visiting list.”  He continued: “All the staff here have been wonderful. Jan has been so well cared for, nothing is too much trouble even down to the chef coming every day to see what he can tempt Jan to eat. Nothing is too much trouble, including arranging for a horse to visit!” Before her illness Jan, who has lived in Chester all of her le, could be seen dressed as Chesteraposs Tudor Lady delivering tours of the city where she has been a Blue Badge Tour Guide for  years. Jan said: “I just can’t believe what the staff here at the hospice have done for me. Until a few weeks ago I was still riding Bob every day and he is such an important part of my le, and I have missed him so much. I knew that arranging for my dogs to visit was possible as we had a neighbour who was a patient at the hospice a few years ago and we were allowed to bring the dogs to visit her, but I just didn’t expect that they would ever be able to give me the chance to see Bob one more time.”  Louise Saville King, deputy ward manager at the hospice, said: “It was obvious when Jan first came to us that she is passionate about her animals and that horses have played a large part in her le for many years. The ethos of hospice care is not just about caring for the clinical needs of our patients but also looking after their emotional and spiritual needs as well. It’s about making a dference to our patients and their families in whatever way we can. “We know that sometimes people are scared at the thought of coming to the hospice, but it’s a positive place where people are supported and well cared for. The work of the hospice really does make a dference to people’s lives.“Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsHorsesAnimalsFriskTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was actually on my lunch break at work, so I shared the news straight away with all my colleagues!” Sarah is one of  million people who have received that exciting news telling them theyaposre a winner, since The Health Lottery launched  years ago, giving away £ million in prizes in that time. And the timing was perfect for the mother and grandmother from Oldham. Sarah turns  soon, and the £, windfall means she can really celebrate her half-century milestone in style. With partner Darren also reaching that golden birthday this year, Sarah plans to invest her winnings in a top-notch sunny holiday.The Health Lottery turns  this month. In that time,  million players have netted £ million worth of prizes - and theyaposre not the only winners. The Health Lottery is committed to supporting communities that need it most, and so far £ million has been raised for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health.

My partner and I both turn the big - this year, and we’re treating ourselves with a holiday of a letime to Mexico. We will certainly be enjoying a margarita or two on The Health Lottery.” And itaposs not just the winners that benefit, as money raised through The Health Lottery helps fund vital local community projects. £ million has been raised so far, for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health.This is one of the reasons Sarah plays The Health Lottery online. “I have been playing The Health Lottery once a week since , picking two lines,” she explains.My nan had Alzheimer’s, so it is really important for me to support these projects. They are empowering the most vulnerable communities and tackling health inequalities around Great Britain. It is fantastic that I can give back a little to these wonderful projects by simply buying a ticket.” I asked my we to check all the numbers! For Nuneaton Rugby Club player, Allan Taylor, finding out heaposd scooped £, in last yearaposs New Year’s Day draw was a great way to kick of .  “You never think it is going to be you,” said father-of-three Allan, . “I couldn’t believe it was true! I asked my we and girls to all check my numbers. We wanted to make sure it was the real deal before we could properly celebrate! They were ecstatic about the news. It has allowed us to get that long weekend in Dublin that we have always wanted. I really fancy going on the Guinness factory tour and learning a little more about my favourite stout.” One of the reasons Allan plays is because it allows him to give something back. Playing The Health Lottery supports so many great causes. We are a family that has received some great support over the years from local causes. It is wonderful that we can give back to these grassroots projects simply by buying a Health Lottery ticket.” The size of the prize hasnapost sunk in yet! When Sue from Chesterfield got a phone call from The Health Lottery asking her to check her online Health Lottery account - something Sue hadn’t done in a while - what she saw changed her le. She had won £, in a second chance draw. “To be honest, I’ve been thinking about what I need,” said Sue, when asked what sheaposll spend the money on. I barely spend money on myself normally so this is a chance to fix up some things that need done. The garden. The house. Things like that. The size of the prize hasn’t sunk in yet so who knows what will be left. Maybe enough for a car  A holiday  It’s exciting to think about.” The former community worker says that playing The Health Lottery is a continuation of her work to support others. She said: “I’ve always been keen on helping people. I’ve been brought up that way. So I’d happily spend £ on a Health Lottery ticket because I know that it genuinely helps people. I’ve seen some of the good causes that are supported. Obviously I play the lottery for the prizes, as we all do, but the sense of supporting your community really sweetens the win.” It’s been a great moment to share In August , the News UK finance team syndicate scooped a fantastic £, after matching  balls, plus the bonus ball. Formed of eight players, the Peterborough-based team have been playing The Health Lottery for three years now – and were delighted to bag their first big win.  Syndicate leader Gary Smithdale said: “When I answered the call, the news came as a great surprise – I couldn’t wait to tell everyone! Some of us have worked together for over  years, so it’s been a great moment to share.” Their big win even inspired a new team name. “What about Sunshine  ” mused team member Margaret Lenton. “The sun’s shining on this lucky day, and there’s eight of us!”It is very important to support the local charities that benefit from Health Lottery salesKathy Brown, a Buckinghamshire Council Business Support Officer from Aylesbury, was delighted when she found out she had won £, in The Health Lottery’s draw online. Amazingly, this is the second time she has won a tidy sum by playing The Health Lottery, although her recent winnings dwarf the £ won previously. Big hearted Kathy says a big reason she plays is to support local causes and community projects: “In this day and age I think it is very important to support The Health Lottery and all the charities that are supported.”  While she plans on enjoying spending much of her winnings herself, she said she will make sure her daughters benefit too, selflessly spreading the joy to her family.

There had been suggestions the couple wouldto Britain to have their four-month-old baptised at Windsor Castle like their son Archie, two. Lilibet Diana, affectionately known as Lili and who is named after the Queen and after Harryaposs mum Diana, was born in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calornia in June.But a palace insider told the: “There will not be a christening in the UK. It is not happening.Another source said it would be “highly unlikely”.  Instead, Lilibet is likely to be christened into the Episcopal Church of the US, a member church of the worldwide Anglican Communion. If baptised in Calornia, she would not automatically be considered a member of the Church of England, unless she came to Britain and joined a CofE congregation. Anyone can say they are a member of the Church of Englandthey worship in a CofE church and are not a member of an incompatible religion.A member of the Royal Family does not need to be baptised to remain in the line of succession. In , Meghan Markle was baptised and confirmed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a secret service at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace.Holy water from the River Jordan from the private Royal Family font was poured on Meghanaposs head in the ceremony and The Chapel Royal choir of six Gentlemen-in-Ordinary and ten Children of the Chapel performed throughout the service, it was claimed.  The Sussexes stirred controversy with their first child Archieaposs christening as they kept the ceremony private.In August, royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliamstold Express:Harry and Meghan’s relations with the British press went badly downhill when Archie was christened in private and the names of the godparents were not released.”He continued: It must be likely that she will be christened in Calornia though there were rumours of a possible christening at Windsor.” Mr Fitzwilliams said: It seems certain that her christening will be in Meghan’s home state and with the secrecy but without the controversy that surrounded Archie’s christening. It comes after a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed the couple will not be flying back to the UK for a party in honour of Princess Diana.  Around  people are expected to attend the bash at Kensington Palace on October , with Diana’s old friend Sir Elton John said to be on the guest list. The celebration has been organised to thank donors for funding a commemorative statue of Diana which now sits in Kensington Palace’s Sunken Garden. It was previously reported that royal aides were preparing for Meghan and Harry to make a surprisefor the bash. Harry has ed to the UK on only two occasions since moving to the US, namely for his granddadaposs Philipaposs funeral and for the unveiling of Dianaaposs statue on what wouldaposve been her th birthday. Meghan stayed at home on both occasions, mainly on medical grounds as she was heavily pregnant when the funeral took place in April.

Charlie Naughton, , was in a pub with family and friends when he jumped up to celebrate the strike on June  before suddenly falling down and hitting his head.The devoted Cha fan, described by a coroner as fit and well, died around an hour later at the hospital. A pathologist was unable to find a cause of death and a coroner recorded an open conclusion. A post-mortem found Charlie was only just over the drink-drive limit and there was no evidence he had taken drugs, West London Coroneraposs Court heard.  In a statement, the family paid tribute to the happy-go-lucky and loyal bricklayer who adored his family and Cha FC. His mum Karen Sayer said: Cha was his true love. He travelled land and sea to support and watch them. He took regular bike rides and would walk his beloved dog Mush. He was a hard-working man - working every day on ious sites and doing private work as he was a fully qualied bricklayer. Charlie loved his family dearly. Charlie enjoyed time with his mates, most of whom he had gone to nursery with. He was with his best mates when he passed. He enjoyed many holidays together, sometimes twice a year together as a family. He was the most loyal and respectful person you would meet. He was always concerned about other people, especially his sisters and mum.  She said over , people attended his funeral as Charlie had many friends. She added: Charlieaposs passing has had a massive effect on many many people. Never did we expect to walk out of his front door one morning to never come back. Absolute heartbreak and devastation all in the blink of an eye. He had his whole le and a million dreams in front of him. He was my first ever best friend, my everything. The inquest heard Charlie was at a pub in Uxbridge, west London, watching the game with friends and his dad, and had drunk around six pints of lager. An ambulance was called at .pm and paramedics found he had an irregular heartbeat.  Despite resuscitation attempts, Charlie was pronounced dead around an hour later at Hillingdon Hospital AE. It was said the only injuries found on Charlie were a bruise on his head and a bitten tongue, the inquest heard. The post-mortem did not find any evidence he had a heart attack and there were no findings of heart or lung disease. Pathologist Dr Hiam Ali said Charlie died of sudden adult death. Mrs Sayer told the inquest her son had been wrongfully described as a regular cocaine user in documents sent to the coroner. She said: It states Charlie was a regular cocaine user - thataposs not the case. He was in no way a regular user, that word to me shouldnapost be there. Coroner Lydia Brown said: There was no evidence of recent cocaine use. It wasnapost found in the toxicology. She added: Iaposm afraid when you analyse sudden adult death that it doesnapost explain anything at all. Itaposs used when you canapost find a reason why Charlie is not with us. Recording an open conclusion, the coroner said: Charlie was watching a game of football in a public house on the  June  when he collapsed. There were no signicant injuries sustained. Paramedics resuscitated him at the scene and conveyed him to Hillingdon Hospital by ambulance where continued resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. I will be recording what is known as an open conclusion - it means the evidence does not reach the test Iaposm obliged to use. We have exhausted all lines of enquiry.

He was jailed in  following a DNA breakthroughJohn McGlynn is back on the streetsByTom Pettor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct A rapist linked by a former det­ective to crimes by the Night Stalker is now back on the streets after  years in jail. John McGlynn was convicted of rape, another serious sexual offence, burglary and  imprisonment over the  attack on an -year-old widow. McGlynn, now , was one of two men who had subjected victim “Rose” to a four-hour ordeal. He was jailed in  following a DNA breakthrough. His finger and palm marks also matched those left at Rose’s home. Sources now say that McGlynn, of Darlington, Co Durham, was released last year under licence, two-thirds into his -year term.  Rose, who died before McGlynn was caught, told police two men had broken into her home in Beckenham, in the heart of the Night Stalker’s hunting ground in South East London. And former detective Colin Sutton, upon whose career ITV drama Manhunt is based, believes Night Stalker Delroy Grant – who he helped catch in  after a -year reign of terror – may be the second man. Rose told police that one attacker was black, shone a torch in her eyes, soothed her and gave her water — as Grant often did with his victims.  Grant and McGlynn were both sexually attracted to elderly women and had once lived in Leicester at the same time. Mr Sutton, who is played by Martin Clunes in the TV hit, makes his claims about the pair in his book Operation Minstead, which was the basis for the second series of Manhunt screened last month.In it, he writes: “I think there is a sequence of events that would fitwith the evidence and explain the surprising inconsistencies in this shocking case...“Delroy Grant and John McGlynn knew each other in the mid-s and discovered they had a shared attraction to elderly ladies.” Mr Sutton also said the “striking similarities with Grant’s modus operandi were utterly convincing”. And he fears the pair could be behind more crimes on top of the  already linked to Grant, who is currently serving four le terms for  offences.

The Prince of Wales talked about his unusual car in a new wide-ranging interview with the BBC, where he chats about the environment and climate change.During the interview, Charles was asked about his own carbon footprint as well as his love of cars. Interviewer Justin Rowlatt said: Is it fair to say you are a bit of a Clarkson, a bit of a kind of petrol head, and youaposve always enjoyed cars  Charles replied: Yes, but that was before we knew what the problems were.  But my old Aston Martin, which Iaposve had for  years Iaposve managed to covert. I hardly have a chance to drive it now but that now runs on waste products, can you believe this, surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process. As well as converting his car, Charles also revealed some of the steps he has taken to reduce his carbon footprint. These included cutting out meat and fish from his diet two days a week and cutting dairy one day a week, installing solar  on Clarence House and at Highgrove and using biomass boilers that use wood chippings to heat his Birkhall estate.

Meanwhile, he also revealed the sweet tribute he has created in honour of his grandson Prince George on the Balmoral estate. During the interview, Charles is seen wandering around a garden he planted at Birkhall that he has called Prince Georgeaposs Wood. Explaining the signicance of the garden, Charles said: This was a rather empty field that the farm didnapost need anymore. The great thing was, I managed to plant it the same year that my grandson was born, the eldest, George. So, I thought Iaposd call it Prince Georgeaposs Wood. I just hope he appreciates it one day.The interview comes after it was revealed that Charles will attend the COP climate change summit in Glasgow next month.Other senior royals who will also attend are the Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.The Big Interviews: Prince Charles and His Battle For Our Planet is available on BBC iPlayer.Comment MORE ON Prince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilyClimate change\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Whether it be in supermarkets, for the tube or just to get a coffee, we all instinctually follow the leader and plonk ourselves behind the person at the back to politely wait our turn.Recently drivers queued for hours to for fuel as a delivery crisis gripped the nation. But how much better would it beyou could just get someone  to do it for you  Fear not, the website TaskRabbit offers the option to employ people to queue for you, for just the low low price of £. an hour.  It lists a number of roles that their ‘elite taskers’ can participate in with a collection of pro-queuers having their profile promoted on the site. The rates for these queuers y from the low ball figure of £. an hour to an eye watering £.. With the very specic pricing, it can be assumed that part of the reason for the seemingly extortionate rates is a commission taken by the site itself. Greg S, who is charging the premium price for his services, said: “I’ve queued for theatre tickets and shop launches from very unsociable hours!” With the increasing number of product drops by popular fashion brands, which limit the amount of time and quantity that items are sold in, and long lines to get the latest iPhone on day of release, paying someone to queue may only grow in scope, especially with the reintroduction of in-person shopping. One person listed on the website has been hired  times to queue at £. an hour. Most people that list queuing as something they can be hired for are not solely available as queuers, offering all sorts of services from pet sitting to baking. As the gig economy expands and some Londoners willing to pay for convenience, this might be a trend that continues to grow - and at £ an hour who wouldn’t be motivated to participate in Britain’s supposed favourite pastime.

The angry reaction began with one parent on a visit to Sainsburyaposs coming across the problematic clothing and made a post titled nothing is going to change for women while girls are still targeted by this b******t.

The reaction online was one of exasperation and frustration from mums all too used to the problem. Ugh. Itaposs not even insidious, pretty obvious and evident, one groaned. I agree the messaging is really terrible, as are the clothes themselves but anyway. Conditioning does start from pretty much the womb.  The original poster also added a follow-up post saying: I honestly canapost believe that no one in the meeting where this seasonaposs collection was signed off flagged up that this might need looking at again. Who designs these things  Who approves them  Iaposd actually really like to know. My kids are in their late teens and twenties now and Iaposm shocked by how much more polarised the messaging has become since I was buying this stuff. There was always a bit of a kittens and sharks ide, but not such extreme dferences in messages. It feels like grooming. Another shopper shared their recent experience in another big store. Iaposve just been in Primark this morning and all hoodies in my daughteraposs size were aposbe niceapos aposalways be kindapos etc which are such f*****g dangerous messages to send little girls, they said. In my sonaposs size he had dinosaurs, aposIaposm roarsomeapos aposT-Rex expertapos. Iaposm so tired of it. Another questioned: Why is the onus on girls to be compliant, forgiving, and agreeable  Some parents made the point that the responsibility for messages like these doesnapost just lie with the producers but also the consumer. Change only happenseverybody takes responsibility. This includes big businesses, retailers, manufacturers as well as parents, and schools, a parent said. Everyone has a stake in making a better future free of damaging stereotypes. The letaposs stay home t-shirt is filtered using the girls section on Sainsburyaposs website, and the unlimited hoody by the boys section.

After buying her home, she decided to share some tips for other young people who are planning to stop renting and purchase a house too. Sujaana works as a part-time tutor teaching science and maths to young students, which helps her pocket some extra money. The student also started her online skincare business on Etsy selling herbal face masks and toners. The budding entrepreneur makes the products at home using all-natural ingredients, including turmeric, which is widely known for its health benefits. The student worked up to  hours five days a week, using the extra income towards her house deposit.  She said: My parents were a big support for my business and always motivated me since I was a child. They never said my dreams were too big when others said it was unrealistic. However, Sujaana said students do not need to work part-time to save up money for a house. Sujaana, who lives at home with her parents, used the bulk of her student maintenance loan towards her deposit. She said: I stayed at home and saved up the maintenance money I got. If you save up two years of your maintenance money, you would have enough for a whole house deposit. You can buy a house with just maintenance money and you donapost have to work full-time. I also saved my tuition money and my side Etsy business. There are a lot of things you can do from home to make money, and tutoring is a really easy thing to do as a student. It doesnapost cost a lot to set up and there is a demand for private tutors. Sometimes people get scared of starting their own business and they think they need a lot of money to do it, but that isnapost the case.  Sujaana always had a passion for real estate and set a goal of buying her first house by the age of . She was inspired by her late uncle, Alexander Lawrence, a successful businessman in Sri Lanka, who taught her the ropes when it came to investing. She said: I always wanted to get into real estate since I was young, I was inspired by my uncle. He started businesses in Sri Lanka at a young age with just a bicycle to get around. He became really big in the region, and I always wanted to become like him. I had the goal to buy a house at the age of  no matter what. I did whatever I could and thought of dferent ways to achieve it, and I did. Sujaana advised students to take full advantage of discounts available to them, such as Uni Days and Student Beans. She also stays away from buying groceries at major supermarkets and instead, shops at local mini-marts for a fraction of the cost. She explained: University students think itaposs impossible to buy your home. But this is the time in your le where it is possible to gain income and buy a home early. There are so many student discounts that students donapost use such as Student Beans and Uni Days. People donapost tend to use them because they canapost be bothered to look for the discount codes, you save so much on clothes and shoes - and get freebies sometimes. Try and cook yourself rather than buying takeouts. Also, I tend to shop in markets for groceries because they are so much cheaper than big supermarkets like Asda.

Frantisek Frankie Morris, , from Llandegfan, Anglesey, in Wales, disappeared after going to a rave and his body was found after a month long search.Senior coroner Katie Sutherland confirmed at an inquest in Caernarfon that the rape allegation may have troubled his mind, reported NorthWalesLive.Det Inspec Lee Boycott told the hearing the allegation was made around eight months prior to his death and that no further action had been taken with Mr Morris at the time and he was never spoken to by police officers. But the rape allegation is believe to have been mentioned to Mr Morris at the rave, held in a disused quarry near Waunfawr, Gwynedd on May .  He was last seen pushing his bike at Pentir the following day and his body was finally found by officers on Thursday, June , in dense woodland near Caerhun on the outskirts of Bangor. DI Boycott said some weeks before the rave there had been a chance meeting between Mr Morris and his accuser and they were seen to shake hands and he believed any bad feeling had subsided. He added: The accusation was eight to nine months prior but people had mentioned the alleged rape to Frankie during the rave. A statement was read out by Frankieaposs mother, Alice Morris, during the inquest in which she described him as being generous, sincere and honest with a good sense of humour. At the hearing his father, James Morris said his son was a lovely young person with a good heart.  His brother, Robin Morris, confirmed in his statement that Frankie had told him that he felt suicidal around a month before he disappeared. He said: Frankie was not known for being the most socially confident but he had a lot of friends. He was a happy person. He had been working with me and had a positive mindset. I knew he took drugs but not what I would class as hard drugs. One day he told me he felt suicidal, like he was not getting anywhere in le, but to me, he seemed okay and not depressed. Dr Brian Rogers, who carried out the postmortem, confirmed there was no evidence that Mr Morris had been assaulted prior to his death or was killed.  Toxicological reports also showed that Mr Morris had taken cocaine at some point prior to his death with witness reports stating he had also been seen taking the drug ketamine at the rave. Concluding that he had intended to take his own le, the coroner Mrs Sutherland said: Frantisek Morris had been to a rave in Waunfawr where he had been taking illicit drugs. A conversation took place involving Frankie regarding a potential rape where no action was taken against him. It is not known exactly when he died but he had been missing for one month prior to being found. He had taken cocaine at some point and ketamine is reported as having been taken. There is no evidence that he had been to see his GP regarding his low mood but he had suicidal ideation around a month prior, saying that he felt his le was not going anywhere. There is evidence surrounding a rape allegation and conversations at the rave, no further police action was taken but this may have troubled his mind. I am satisfied that Frankie intended death to be the consequence of his actions. If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Erica Hampton, , has human faeces washing up into her garden, which she says smells like a third world country. Her family claim they have been unable to open their windows for months due to the stench which is caused by next doors toilet flushing into their garden. Despite many attempts to fix the problem which begun in July, water firm Severn Trent have been unable to resolve the leak, Mrs Hampton said. She says the situation has wreaked havoc on her le, along with her husband and -year-old son.  She said: “The smell is asyou are in a third world country. When next door flush their toilet it comes into my garden. You are smelling fresh faeces. “Me and my husband are disabled and I’ve got my -year-old son and my dogs – my little Jack Russell got in the water one time and I had to bathe her and take her to the vets to checkshe was okay. “We have wasted so much money on the back garden. We did it up with gravel and everything. We’ve had to take all that off because it’s soaked in wastewater, it stinks. We’ve lost a lot of money through it.” She added: “It’s so depressing. We can’t open the windows or the doors because of the smell. We can’t let the dogs out the back.

A Severn Trent spokesman said: “We’re sorry to hear about the issues Ms Hampton has been experiencing. “We are currently investigating the cause of the problems, with teams most recently visiting the site last Friday.

Symptoms have been described as being similar to Covid, so how can you tell one from the other Hundreds of thousands of people have been wiped out by a cold that is reportedly worse than Covid at times Image: Getty Images Tetra images RFByClaire Gilbody-DickersonNews reporter:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsMany Brits have been struck down by what has been branded as the worst cold ever - but what are the symptoms and how do you know itaposs not Covid  There isnapost exact data on the number of people who have caught the devastating bug in the past few weeks, as most people donapost report to their GP with a cold.But there is sufficient anecdotal evidence proving the lurgy has spread widely up and down the country.Rather than the usual runny nose and cough, the disease appears to be laying people out. Some people told the Mirror how the cold had been more debilitating than Covid, while others reported having to call sick for weeks because of it. One reported being so badly hit by the bug they had to call sick on the first day of their new job.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments below The spread of whataposs been branded the UKaposs worst lurgy has been attributed to a dip in immunity after a year and a half of social distancing and wearing face masks.Symptoms are very similar to the signs of Covid in a person who has been double-jabbed, raising fears the virus could be dismissed as a cold. So where does this super cold come from and how can you tell itaposs not Covid  Key dferences between cold and Covid symptomsAccording to Professor Azeem Majeed, we are seeing an increase in colds and other respiratory infections across the UK compared to the previous winter, when rates were very low because of social distancing and other infection control measures to tackle Covid.He said the symptoms of a cold typically include a blocked or runny nose, sore throat, headache, cough and sneezing, many of which can also occur in people with Covid-.Now that most adults in the UK have been fully vaccinated, when people do contract Covid-, it is often with milder symptoms that can overlap those from a cold, he told the Mirror. This means that for many people with these kinds of symptoms, a Covid- test will be needed to separate the two conditions. There will be a lot of scope for the public to confuse the symptoms of colds and Covid- during the winter. The message for the public should be to always be cautiousthey have symptoms of a cold, get a test when appropriate, and limit interactions with people outside your household until you are better. NHS guidance says you should treat a cold with:rest and sleep keep warm drink plenty of waterto avoid dehydration gargle salt water to soothe a sore throat You should see a GP :your symptoms do not improve after  weeks your symptoms get suddenly worse your temperature is very high or you feel hot and shivery youaposre concerned about your childaposs symptoms youaposre feeling short of breath or develop chest pain you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes, or a heart, lung or kidney condition you have a weakened immune system – for example, because youaposre having chemotherapy You can avoid catching a cold by washing your hands regularly with warm water and soap, not sharing towels or other household items with someone who has a cold, staying fit and healthy, and avoiding touching your face. The NHS lists the following symptoms as the three big signs of Covid - a high temperature which leaves your back or chest feeling hot, a new, continuous cough, and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But according to Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid study app, the guidance is not up-to-date. The UK still has more cases than most of Europe and I believe this is for two main reasons the first is a lack of masks and social distancing and the second is because we’re ignorant of the symptoms, he told The Mirror. We should be looking out for things like sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. The classic three - cough, fever and anosmia are rarer these days, yet the government has done nothing. By not updating advice, we’re letting people into care homes, schools, workplaces and large gatherings displaying known signs of Covid. Roughly,  in  people in the UK have Covid. If we don’t wake up to the fact these cold-like symptoms could be Covid, we will continue to keep numbers high, putting unnecessary strain on an exhausted NHS. Where does the UKaposs worst cold come from  The spike in viral infections come as the public s to normality -with less stress now on mask wearing and social distancing as Brits head back to work or school.New arrivals at universities also face a spike in Fresheraposs Flu - an increase in viral symptoms as students bring viruses from their own towns to their lecture halls, Wales Online reports.Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth told the BBC she caught a cold at a festival and it was aposthe worst everapos. She said: I barely slept, Iaposd wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired. The cold lasted more than a week, she said. Noor Hashmi, , another student, told the BBC: Normally Iaposm still able to go about my day, but this one left me with muscle fatigue, a lost voice and headache that meant Iaposve just stayed indoors. Dr Philippa advises people experiencing symptoms of Covid - like a new cough, fever, loss of sense of taste or smell - to take a PCR test.Cold symptoms can be treated with rest, fluids and over-the-counter painkillers, she adds. Following Covid prevention measures - like wearing masks and social distancing - means weaposve missed the chance to develop immunity to coughs, cold and flu viruses for two years. As your body has not had the opportunity to fight the illnesses, when they reach you the symptoms can be worse. Should you get a PCR test  The NHS advises people to testthey have any of the Covid symptoms it lists. Experts from Zoe Covid App recommend getting a Covid testyou have common symptoms of Covid, with this being particularly importantyou experience a loss of smell or taste. This is echoed by Cardf Universityaposs Professor Ron Eccles, who told the Mirror you cannot separate colds from Covid in jabbed people.

Marshals are having to supervise long queues amid an explosion in violence from boozers, who cabbies say are more drunk and aggressive than ever as theyto pubs and clubs after lockdown. The shortage comes after many drivers who lost fares during the pandemic switched to delivery work instead and are reluctant to . Cerys Edwards, , night sht manager for Coxon’s Cars in Grimsby, Lincs, said: “We‘ve had cars vandalised, I’ve had my window spat at, punched on. “I’ve been called all the names under the sun just because we’re telling them how long the wait is going to be.  “We’ve got a lot of this since the shortage of drivers. And people are drinking harder. It’s like the zombie apocalypse –they’re not staggering everywhere, they’re angry and violent.” Dee Grant, , a director at C Cabs in Blackpool since , said the violence is the worst she has ever known it. She added: “People are fighting and kicking cars. Nights are the worst. The council put marshals on but passengers are still throwing things at taxis, frustrated they can’t get in. One of our drivers got punched through his window.”  She said many night drivers got new jobs, adding: “They’d rather work for Amazon or DPD, where they meet people smiling at the door, instead of being punched.” Cllr Jonathan Dulston of Darlington Borough Council in Co Durham said: “It has become a bit of an issue as people are ing to the town on a Friday and Saturday night. We are seeing extreme frustration from people at am and am stuck in a taxi queue for upwards of an hour.” Some firms are offering cash incentives for night-time drivers, with one in Blackpool promising: “Get a £ transfer fee when you switch.” Dave Lawrie of The National Private Hire  Taxi Association blamed lack of Government support during lockdown. He said: “They found other jobs and haven’t come back.” He added: “The level of abuse against drivers has gone up astronomically. It’s a nightmare.” Uber is on a hiring spree as demand increases.

One person pointed out: “That dog asks, ‘Where you going ’” While another agreed, adding: “He said ... where are you going ” And someone  had the same idea, as they said: “I swear the dog said ‘Where you going ’” But other people heard slightly dferent words in the dog’s noise, and took to the comments to share what they thought the Malamute had said.  One wrote: “He sounds like he’s saying very nice.” And another insisted: “I heard, ‘What are you wearing ’” While a third posted: “He sounded like he said, ‘well hello’. I don’t knowsomeone  said that in the comments, but I just had to.” And some people in the video’s , comments just wanted to share alternative funny sentiments about what the dog might’ve been thinking at the time.

Dr Anna Popova warned of the threat posed by the Black Death, claiming itswas a “risk” to public health because of global warming. “We do see that the borders of plague hotspots have been changing with global warming and climate change, and other anthropogenic effects on the environment.,” she said. “We are aware that cases of plague in the world have been growing. “This is one of the risks on todayaposs agenda.” A rapid response to outbreaks in fleas was essential to stop the spread to humans, said Dr Popova.  Up to  million people were killed by the plague - also known as the Black Death - in the th century, wiping out % of the population of Europe at the time. Russia and China have seen outbreaks in recent years, and so has the US. The United Nations Children’s Fund UNICEF warned in August about its resurgence in Africa.  A month earlier the discovery of bubonic plague led to the the cancellation of the Mongolian leg of the Silk Way Rally. The country has suffered a number of outbreaks in recent years. Russia last year took major steps to stop a spread of the Black Death across its frontiers with Mongolia and China. Tens of thousands of people were vaccinated in border areas in the Tuva and Altai republics of Siberia as the country simultaneously fought Covid-.  One outbreak was recorded on the Ukok plateau of the Altai Mountains in Russia - for the first time in more than  years. Bubonic plague is a bacterial d isease spread by fleas living on wild rodents and can kill an adult in less than  hoursnot treated in time.

Deaf and blind dogs experience the world dferently to other pets, but that doesn’t stop them from having fun - as two disabled dogs have proven.The TikTok account @ Echobadlistener documents what it’s like to live with four disabled dogs, each with their own inidual quirks and personalities.But the dogs, named Morty, Echo, Lucy and Frank, still love to try and play with each other, even though they can’t see or hear each other. In an adorable video viewed over , times, their owner showed their fans how some of the dogs try to communicate despite their dferences. The clip sees deaf and blind Morty encouraged to chase Lucy, who is deaf and visually impaired.  Lucy, who has some vision, boops Morty’s nose in a bid to get him to join in, as a confuse Morty tries to work out what the game actually is. The overlaying text read: “Come on, chase me!” as Lucy jumps into a play bow, with Morty edging forward to find her. It looks as though Morty thinks, plotting how to best enter the game, before pouncing forward onto an unsuspecting Lucy. The heart warming video earned hundreds of comments from viewers who adored seeing the duo play.It’s Dog Show week over at TeamDogs - a six-day celebration of what makes our pets special in the style of a virtual village fete without the muddy field and dodgy hotdogs. Every day we will reveal a dferent category that we’d love you to enter by simply sharing a photo or video of your gorgeous dog. Find out how to enter. One said: “Thank you for showing that they do play even though they are deaf and blind.” Another added: “I’m glad to see it’s not just my blind dog who’s still crazy.” Others were impressed with Morty’s skills, convinced he had a plan the whole time. “Morty knew all along, just patiently waiting and plotting,” a third added. Another said: “Morty being sneaky like this makes me smile every time.” Blind dogs can still live a full and happy le, even though they don’t always know what’s going on around them. A one-eyed deaf pitbull Wink also captured the hearts of TikTok viewers last month when he was caught cuddling his ‘emotional support chihuahua. The lovely video shows just how close the two dogs are, with Wink wrapping her legs around the lbs Nfler in a warm embrace while the cosy chihuahua rests its eyes. Other blind dogs simply don’t realise they might run into things, so owners have to adapt their surroundings to avoid injury.Fetch. Chase. Eat. Sleep.

The DPRK leader said: ”We are not discussing war with anyone, but rather to prevent war itself and to literally increase war deterrence for the protection of national sovereignty.” He added that the US is “creating regional tension with wrong decisions and action” and that he did not trust Washington’s claim that it has no hostile intent towards him, NK news reports.  US military activities such as joint exercises with South Korea are “bringing about many prospective dangers” and “raising the urgency to further strengthen ourselves”, he continued. He also promised to carry out military development plans including new solid-fuelled ICBMs, a new nuclear missile capable submarine and a military reconnaissance satellite – but claimed these were all in the name of self-defence. Describing South Korea’s attitude as “dualistic, illogical and gangster-like”, he went on to reject warn that he would “respond with strong action and not condone” the South’s intent to “harm” North Korea’s right to self-defence. His comments came amid increasingly heated tensions between North and South Korea, less than a month after both sides test-fired ballistic missiles in the latest volley of the arms race. South Korea recently tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, alongside plans to build major new weapons include aircraft carriers and the purchase of American-made F- stealth fighters. North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations claimed it has the right to self defence and to test weapons given the “hostile policy’ by the US, after South Koreaaposs military said North Korea had fired an unidentied projectile towards the sea off its east coast. In an address to the annual United Nations General Assembly, Kim Song said: “Nobody can deny the righteous right to self-defense for the DPRK to develop, test, manufacture, and possess the weapon systems, equivalent to the ones which are possessed or being developed by them.”  The US has said it would be willing to hold diplomatic talks at any time with North Korea. On Tuesday, South Koreaaposs national security advisor, Suh Hoon, is expected to meet with his American counterpart Jake Sullivan to discuss the subject of North Korea. Speaking to reporters in Washington on Monday, Mr Suh said he planned to discuss President Moon Jae-inaposs proposal for a formal declaration ending the - Korean War and for possible easing of sanctions on North Korea, Yonhap news agency reported.

The Sunnybank player wrapped his foot around the ball and fired a sublime effort into the top corner.Skipper Dom Rae added number three with a cool finish, before Cumming, who is on loan from Elgin City, managed to recover from a poor first touch to shoot home for his second of the afternoon.Defensive midfielder Eddie Fuller made it five, heading home a Still cross for his first of the campaign, before Scott Burnett’s cross found fellow substitute Kevin Robertson, who flicked the ball home to complete the scoring.Sunnybank boss Paul Leahy was delighted to pick up back-to-back league wins following a disappointing September, saying: “It was a tough first half and quite a close contest, but once we got the second goal, it made us relax a bit more and we played some good football.“Dean’s coming into a bit of form just now, as is Dylan, who’s been a great addition to the squad this season with great energy on the wing.#Dom, our captain, has been very reliable, even when we went though kind of a bad patch, leading by example.#Kevin’s just back from injury, so it was good to get him some game time.”Leahy confirmed the top priority for the season remains clinching ato the Superleague, adding: “That was our ambition at the start and we got off to a strong start, then we had a dip when were suffering a number of injuries and suspensions. But now we’re back to a full squad and just taking it game by game, although the next two league games are against the teams above us.”Before their next league match, Sunnybank are facing a trip to top-flight Hermes on Saturday in the League Cup.Leahy said: “A draw or a win would put us through to the knockout stages. It’ll be a good test for the lads also to see how they get on against a Superleague team.”With keeper Keller Emslie recalled by Culter, Bank have signed Huntly goalie Keith Robertshaw on a month-long loan to help out, with Leahy keen to extend the deal beyond thatat all possible.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

However, I do know that there were a lot of concerns locally about its effect on existing accommodation providers. Of course, the pandemic has also vastly altered many companiesrsquo plans for expansion.ldquoIt is good news that Lidl have said they will create  jobs at the Borders Gateway development by opening a store there.Christine Grahame - SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and LauderdaleldquoWhen these plans were first announced in , I was really pleased to see Premier Inn considering opening in the Borders but I had real concerns about the choice of site. I raised this with Premier Inn and the council at the time, as I felt that siting the hotel at what is in effect an out of town retail park at Tweedbank would not support local businesses and, given the proposed provision of a coffee shop and food store at the development as well, would only serve to further dissuade guests from making the trip into Galashiels town centre.ldquoThe pandemic has brought into even sharper relief the need to support our town centre and, particularly with the opening of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, I sincerely hope Premier Inn will take forward plans in the Borders and I am pleased they are now looking for a site in Galashiels as a more viable option rather than withdrawing completely.Sandy Aitchison - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoObviously the decision of Premier Inn to pull out of the Tweedbank hotel project is a disappointment. I think a large part of that type of hotel grouprsquos business is from the mobility of the workforce and the uncertainty of the future changes to that mobility has affected their decision. That is a decision for their management to take based on their projections.ldquoPersonally I think they may have missed a trick as more and more people are discovering that the Borders is on a pathway to recovery in so many ways. The councilrsquos ambition for the future with the City Deal, Borderlands and levelling up finance coming into the Borders, is a strong weapon to ensure that our future is bright. The Borders is a great place to live, work, play and visit. More people are now seeing that fact. This means a bright future for everybody, including hoteliers.Harry Scott - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoI was very disappointed to hear that Premier Inn had withdrawn from the Tweedbank site after what appeared to be a very promising beginning. Not only would it have created jobs on site, but could have offered career progression to our young people and others through other disciplines and specialisms which a large company like Whitbread can offer.ldquoI have read that, like many companies in the hospitality sector, Whitbread has suffered quite badly financially because of COVID-, but with better times ahead, hopefully, the company may reassess the proposition and establish a presence somewhere in the Galashiels area.Euan Jardine - Conservative councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt was disappointing to hear the news that Premier Inn had pulled out of Tweedbank as it was a great opportunity for the region. However, that site will now be home to five new industrial units instead of the hotel which will create up to  jobs. A Lidl supermarket has also been confirmed in the same development.ldquoI am also very encouraged that Premier Inn have stated that they are still interested in coming to Galashiels, so we must continue to work with them in finding a suitable site. Galashiels and the Borders as a whole is evolving into a national and international tourist destination and we need the facilities to support that.Andy Anderson - SNP councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt is disappointing to see any large business walk away from a project in the Borders, especially when the original plans raised some controversy. However, as Premier Inns have expressed an interest in locating in Galashiels, this may not be a complete loss and could turn out to be Galashielsrsquo gain ndash something that the town has been crying out for. I hope that Premier Inn will engage with SBC, elected members and developers to explore these possibilities.ldquoI note that Manor Place Developments already have new proposals to make use of their site and are hoping to bring another major business to the central Borders alongside industrial units, which are possibly more appropriate to their site.David Parker - Independent councillor for Melrose and Leaderdale, and council convenerldquoDue to the pandemic, the current business climate has been dficult for everyone and Irsquom not surprised that Manor Place Developments have had to adjust their Tweedbank proposals in response to the economic climate. The new proposals will still represent a signicant investment in Tweedbank and the Scottish Borders and will bring jobs to the local area. Irsquom sure everyone will welcome the new investment and will look pragmatically at the new proposals in light of the current economic backdrop.Premier InnA spokesperson told us: ldquoThe contract we agreed with our development partner has now expired and having re-appraised the proposed -bedroom hotel in the current economic climate, it is currently unviable for [owner] Whitbread.

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

When they called me for a pre-programme chat, I was asked how my age affected my parenting. I was askedI had less energy as an older parent and got very tired. My response was that every parent, no matter the age, gets very tired!I agreed to do the show. Their intentions were good and I was treated very fairly, and I think the host was sympathetic and supportive. Irsquom not the oldest parent in the land, but I do concede that Irsquom older than most, at least in terms of my younger children, the youngest of whom is six.But the experience raised some interesting questions for me about how age is often used to define us and our abilities, and indeed how we can define ourselves by it.Thankfully, these days society is far more erse and also, I believe, less judgmental, of people who donrsquot conform to stereotyped roles. But the truth is, recently I have begun to feel the cold wind of ageism affecting how I see myself and my opportunities.This radio programme was just the most recent example of my age being regarded an issue. Of course, as we age we do change in our abilities, nobody could deny that. But that can be for the better as well. Being seen as older is relative to the context, I get that. As a dad of young children, I accept the label of older parent. But it was the assumptions about how my age must negatively affect my capabilities as a dad which hit me hard.I felt uncomfortable even acknowledging these feelings to myself. Then I realised that was part of the problem: that people who are older can feel they have no entitlement to speak out against the unfair judgements they feel are attached to their age. Societyrsquos message can be brutal: as people get older, they need to give way and quietly fade .Irsquom nearly , not very old really, but certainly getting on. This is not about denying my age. I would not want to pretend to be younger. I am who I am. Actually, Irsquom quite proud to have made it this far and hope to have a couple more productive decades, at least,my luck holds out.But I fear that so far Irsquove only had a taster of what is to come with assumptions about my age. It seems to begin in earnest when someone reaches their s.Finding work after the impact of the lockdowns is a massive challenge, and huge source of anxiety, for millions of people. Those who are older, I suspect, will find their age a source of subtle discrimination, regardless of their actual abilities and family responsibilities.And the key word here is lsquosubtlersquo. Few employers will say out loud that they think someone is too old for a job, eventhey have the abilities to do it well. There is anti-discriminatory legislation in place now to prevent that. So itrsquos unspoken and structural ndash the discrimination is so ingrained that most of us donrsquot see it or realise discrimination is taking place. Its most powerful effect is the internalisation of it by older people themselves, who donrsquot even apply for jobs they know they are fully qualied and able to do, because of the fear they will be seen as ldquotoo old.I myself have only come to understand this as I have grown older and experienced it personally. I was once young, of course, as all older people were, and I was as guilty as anyone  of judging older people because of their age when I had youth on my side. So I speak from no moral high ground and some may say itrsquos just the way of things.Thatrsquos the pernicious nature of this kind of discrimination: it can be seen as a sad but inevitable rite of passage part of the circle of le in which we will inevitably be marginalised by society in a host of dferent ways as we get older.But I donrsquot believe it need be this way, and part of changing it is talking honestly about it, and calling it out when it happens. Age is just one part of who we are. It doesnrsquot completely define us or our abilities, capabilities or suitability for a job or le responsibility. And let us not forget that age discrimination doesnrsquot only affect older folk. Young people, including teenagers, can suffer from it too from older people.There are cultures which revere the contribution and abilities of older people, rather than dismiss or diminish them letrsquos try and make our society one of them. I donrsquot say this for me, but for everyone out there who is experiencing that gradual push into the margins they feel they just have to accept, regardless of what they can actually do.Itrsquos about inter-generational respect and it has to go both ways to be effective. In a sense, we would all be winners with this change, as we all learn,we are lucky enough to become older, that time truly does fly."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraiser-raises-700-walk-scott-foundation","story":"Iain Donaldson-Elder, , a former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil, participated in this yearrsquos recent Walk with Scott.Walkers covered  miles across East Lothian and Iain joined at Haddington as they made their way to the town rugby club after following the Longniddry to Haddington railway walk.Accompanied by Jim Liddle, from Leuchie House, a respite centre near North Berwick for people with MS and other long-term conditions, Iain ldquorolled his wheelchair for about three miles and was delighted to receive a certicate as a Scotter of the Year from Councillor Colin McGinn.Iain told the Courier: ldquoThe walk itself was wonderful, emotional and, although short, very rewarding as I got to meet people that I had only known through Facebook.

Not only has it been able to get a committee together, it was also approached by Queens Park FC with an offer to work together.The club sits on what was the original Hampden Park which was home to the national side from  to  and also where Queens Park once played and can be credited as the birthplace of the modern passing game.However, the committee was standing down and they were looking for at least five members to step up and take on committee roles to move the club forward.Stepping up is Ian Lewis who takes over as president at a time when there is a hefty repair bill for a leaking roof with previous estimates suggesting it might need as much as pound, to complete repairs.Mr Lewis said: \"Ive been involved in the sport since  and have seen the days when there has been  year waiting lists just to get into bowling clubs. However, I have watched it get to the point where some clubs are close to tipping point.\"I gave it a lot of thought, as it is a big job, but I felt it was the right time to take it on and to move forward. We have got a bit of a momentum going just now and a committee has been voted in so we are a viable organisation. We now have to look at how the club survives.\"Along with running the club, also comes the added responsibility of the sites historic past. Had the club not been able to form a committee, the lease would have been terminated and it risked reverting back to owners City Property, an arms- council organisation.Mr Lewis added: \"I am confident that we can move forward and we have got lot of community support behind us as well. One of the first things we need to do is look at getting a structural engineers report and estimates for work required. The tarpaulin on the roof just now is not even on the original part of the building and that is quite delicate.\"Any work that is needed is very involved as we are so close to the railway line and that brings its own issues. With it being the close season just now, it allows us to use our time as best we can.\"It is only fairly recently that the connection was made with the first Hampden site and it does make us unique in the world of bowling that we have this link which we are very proud of.\"And within hours of The Heralds story on the fears for the future of the club appearing in Saturdays paper, interest was shown by bosses at nearby Queens Park and an approach was made.Mr Lewis added: \"All we can say at the moment is that Queens Park have been in contact and want to be part of the future of the club, its site and its history.

His claim that Ms Blackman published a ldquonon-apology apology is incorrect she did not give the impression of an apology, because she does not have anything to apologise for. She has made it clear she stands by her position.He has done what he has accused others of: he has put a target on Ms Blackman because she took a stand against transphobia, while he rails against \"the loss of womenrsquos sex-based rights\". As a woman I would add that trans peoplersquos rights are of no threat to mine. It might helpMr McKenna realised that we have been living with trans and non-binary communities for a very long time, and wersquove lost none of our rights, nor will we lose any future rights. If people such as Ms Cherry could stop for a moment, and think about the damage they perpetuate daily towards others, this world would be a kinder and more peaceful place. A basic level of respect for all human beings should not be up for debate. We should always love and accept people as they are.It is an embarrassment to see Scottish MPs pour gasoline on to the fire of transphobia and call it \"standing up for womenrsquos sex-based rights\".If we are incapable of extending the courtesy of humanity to people persecuted by a manufactured and cult-like obsession with genitalia, we have no chance at all of being a forward-thinking, free and independent country.We need more SNP MPs to take a stand against transphobia, not fewer. Our society as a whole should always be one that chooses love over hate, peace over combat, and compassion over suffering and cruelty.Ciara Doyle, South Ayrshire.WHY ARE WOMEN BEING SILENCED IrsquoD like to raise a cheer for both Joanna Blythmanrsquos article crime test for new students is only the start\", The Herald, October  and also Catriona Stewartrsquos ldquoIn Lammy Land you can grow a cervix but not a brain . At last some journalists are speaking the truth about the trans issue and the Scottish Governmentrsquos gender identication legislation. What is the SNP Government thinking with this legislation  Why are women being silenced over this  When the voters and in particular women realise what this will really mean for them there will be a mini explosion.As an ordinary womanplease protect our female-only spaces. I do not want biologically male people allowed free access to them. A lot of us think knowledge of facts and common sense have gone out of the window.Elizabeth Reid, Dunblane.WE ARE NOT GUILT-TRIPPINGJOANNA Blythmanrsquos criticism of the pre-matriculation modules at the University of St Andrews is inaccurate and misleading in several important respects.The modules at St Andrews are not new. They have been in place here for several years, were campaigned for by our students, and co-designed with them.In the current feverish rush to vent at anything that might appear vaguely woke, Ms Blythman and others have fixated on a single question which asks students to consideracknowledging any feelings of personal guilt for unconscious bias is a good or a bad thing.The answer to the question is, explicitly, that ldquono one should feel guilty for displaying unconscious bias, butguilt is felt, acknowledging it can be a useful starting point for tackling bias. That is a very dferent thing from Ms Blythmans assertion that St Andrews is ldquoguilt-tripping its students in the name of ersity.The voices raised in anger against these modules are almost exclusively middle-aged and white, their university years are decades behind them, and minor considerations like the truth appear not be getting in the way of a good rant about the ldquolatest craziness.Thankfully, students take a more mature and nuanced view. Only the unwise would think it a good idea to put , people from  countries into one square mile in north-east Fe and trust to luck that there would be a unorm understanding of community norms.Our students recognised this. That is why they campaigned for these modules on consent, ersity, and sustainability, and sought to make them discursive and challenging.On ldquoposh St Andrews, and Scottish students making up ldquojust % of the student body, we respectfully offer two facts for consideration: approximately % of our Scottish entrants each year have a background in care, come from a low-progression school, or live in an area of multiple deprivation.The number of Scottish students at St Andrews, or any Scottish university for that matter, is determined entirely by the Scottish Government, not the universities themselves. We are told precisely how many Scots we may admit each year, andwe exceed that number, we are fined. That is the price of a system which must be capped to enable free tuition. Scotlandrsquos universities are as representative of the population as the Government allows them to be.Niall Scott, Director of Communications, University of St Andrews.INDOCTRINATED TO THINK SCOTTISHI NOTE that David Bone and Bob MacDougallappear to agree on the signicance of the First Minister hinting that the SNP only had to wait passively for Scottish independence as the No voters will have died.The assumption that young people coming to voting age will vote Yes for independence in any future independence referendum seems at first sight to be typical SNP complacency. Many will accept without question the fickle and impetuous inexperience of youth as perhaps being behind this assumption.However, it should be remembered that the SNP is in charge of Scottish education. The saying attributed to St Ignatius Loyola, ldquogive me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man, seems to me something for unionists to keep in the back of their minds as indeed the rational older generation dies off.For example, the CfE document on Experiences and Outcomes People, Past Events and Societies for Social Studies, tells us that young people learn to develop an ldquo understanding of the history, heritage and culture of Scotland.I am certain that many people will agree that the import of the word \"heritage\" is in itself something which could be taken as not only emotive but in the new sensitivity of an SNP Government playing a waiting game, potentially inflammatory.Although there is rare reference to the UK in the guidance documentation I am left feeling that our young people are at risk of being indoctrinated at an early age in school to think predominantly Scottish rather than British. Perhaps the First Minister has well thought out her subterfuge to simply wait.Bill Brown, Milngavie.WESTMINSTER AT THE WHEELDOUGLAS Bone complains of \"the almost dystopian Scotland the SNP has created\" since it came to power and Bob MacDougall talks of \"the shambles made of our public services\" in Scotland. Both conveniently forget that Scotland has two governments, one based in Edinburgh, and one in Westminster. The Scottish Government has few levers of control while Westminster is responsible for the steering wheel, accelerator and brake.Oddly, both place the blame for our current predicament on the Scottish Government a bit like suggesting that the passenger who selects the radio programme is at fault when the driver crashes into the wall.John Jamieson, Ayr.INDY QUESTION IS SIMPLEIS Robert Frazerkidding, or does he really believe that ldquo tens of thousands of ordinary people\" are so disinterested in understanding what they would be voting for, or so lacking in intelligence to care, that they would be confused by having to answer such a simple question in an Indyref as ldquoShould Scotland remain in the UK  Yes or No\"  I doubt such people would even bother to vote at all, but perhaps they could be encouraged to lodge a protest votethere was to be a third option of ldquoDonrsquot care\" or ldquoToo dficult\".Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.Letters: Leave voters owe the rest of us an apology"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmStromness Primary School pupils will be cheering on their chef, Karen Bevan, from afar this week, as she competes in the UK-wide School Chef of the Year competition.

But he still said his military did not target South Korea.ldquoI say once again that South Korea isnrsquot the one that our military forces have to fight against, Mr Kim said. ldquoSurely, we arenrsquot strengthening our defence capability because of South Korea.

But North Korea also said itrsquos open to talks with South Koreaconditions are met.Some experts say North Korea is attempting to use South Korearsquos desire to improve ties to pressure it to convince the United States to relax punishing economic sanctions on the North and make other concessions.North Korea has long sought improved ties with the United States because it wants sanctions relief and a better security environment to focus on reviving its moribund economy. The high-stakes diplomacy between the countries fell apart in early  after the Americans rejected North Korearsquos calls for extensive sanctions relief infor partial disarmament steps.The United States has recently repeatedly offered talks with North Korea ldquoanywhere and at any time without preconditions. Mr Kim has called such an offer ldquocunning attempt to conceal US hostility against North Korea, as he wants Washington to ease the sanctions or suspend its regular military drills with Seoul first before the talks can resume.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4142135.jpg--.jpg?1633698699000\n","title":"portglenone firm launch innovative new coffin pod","story":"A Portglenone hearse building firm has credited the support received from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in helping secure funding to launch an innovative ‘Coffin Pod’ which will help protect grieving families and funeral directors as the COVID- pandemic continues.Family-owned Quinn Hearse  Limousines have specialised in the design and manufacture of hearses and limousines for over a quarter of a century, and currently employ  staff.The company’s revolutionary new product has been launched following extensive market research after Quinn’s were awarded the Innovate NI Gold Standard accreditation.The Coffin Pod is a sealed glass pod which will allow funeral directors to transport coffins safely, and allow families to have open coffin wakes while observing social distancing measures.The development of the new product has been made possible with the support of a network of stakeholders, including the council’s Economic Development team, Innovate UK and Invest NI.Patrick Quinn, Company Director, said: “Innovation and new product development have been core to the business’s continued success. We had the idea to develop the Coffin Pod, after seeing the impact that Covid- was having on families being unable to properly mourn for their loved ones and to protect funeral directors in transport to their final resting place. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have supported us through the process of applying for the Innovate UK Challenge Fund to address the current and future impacts of Covid-. With their support, we successfully secured the funding to develop our Coffin Pod.“We are delighted to have now launched this into the market, and to have been awarded the Innovate NI Gold standard for this product. We continue to develop our core product ranges of hearses and limousines and have several new vehicles under development.”Speaking about the ongoing support received by the council, Patrick added:“Through our interaction with Council’s Business Client Manager, Barbara Orr we have received support through the Business Escalator and Business Escalator Plus Programmes to develop our export markets and growth development. The support through the programmes and assistance from Barbara has been truly worthwhile and I would recommend that businesses in our borough take advantage of the help available.“As we continue to move forward, we aim to make use of the assistance in the many dferent areas of running our business, to grow and create more jobs for the people of Ballymena.”Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, said: “Quinn Hearse  Limousine is just one of many companies across Mid and East Antrim to have benefitted from support via Council’s Amply programmes, since the launch of our economic development strategy in .“As well as supporting our SMEs to navigate through the current challenges posed by COVID-, we are preparing for the new economic landscape as we navigate post lockdown, and have provided expert guidance to support Quinn Hearse  Limousine with its longer-term business development strategy.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Business Escalator and Escalator Plus Programmes are part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.To find out more make an enquiry today via midandeastantrim.gov.uk EscalatorPlus "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633709144535.jpg--covid_19___fri_8th_october_figures.jpg?1633709144000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211008newscovid 19 fri 8th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The report reaches conclusions, based on available assessments, which become critical to business development plans.North and south, these will influence directly and indirectly the decisions by investors in generation, use and choice of technology, timing of commissioning and withdrawal of power plant, and decisions on relations to wider international energy markets.The major anticipated developments affecting particularly Northern Ireland are:: Closure of the two ageing large coal oil units at Kilroot: Commissioning of new gas fired units at Kilroot with possible run hour restrictions : Commissioning of a new high capacity interconnection link north to south in IrelandThe report emphasises the importance of the delivery of these assets on the timelines now expected.Additionally, for Northern Ireland there is an acceptance of the importance of maintaining capacity through interconnections, both from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland.Perhaps the most critical factor in preparing these forecasts is a judgment on the overall pace of growth in the likely demand for electricity which then interacts with the supply response.For the Irishmarket, the forecast demand is of a major increase stimulated by a range of iables but containing a continuing signicant growth of the Irish economy further buoyed up by an expected major increase in the number of data centres .In contrast, the report says that electricity demand in Northern Ireland is expected to grow only modestly.This contrast has serious implications for the overall conclusions. Electricity demand in Ireland is forecast to increase from  to  by %.In Northern Ireland the increase is of just under %. Underpinning this dference is an assessment that, at present, there is signicant international demand by major businesses to invest in data centres in Ireland which contrasts with the less dramatic position in Northern Ireland.In Northern Ireland, post the NI Protocol, there is the prospect of an emerging comparable access to international businessso that some spill over in this part of the international market might come ‘north of the border’.This judgment, which is partly a reflection of dfering degrees of optimism about the recovery of the economies,proved to be too pessimistic, could turn the result of the all-island assessment around so that a conclusion that electricity supply capacity in Northern Ireland is adequate may merit a more cautious conclusion.The forecast by SONI and EirGrid is based on the current interpretation of energy policies. The forecast is not driven by possible changes to make energy policy a partial driver of climate change policies.The requirement for electricity supplies to move to a regime with lower unacceptable levels of gaseous emissions is reflected in some of the assumptions made where that reflects decisions already made.This tension about possible policy questions can be illustrated by reference to the expected evolution of electricity supplies from renewable sources.In both Ireland and Northern Ireland the starting point from  is the successful development of renewable supplies in recent years.There is an acknowledgement, from official sources, that north and south there are ambitions to see renewable sources supply possibly up to % of electricity usage.There is a dference in how this % ambition affects the forecast adequacy of supplies.For forecasts for Ireland, the report quotes a currently ambitious approach to further expansion of supplies from renewables on-shore wind, solar and off-shore wind.For Northern Ireland, whilst there is satisfaction about the outcome from investment in renewables in recent years, there is a break in trends in the absence of any new incentive based scheme to further increase capacity.This poses an uncertainty which awaits the restatement of policy due later in .Will the Department for the Economy be introducing policies to incentivise further investment in renewables Northern Ireland now needs a clear policy matrix to incentivise continuing investment in renewable capacity linked to an energy storage investment and assured technology to allow greater dependence on top up supplies from interconnectors.The capacity estimates by SONI and EirGrid have offered a powerful stimulus to everyone interested in keeping the lights on in a greener economy..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBelfast restaurant Top Blade slammed for posting image of woman’s underwear on social mediaQueen’s University students get fines of more than £, for breaking Covid rulesNI model Zara Doherty: ‘It became a choice between heroin and my child.

Credit: PAOlivia FletcherOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe number of black primary and post-primary school students in Northern Ireland eligible for free school mealshas increased by more than % since , according to official figures.However, the number of white students on FSM has decreased by % in the same period.The figures from the Department of Education are based on the Northern Ireland school census and show that .% of black students were eligible for FSM in the - academic year, while % of white students were eligible in the same school year.A shocking .% of Irish Traveller students were eligible for FSM too — down from an even higher .% in the - academic year, meaning that four in five Traveller pupils were entitled to the aid at the time.Free school meals are offered to the children of parents or carers who receive benefits such as income support, Jobseeker’s allowance or Universal Credit.The meals are paid for by the Department of Education and administered by the Education Authority. The Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Koulla Yiasouma, said she was “disappointed” but “not shocked that black and minority ethnic children are disproportionately represented in the child poverty statistics”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNorthern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Koulla Yiasouma FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorthern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Koulla YiasoumaDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up And there is currently no specic policy in place to address that some minority ethnic children may be more likely to experience poverty than those from white backgrounds.The Commissioner, who advises Stormont and holds it to account on issues that affect children and young people here, told the Belfastthat “we’re not doing anywhere near enough work to lt our children out of poverty”.Ms Yiasouma said: “If we know that particular groups of children are more likely to be living in poverty — for example, such as those who are from a Travelling or minority community — then we need targeted interventions to make sure that isn’t the case.”In the - academic year, .% of black primary and post-primary school pupils were entitled to FSM, according to the statistics.And in the following year, almost % were eligible to claim.Since , Indian students have consistently been the least likely to be eligible for FSM and in the - academic year, .% of primary and post-primary students from this ethnic group were entitled to the aid.In the same year, .% of Chinese pupils and % of Pakistani pupils were eligible for FSM.In October , the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland noted in a report that children from ethnic minority backgrounds were more vulnerable to poverty, “but specic actions to address this were not apparent”.The Department for Communities is now working on an anti-poverty strategy.A spokesperson said: “The Executive’s anti-poverty strategy is being developed using a co-design approach, in line with the principles of citizen and community engagement referenced in New Decade, New Approach. The strategy will aim to address the causes of poverty and minimise its impact on iniduals within all sections of society.”A number of organisations, including the Equality Commission and the Commissioner for Children and Young People, are part of the advisory process.The Commissioner said: “We look forward to seeing how that is actually going to lt families with children out of poverty.”Poverty leads to “educational disadvantage,” Ms Yiasouma said, adding that “that is what leads to mental health issues”. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Department of EducationMinister urged to support young people who missed out on education due to Covid with new ‘catch-up’ policyPrincipal blames rising costs and supply issues as plan for £m new build derailed grammar schools in NI sign up for single transfer testDemand for integrated education in NI ‘not being met’, says charity as Stormont department criticisedStormont committee told progress made over report on underachievement in education systemMost ReadBelfast restaurant Top Blade launches appeal to reunite owner with lace thongQueen’s University students get fines of more than £, for breaking Covid rulesNI model Zara Doherty: ‘It became a choice between heroin and my child.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:n When you need the moneyn How long you want it to last for, andn How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing. Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The campaign aims to shine a light on older people and provide them with an opportunity to engage with a wide range of organisations and activities that offer support services and opportunities to socialise and learn new skills. googletag.cmd.push Derry City  Strabane District Council, the Western Health  Social Care Trust and the Public Health Agency have come together to create a erse programme of activities and events throughout October and are encouraging ious groups and organisations to get involved. Council is also currently engaging with the older community to shape a dedicated Age Friendly strategy for the City and District, prioritising older people and ensuring their health and wellbeing is a key consideration in the positive development of Derry and Strabane. Work is underway to create an Age Friendly structure with partners and stakeholders to co-design the three-year Age Friendly Strategy and action plan. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, said Positive Ageing Month celebrated the many positive aspects of growing older. He said: Positive Ageing Month offers the chance to celebrate the older members of our community, and the huge influence they have on our society. “The onus is on all of us to respect and engage with older citizens, and really value their lived experience and knowledge they bring to bear when shaping policies and programmes for our Council area.     More people within our local community are living longer, healthier lives, so we must ensure that those later years are enriching and rewarding for growing old in our area. “We must ensure that their needs are identied and prioritised and that we all take a more responsible and positive approach to le as we grow older. I hope to see lots of older people connecting with the programme and the opportunity to enjoy new activities.” Launching the campaign, Seamus Ward, Head of Health Improvement, Western Health  Social Care Trust said: “I am delighted to be launching this years Positive Ageing campaign. It is a great opportunity to showcase the fantastic work being carried out on the ground by older peoples groups and community and voluntary organisations. The programme of events that we have produced shows a iety of activities that exist throughout Derry-Londonderry, Strabane and Limavady areas for older citizens. In an ageing population, it is important we continue to work together to encourage older people to reach out and help them re-connect within their local community, not only to reduce social isolation and loneliness but to help them live long, healthy lives.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

Brae Clinic in Derry is working from a waiting list which commenced on July and there arecurrently  patients waiting to be seen. The waiting lists consists of  face-to-face consultations and  telephone consultations. googletag.cmd.push SineadMcLaughlin, SDLP, said: Waiting lists and waiting times for access to contraceptionservices in Derry and the wider Western Health area have become excessively long. “I am extremely concerned to learn that there are nearly  patients waiting to be seenand that this represents a nine-week queue for access.” She continued: While I am very sympathetic to the situation facing the Western Trust as a result of the pandemic and staff vacancies, lack of access to contraception services may lead to serious social and medical dficulties for many patients. “Family planning is an incredibly important service. It is essential that the Western Trust acts urgently to bring waiting lists and waiting times down as quickly as possible. Health Minister, Robin Swann addressed Stormont regarding the current waiting times for contraception services after McLaughlin addressed the issue. He said the COVID- pandemic had placed “immense pressure on an already reduced service.” Western Health and Social Care Trust have seen immense staff shortages over the last few months. An appeal for staff was released on September  afterAltnagelvinHospital wasunder extreme pressure caring for patients. Commenting on the contraceptive services, WHSC said: “Due to staff sickness and shortages clinics had to be cancelled and clinic capacity reduced based on available staffing levels.”     On June , at Brae Clinic,  patients were waiting for their cancelled appointment to be rescheduled and as of th September these patients have all been seen and the current waiting list wasintroduced. Contraceptionclinics in Omagh and Enniskillen are also experiencing similar problems. On average they are receiving - enquiries per day from patients looking to book anappointment. Vulnerable patients who contact or arereferredto the service are prioritised for treatment.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

Brae Clinic in Derry is working from a waiting list which commenced on July and there arecurrently  patients waiting to be seen. The waiting lists consists of  face-to-face consultations and  telephone consultations. googletag.cmd.push SineadMcLaughlin, SDLP, said: Waiting lists and waiting times for access to contraceptionservices in Derry and the wider Western Health area have become excessively long. “I am extremely concerned to learn that there are nearly  patients waiting to be seenand that this represents a nine-week queue for access.” She continued: While I am very sympathetic to the situation facing the Western Trust as a result of the pandemic and staff vacancies, lack of access to contraception services may lead to serious social and medical dficulties for many patients. “Family planning is an incredibly important service. It is essential that the Western Trust acts urgently to bring waiting lists and waiting times down as quickly as possible. Health Minister, Robin Swann addressed Stormont regarding the current waiting times for contraception services after McLaughlin addressed the issue. He said the COVID- pandemic had placed “immense pressure on an already reduced service.” Western Health and Social Care Trust have seen immense staff shortages over the last few months. An appeal for staff was released on September  afterAltnagelvinHospital wasunder extreme pressure caring for patients. Commenting on the contraceptive services, WHSC said: “Due to staff sickness and shortages clinics had to be cancelled and clinic capacity reduced based on available staffing levels.”     On June , at Brae Clinic,  patients were waiting for their cancelled appointment to be rescheduled and as of th September these patients have all been seen and the current waiting list wasintroduced. Contraceptionclinics in Omagh and Enniskillen are also experiencing similar problems. On average they are receiving - enquiries per day from patients looking to book anappointment. Vulnerable patients who contact or arereferredto the service are prioritised for treatment.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

The new greenway will start at St. Columb’s College,through TheHawthorns to Templemore Road and across to Templemore Sports Complex to UpperGalliaghRoad. The development will continue along the line of the former LoughSwillyrailway line, acrossSkeogeLink Road, and on toElaghBusiness Park. googletag.cmd.push Planning officers had providedseven reasons for refusal. One highly discussed reason to refuse was that the new greenway would run through Zoned HA housing lands. Sinn Fein Councillor Christopher Jackson said: “This is a greenway and something we have been promoting right across our city and district as a positive piece of infrastructure to allow people to choose more sustainable modes of transport.If there is zoned housing there, we should be incorporating the greenway through it.” Head of Planning Maura Fox explained: “The proposal is on housing zoned land. By severing the site with one aspect of the development, you are potentially disallowing houses in part of the zoning which has already been protected for housing.” Ken O’Sullivan, Project Manager, speaking on behalf of the Council said: “We know that the housing master plans for these lands is not yet available and we believe our proposals could be easily incorporated into any future housing masterplans on the lands.” After y debate, Councillors voted nine against refusing the planning officer’s recommendation to refuse, with four voting to for refusing the application.     The Councillors approved the application to go ahead, with conditions. The application had been previously deferred in July this year to allow for a site visit. This proposed greenway will be a part of a wide range of new greenway connections between Derry and the South.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

The new greenway will start at St. Columb’s College,through TheHawthorns to Templemore Road and across to Templemore Sports Complex to UpperGalliaghRoad. The development will continue along the line of the former LoughSwillyrailway line, acrossSkeogeLink Road, and on toElaghBusiness Park. googletag.cmd.push Planning officers had providedseven reasons for refusal. One highly discussed reason to refuse was that the new greenway would run through Zoned HA housing lands. Sinn Fein Councillor Christopher Jackson said: “This is a greenway and something we have been promoting right across our city and district as a positive piece of infrastructure to allow people to choose more sustainable modes of transport.If there is zoned housing there, we should be incorporating the greenway through it.” Head of Planning Maura Fox explained: “The proposal is on housing zoned land. By severing the site with one aspect of the development, you are potentially disallowing houses in part of the zoning which has already been protected for housing.” Ken O’Sullivan, Project Manager, speaking on behalf of the Council said: “We know that the housing master plans for these lands is not yet available and we believe our proposals could be easily incorporated into any future housing masterplans on the lands.” After y debate, Councillors voted nine against refusing the planning officer’s recommendation to refuse, with four voting to for refusing the application.     The Councillors approved the application to go ahead, with conditions. The application had been previously deferred in July this year to allow for a site visit. This proposed greenway will be a part of a wide range of new greenway connections between Derry and the South.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

Drumboe left Whitehead in Co Antrim, where it has been restored, early on Saturday on its way to the Donegal Railway Heritage Museum in Donegal Town where it will go on display. googletag.cmd.push The -tonne engine, which travelled on a low-loader, passed through Derry, Strabane, Stranorlar, Ballybofey and Barnesmore Gap, before arriving in Donegal Town. It stopped at the Tinneys in Strabane, the former site of the railway station to which it made its last journey in December . The engine also stopped on Barnesmore Gap, the scene of many iconic photographs of the engine in its heyday. Following its arrivial in Donegal Town, Drumboe will be lted into position on a new presentation  at the museum. The Drumboe engine was one of half a dozen built for the Donegal railways in  and . It has become the iconic steam engine of the era of railways in Donegal.Two years in the making The project tothe engine into the county cost €, with funding from Leader on top of fundraising. Theof the engine has been more than two years in the making. As well as the restoration of the engine, the project has included the building of a new presentation  and canopy at the museum. The manager of the museum Nial McCaughan explained there is a lot of excitement about theof the engine.     “This is a big thing for the museum but also for the county,” he said. “This is the first Donegal steam engine to be back in the county. It’s also the very engine that sadly left on the very last journey on December,   - the very last passenger service that left Donegal Town for Strabane. So it has come full circle - it is coming back to Donegal Town and it is a great thing for us all.” He said there are plans that the engine, which has been restored “from a rusting hulk,” will be run again on tracks in Donegal. Most of the engine has been fully restored to an operational state so that when funding becomes available, it could go back into steam. “We would love to put Drumboe back in operation - that is that plan,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

An Greacuteasaacuten and Gael Linn – one of the main Irish Language organisations in Ireland – have published an open letter to the Department in North asking them to intervene. The letter was signed by over  teachers, speakers and activists. googletag.cmd.push In it, the letter said the  disapplication of the requirement for all pupils to study an additional language at GCSE, “had detrimental consequences for the study of languages and Irish in particular”. The letter also cited a  per cent reduction of students studying Irish at GCSE level since  and called for the  disapplication to be reversed so that pupils must pick a language as one of their GCSE choices – be it Irish, French, German or Spanish. Sinn Feacutein MLA Delargy said: “I have great admiration and respect for the teachers who have signed this letter and are demanding better from the Department. “The figures presented in the letter make for stark reading, it is clear the emphasis of the curriculum has placed on STEMsubjects over recent years to the detriment of languages. “There have been numerous shortcomings from the Department over the last number of years in relation to the language, these trends must be reversed. “While the Irish medium sector continues to grow unbounded, it’s time to look at the language and other languages within the English Medium Sector.     “Sinn Feacutein supports the demands made in the letter and will engage with the Department as they encourage our pupils to study a language.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

The Foyle MLA also confirmed that Sinn Feacutein will bring a motion to the Assembly on Monday calling for action to end this crisis. A drop in the number of HGV drivers, due to European workers now seeking work in EU member states following Britains exit from the EU, has led to supermarkets and petrol stations in Great Britain reporting of shortages. googletag.cmd.push The north of Ireland is in a dferent situation as due to it retaining its Single Market status post-Brexit, goods and petrol have been in supply. However, Delargy said the norths own economy needed HGV drivers from the EU to ensure that shoppers and car drivers can still have at-point-access to goods and fuel. He said: “Boris Johnson and his government’s Brexit has created a crisis in the production of agri-food and the transporting of goods through lorry driver shortages. “Alongside the reckless move to end freedom of movement with its xenophobic undercurrents which has seen many EU citizens leaving, the Tories are refusing to recognise the need to ensure skilled workers from across the EU who want to work here can do so. “The British Government needs to find a solution to the problem of labour shortages which they created through their hard Brexit and ensure EU citizens can work in the north. “Sinn Feacutein’s Assembly motion calls on the Economy Minister to put pressure on the British government to act to end the labour shortage crisis and resolve the issues facing workers and local businesses.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The balance on how to create nutritious, easy-to-prepare school lunches five days a week that kids will love too is a continuous challenge. Healthy Heroes, the lunchtime nutrition programme from the Irish Bread Bakers Association and Bord Bia, offers plenty of simple suggestions. googletag.cmd.push Their latest programme is already underway in hundreds of primary schools around the country aiming to help children improve their eating habits for the better and increase their fitness levels. Studies show that just one in ten Irish childrenmeet the national physical activity guidelines, while at least one in five nationally are still overweight or obese. Created by teachers and behaviour change experts, with the support of Dr Mary McCreery, one of Ireland’s leading consultant nutritionists and dieticians, the schools-based lunchtime programme recognises the importance of intervening early so children develop healthy eating behaviours before they leave primary school. It aims to increase the nutritional value of the lunch box with useful tips and suggestions on ways to include fruit and vegetables in lunch boxes as well as easy – to- understand information on the food pyramid and the contents of the ideal lunch box. The programme involves a novel peer learning approach with sixth class students mentoring younger students on the importance of nutrition and being active. This provides the younger children with important role models, while the older children have an opportunity to foster valuable leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. According to Dr McCreery, school lunchtime is an important opportunity to develop positive attitudes towards food choices and nutrition, leading to le-long eating habits. She offersthe following tips to parents when it comes to school lunches:     Set a good example by eating a iety of foods yourself and make your own lunch at the same time so your child knows how much you enjoy them.Introduce new foods without any special comment so your child can make their own mind upthey like them or not. Make sure you have a wide range of foods available at home. Try to offer dferent foods every day. Shopping in advance is the best way to ensure you have plenty of iety for lunch boxes. Include a carbohydrate, a protein, dairy, fruit, and veg in their lunch boxes. To provide a balanced diet educate your child that treats are for weekends and special occasions. Involve your child in the food shopping to encourage themto pick healthy options for their school lunch. And here are some balanced lunch suggestions from the latest Healthy Heroes programme.

A European Studies student from Waterford, Maireacutead Butler, will use the opportunity to raise awareness with Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin about the challenges still facing girls and women. Speaking about the event, Maireacutead said it isnt good enough that no woman has ever held the office of Taoiseach, but that she was delighted to be part of the takeover. googletag.cmd.push She said, I hope girls across the country will see this and be able to envision themselves in this office one day. The  year old, who is a member of Plan International Irelands Youth Advisory Panel, will also discuss the results of the groups recent research into sexual and reproductive health misinformation in Irish schools. She said, Im grateful to have the opportunity to present the findings to the Taoiseach today.Most concerning were the responses we received about consent, contraception and LGBTI+ identities. “The reality is that when young people are not armed with the right info on sexual and reproductive health, girls and young women are at particular risk of being subjected to sexual and gender-based violence and early pregnancy. Similar takeover events are taking place around the world today, giving girls and young women the chance to sit in the seats of leaders in politics and business, particularly traditionally male-dominated positions.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

A source close to the country star has said It becomes a big story for Garthhe gets the five nights at Croke Park he was denied before. Three nights won’t be enough. googletag.cmd.push He wants his full five shows at leasthe is ever toto Ireland. Hundreds of residents in the Croke Park area met beside the venue last week with stadium management and Aiken Promotions with concerns over the amount of concerts being planned. Residents are outraged that there could be seven potential concerts held next year and it could go to the High Court, but Dublin City Council could still refuse as they did back in . As it stands under restrictions, only three gigs can take place in Croke Park in a calendar year between January and February. As there has not been a live show in Croke Park since July , Aiken Promotions have been hoping that this would allow them room to negotiate for more gigs in . Garth Brooks May Move Gigs To Aviva If  Croker Nights Falls Through - https:t.co JfNXSWs pic qjsWujjA — Radio Nova  October ,     Pending this decision, insiders say that Brooks is willing to move some of his shows to the Aviva Stadium,hes request for five nights at Croker is denied. “But Garth could do three nights in Croke Park then another three concerts in the Aviva Stadium”,the source continued.     “He could do what Ed Sheeran did in  and add in even more concerts around the regions. This is also causing issues as Sheeran himself has booked two concerts in April . Research has shown that each Brooks gig could possibly generate €million to the local economy. Another study also showed that one concert ticket sold for a Brooks concert would provide € spent in the local area. “They remained steadfast before, and there’s no reason to think they’ll cave in to Garth this time”. “DCC are more into bicycles than heavy lorries so it doesn’t take much imagination to get their view on a fleet of heavy artics rolling in and out of Croke Park for an unprecedented numbers of concerts, added the source. The country singeris already pencilled in to perform in Croke Park for September ,  and  in .Applications have already been lodged to get two extra dates added to this.

Conor has dabbled in open mike nights over the years with great feedback however found himself struggling to find the confidence to next the next step into the world of gigging. googletag.cmd.push However, after multiple lockdowns, playing his acoustic guitar within the confines of his home, he took plunge and into the world of gigging and hasn’t looked back since. Conor’s book is open for bookings for weekday and weekend slots throughout the Northwest Like most of us, Conor’s le grinded to a halt during COVID. Not being able to do the things he loved he decided once again to wipe the dust off his old guitar and give this singing thing a go. Luckily for Conor his work from home schedule at times wasn’t overly demanding so he found himself homing in on his guitar skills between meetings. He credits both his music and his love of the outdoors for keeping his sanity throughout the winter lockdown of . A keen swimmer, Conor found himself using the cold water, taking regular dips in Enagh Lough throughout the week to stay present and focused, alleviating the worries and uncertainty that gripped the nation during COVID times. Coming out the far side Conor sees exciting times ahead for himself. “COVID had really made me realise that the most important thing in le is to do the things that really get me excited.     “Le is short and tomorrow it could be gone, so don’t take anything for granted. “I’ve discovered my love for music and live performing and this is something I really want to peruse.

Fronted by Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite, they confidently wander the border between Indie Rock and Americana — sounding like a long overdue meeting of the minds of Pinegrove, Frightened Rabbit and Julien Baker AND THEY release “Where We All End Up In The End” on October . The album will be released in its entirety on Bandcamp on  October, followed by single releases on DSPs each month thereafter. To give listeners a taste of the album, smallmint will perform a streamed album launch gig on  October and release the fourth and final single ‘Pseudonym’ on DSPs on  October. I don’t know for sure but I’m going to say that DSPs are download streaming s. Hot Press have said The layered production, melodic guitar hooks and enthralling dynamics come together to form a striking and powerful sound and they know a thing or two. The Last Mixed Tape have said A well-crafted piece of songwriting, the bands sound moves dynamically with each twist in the song’s tail”, but I don’t believe they’re the actual last mixed tape and Chorblossom have predictably said Drenched in dreamy Americana vibes, Liv is a superb second single from smallmint, I’d love to see them rip into someone meself. ‘Where we all end up in the end’ began le in , when live tracking commenced at Smalltown America Studios in Derry. Smallmint worked closely together with producer Caolaacuten Austin to achieve the sound on the record. Frontman Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite wears his emotional intricacies on his sleeve through his vocal delivery and upfront lyricism, all set to a musical backdrop of crunchy electric guitars and pounding drums. The result is a confident statement of intent — a testament to the band’s hard work, musicianship, and their own high standards. He said: “We wanted the album to feel natural and to actually sound like a band playing live in a room, which is exactly how it was recorded. It was important for us to keep that space and energy in the recordings - no need for overproduction or too many overdubs, we wanted to let the arrangement of the music by the band, and the lyrics speak for themselves.” Check them out on facebook smallmintband or instagram smallmintband or even www  smallmintbandADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Sile Gallagher, Post Mistress Amanda Brogan and Joanne Martin celebrate after news broke that their Bangor Erris Post Office in Ballina, Co.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs. It provides basic shelter, comfort and security. A home also affords personal dignity, a space for privacy and a foundation for family le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Best wishes to Knockevin staff  ","story":"SLIEVE Croob councillors Cathy Mason and Roiacutesiacuten Howell paid a recent visit to the new Knockevin senior school in Castlewellan.Located on the site of the former Castlewellan Primary School in the town, the councillors welcomed staff and students and hope that they will be very happy and will be warmly welcomed by the wider community.Cllr Howell said the global pandemic had ldquosignicantly disrupted the education of the special school pupils and impacted on their learning, communication and mental health.She extended best wishes to school principal Sarah Liddell and senior department leader Gillian Rea.ldquoWhilst the children have been on the premises from September, there are still issues that I and Cllr Mason will be working closely with the school, the Education Authority and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ensure that staff and pupils have the best all round experience on their newly refurbished site, added Cllr Howell.Cllr Mason said Knockevin caters for pupils with severe and profound learning dficulties aged between  and  and aims to provide a supportive educational environment where they feel secure, at their ease and thrive both educationally, socially and spiritually.She said the main school is located in Downpatrick, with an Early Years Centre in Dundrum.ldquoNow we have the senior school in Castlewellan which will seek to help pupils achieve their maximum level of independence in preparation for le when their education finishes, said Cllr Mason.She added: ldquoHaving visited the Downpatrick site in recent months I have seen first hand how happy and content the children are in school..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_bid.jpg","title":"Bid to save St Mary’s school from closure  ","story":"GOVERNORS and staff have pledged to try and save a primary school in Saintfield from closure.St Maryrsquos Primary School is earmarked to close by August  next year due to low pupil numbers.The Education Authority last week published the closure proposal seeking any objections or support to be lodged by November .The proposal was made by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the schoolrsquos trustees.It states enrolment to the  year-old school on the Old Grand Jury Road has dwindled to  pupils for this academic year, with the majority in the Primary  and  classes.The proposal claims there is currently only one pupil in the schoolrsquos Primary ,  and  classes, two pupils in Primary  and no pupils in Primary .A spokesperson for CCMS said: ldquoCCMS has carried out initial consultation on the closure of St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield, which is a Down and Connor diocesan school.

These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges.

However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others.

Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage. His mother is vice-principal at St Patrickrsquos.Cormac hopes to major in Government and graduate in , but has taken the opportunity to get involved in other activities such as being admitted to the John F Kennedy Junior Forum.Cormac was one of  people accepted out of  applications.ldquoItrsquos really competitive to get into to so I threw my hat into the ring not expecting to get it so I was completely blown away when I did. he said.ldquoThe group organises heads of states, politicians and leaders in business to visit campus where we moderate discussions and debates with them and a student audience.ldquoWhile Irsquom on the digital marketing team helping to promote the events, I could also find myself on stage later this year with Nancy Pelosi, the serving Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is completely mind-blowing.Cormac has suggested inviting Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission mdash a sign of his continuing interest in all things European.He met President Joe Biden when he was  after an opportunistic letter to him turned out to be beneficial.ldquoI was a massive Biden fan long before he ran for President and Irsquom still very proud that I predicted his presidency four years ago.

My parents and I got the chance to meet him in Dublin the day after the Brexit vote.ldquoIrsquom more likely to ask him nowhersquos going over to Ireland, would he give me a lt on Air Force One, he joked.Cormac is still not behind the door connecting with famous people with his red hair helping him engage with TV host and producer mdash and fellow redhead mdash Conan OrsquoBrien when the former Hard student gave an address to new students.ldquoThe rest of the guys suggested we get a picture together as we look alike but he was great fun. The best thing was that I was wearing my Red High GAA shirt, said Cormac.While he has taken Hard and the US to his heart, Cormac retains his real love for his home.ldquoIrsquove really loved the adventure of having to adapt to the American culture and my three best friends here are all Americans.

The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better. Part of this includes the new walking path.Cllr Trainor said the work to provide the new path is ongoing with people already taking an interest in it.He added: ldquoI appeal to those responsible for a series of incidents at Dunleath Park to stop what they are doing and realise the consequences of their actions.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December .

It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what

Primary School in Crossgar.Nine representatives from a primary school, a hospital and a church of the Embangweni Station sang Malawian songs and shared stories about their home with the pupils.With the aim of the visit to share cultures the visitors were offered Irish stew and watched the pupils perform Irish dancing.The school children were amazed to hear how their guests had never been on a plane, boat or train before and how they only earn around pound a year.School principal, Mr Harry Murray, said he was delighted to have the visitors at the school so his students could hear for themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative image of the area.He claimed both councillors asked for a decision to approve expansion work at the plant to be deferred on ldquohearsay evidence and suggested they never checked what he described as the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a petition containing , signatures in support of the controversial development at the Gocean.The plan to develop a -acre site, including a new marina, has split public opinion in the town, but local community worker Billy Walker said he believes an increasing number of people are now backing what is one of the biggest ever private investment schemes in the district.In March, planning officials confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side. The former Poacutec Fhaacuteda runner up, has the strongest re-starts in Division , and she launched numerous attacks, drilling accurately into the paths of Catherine McKay, Leanne Kelly and Claire Marie McCann.Her one delivery that went astray, was collected by Gordon in the th minute, who superbly struck over the bar from the tightest of angles.Jenny Greene had a good battle throughout with Cara Doyle, as did young Anna McVarnock with Niamh McEvoy.McVarnock played a superb crossfield ball into the path of Ryan, just before half time, who finished emphatically to the net, giving the Kevinrsquos a healthy eleven point lead at the break with a half time score of - to -.The second half provided further evidence of the intelligent structured game that Kevinrsquos are increasingly playing.Better combination and link-up play, especially between defence and attack, is leading to improved performance levels. The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13081159.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark GourleyAlmost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin SwannPan unionist legal challenge to NI protocol on hold as changes expected Aurora Borealis: Northern Lights could be visible in NI as geomagnetic storm expected to reach EarthLord Frost and Simon Coveney in NI Protocol twitter spatMost PopularPUP annual conference: Billy Hutchinson tells members that ‘shared island is a hood’Dennis Hutchings challenges evidence in trial over  killing that identies him as a soldier in witness statementsThousands of chickens killed as NIFRS tackle large shed fire at Northern Ireland farmUlster Unionist Party leader looked confident on stage but was defensive on TVStrictly Come Dancing : Who left Strictly last night  Results of Strictly Come Dancing                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The resulting health crisis shows the inbuilt problems with our devolved institutions. The tendency to shirk responsibility, to think short-term and to ignore hard choicesOn Saturday, I fell off my bicycle and smashed my left wrist. As a result, firstly I was sedated and given a procedure to stabilise and reposition the bone. Then, the next morning, my joint was rebuilt during several hours of surgery at Royal Victoria Hospital. I’ve written about the NHS quite a bit over the years. But an up close and personal experience always helps put things in a sharper perspective.That’s primarily because, as a patient, you can’t help but be struck by the kindness, dedication and professionalism of almost every member of staff you meet in hospital.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...They really are remarkable people, with reserves of caring and empathy that most of us can only wonder at. It’s all the more impressive that they display these qualities under such challenging circumstances.For example, the nurses who show endless reserves of patience through the small hours of the night while they are abused and sometimes even threatened by distressed patients. These are often older people, confused and delirious, who are not in any way responsible for their behaviour, but they still say hurtful, potentially intimidating things. It’s a special skill to be able to deal with that, calmly and firmly, in the middle of a busy sht.When you are in hospital receiving care, you see that staff are working incredibly hard, often without breaks, while remaining helpful, interested and sympathetic to every patient. But there are dficulties with the system too. It is busy and struggling to cope.I was unfortunate, or perhaps not, that I had an open wound on my broken joint. There was a risk that it would become infected and that was why I had my operation quickly. The surgeons were blunt that,it hadn’t been for the cut, I would probably have had to wait much longer. Indeed, many patients were waiting considerable s of time, some of them in terrible pain, for essential operations on broken legs, hips and other bones or joints. The lists for emergency surgery are long and growing.There is clearly considerable pressure on beds, with some people waiting in discomfort in A  E or in inappropriate wards or bays. But, at the same time, it can be a y and frustrating process being discharged, even after that decision has been taken and plans have been made to fill the bed. Everybody’s doing their jobs with the utmost professionalism, but there are snags and bottlenecks that hold everything up and give an impression of inefficiency.For an explanation, we have to go back to Stormont and the failure of successive health ministers to reform the NHS in Northern Ireland. Since at least , and the Transforming Your Care report, but arguably as long ago as  when the late Maurice Hayes published his recommendations, experts have repeatedly pointed out what needs to happen.We know that there should be a smaller number of acute hospitals with a greater concentration of expertise and more resources should be directed at providing care in the community. In addition, there are dficulties with staffing, particularly in certain jobs and specialties. Rather than act on these requirements, the executive at Stormont repeatedly delayed taking necessary but potentially unpopular decisions.In , the Donaldson Report made specic recommendations to close facilities and reorganise services. It was parked, due to one of Stormont’s periodic crises, and when the assembly got back to some sort of normality, in , the new minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill, commissioned a new review, Bengoa, which made broadly the same points, but presented them in more general terms. It’s an endless, circular process sustained by politicians who refuse to take responsibility for dficult decisions, like closing smaller hospitals. The latest incumbent at the health ministry, Robin Swann, has had to deal with Covid, so you can understand perhaps why reform has not taken priority, but no great change seems imminent. Remember that, just before coronavirus arrived, in December , there was already a nurses’ strike and medics predicted that the system was close to breakdown.The pattern is clear, and Stormont’s refusal to act has allowed NI’s NHS to become outdated in comparison with services in the rest of the UK. Our politicians have let down its brilliant employees badly and repeatedly. Indeed, the crisis in health offers a neat case-study of many of the inbuilt problems with our devolved institutions. Their tendency to encourage shirking responsibility, thinking only about the short-term, taking the easiest choices and ignoring more dficult ones, blaming everybody .Unavoidably, the unionist parties’ most pressing problem at the next election is the protocol. However, in terms of making Stormont work, an honest, responsible approach to government that confronts long-term problems, rather than denying or ignoring them, is something that voters will think is long overdue.Royal Victoria HospitalNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark GourleyAlmost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin SwannPan unionist legal challenge to NI protocol on hold as changes expected Aurora Borealis: Northern Lights could be visible in NI as geomagnetic storm expected to reach EarthLord Frost and Simon Coveney in NI Protocol twitter spatMost PopularPUP annual conference: Billy Hutchinson tells members that ‘shared island is a hood’Dennis Hutchings challenges evidence in trial over  killing that identies him as a soldier in witness statementsUlster Unionist Party leader looked confident on stage but was defensive on TVThousands of chickens killed as NIFRS tackle large shed fire at Northern Ireland farmStrictly Come Dancing : Who left Strictly last night  Results of Strictly Come Dancing                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was also right to oppose an Irish language act.There have been times more recently when UUP politicians have seemed too flexible on contentious issues, at a time when NI’s place in the UK is under overt but also covert attack.It was good on Saturday to see Mr Beattie speak so firmly against the NI Protocol, as he did at the Tory conference in Manchester last week, alongside the DUP and TUV leaders.As he says, it does great damage to the successes of the  Belfast Agreement.It was good also to hear the health minister Robin Swann speaking so emphatically about his opposition to the protocol legal impediment to the movement of NHS drugs into NI.Meanwhile, Lord Frost is still taking a firm public line against the Irish Sea border.Let us hope this all brings results.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
