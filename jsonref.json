That is the case of the Tabajaras favela, which has a spectacular view of the famous Copacabana beach district below.\u0027Here, people are very afraid,\u0027 said Vania Ribeiro, vice president of the local neighborhood association.\u0027The nearest health centre is the same that the elderly people in Copacabana and tourists from all over the world use,\u0027 she said. The usual guidelines for how to protect oneself from the coronavirus, \u0027social distancing\u0027 and \u0027barrier gestures,\u0027 are difficult to apply here.\u0027We are told that we have to wash our hands all the time, but what if the running water is regularly cut off?

How can you isolate an infected person in these conditions?\u0027 asked Buss.Beyond the high population density, unsanitary conditions in some dwellings also pose problems.\u0027In the favela, most houses have few windows, which prevents good air circulation, prevents daylight from entering and promotes the spread of respiratory diseases,\u0027 said Patricia Canto, pulmonologist at the National School of Public Health.In particular, tuberculosis continues to wreak havoc in the favelas, with infection rates sometimes 10 times higher than the national average.\u0027For the coronavirus, we say that we must protect the most vulnerable by talking about the elderly, but we must not forget the cases of social vulnerability,\u0027 said Canto. In addition, many people depend on the informal economy to make a living, and confinement risks taking away all forms of subsistence.Rio has so far escaped the total confinement regime being experienced in much of Europe and neighbouring Argentina.But schools and shops have been closed, as have beaches and other tourist spots, where many street vendors from poor neighborhoods sell their products.\u0027People who do not have a formal job must continue to go out to work because they have no choice. Either they die of hunger, or they risk dying by catching the coronavirus,\u0027 said Joelma Sousa, of the NGO Redes da Mare, located in a set of favelas near Rio\u0027s international airport. Coronavírus: traficantes e milicianos impõem toque de recolher em comunidades do Rio | Rio de Janeiro | G1"},{"url":null,"title":"Michael Gove apologises WRONGLY saying children separated parents travel homes","story":"Share this article Britain\u0027s 66million people are today beginning a new life in coronavirus lockdown after Boris Johnson ordered the immediate closure of all non-essential shops and threatened people with fines or even arrest if they do not \u0027stay at home\u0027.

Although his cautionary Americana fables didn’t always have a happy ending, the raspy-voiced musician delivered them with more warmth than a shot of bourbon around a campfire, somehow ensuring that you always ended up smiling.But the celebrated country singer, who has died of natural causes at the age of 81, wasn’t just great at telling stories through song. He also used photography, releasing several books, and receiving an honorary degree from the Professional Photographers of America (PPA). “He’s obviously well-known as an entertainer,” said PPA president Ralph Romaguera when giving Rogers his award in 2014, “but he truly is a remarkably talented photographer, too.”Covering landscapes and portraits, Rogers’ images shift between giddily capturing the larger-than-life personas of such friends as Ray Charles and Dolly Parton, to documenting the natural beauty of America’s vast countryside. He could make familiar sights look like a fairytale: his glowing night time shot of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, proudly uploaded to his Facebook page in 2017, makes the 16th US president look more like a mystical levitating god than a statue for tourists to mill around.Armed with a 35mm Brownie Hawkeye, Rogers enjoyed taking long walks on the look-out for unique trees. The camera also became a way to stave off boredom while touring America and bringing his signature brand of accessibly nostalgic country pop to fan-filled arenas. “I only worked an hour a day,” Rogers said of life on the road in 2014. “That meant I had 23 hours with nothing to do.”In that interview, with Sports \u0026amp Entertainment Nashville, he added: “So we’d get up in the morning, get in the car, and drive around whatever city we were in and ask the locals whether there was anything good to shoot. A lot of the time they’d say, ‘No, I’ve lived here 30 year and there’s nothing.’ And then you’d turn round the corner and you’d find Niagara Falls.”Although he loved taking portraits of his fourth wife, the model Marianne Gordon, Rogers clearly saw photography as much more than just a hobby. At the height of his fame in the 1980s and 90s, he found time for private lessons with acclaimed photographers, from Yousuf Karsh to John Sexton. “Karsh taught me how to capture the personality of a celebrity by making them feel at ease,” said Rogers. “When you see them totally relaxed, that’s when you shoot. John taught me the importance of really loving what you photograph.”Working under these giants of photography, Rogers reached another level. His equipment grew more sophisticated, too. He moved from a Linhof Master Technika 4x5-inch to larger-format cameras capable of producing more arresting 8x10 negatives. The Thumb, one of his most striking shots, captures a digit-like mountaintop in bold black and white. With the moon hovering low in the sky and the stark rock outlines, it resembles a still from a science-fiction movie, lit with dark mystique. Like many of Rogers’s environmental photographs, it has real depth, accentuating the shadows. It’s as if he was suggesting that America, even at its most beautiful, had something sinister lurking in the darkness. You could say the same about many of his songs, particularly Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town.His celebrity portraits are particularly vivid. In 1987, Rogers published Your Friends and Mine, full of portraits of superstars from Elizabeth Taylor to Michael Jackson. He also photographed the likes of Willie Nelson and Tammy Wynette for his 2005 photo book This Is My Country. Most of these celebrities looks at ease and relaxed, acutely aware that the person behind the camera was one of them and had no agenda.That said, Rogers’s shot of Michael Jackson awkwardly clutching his pet chimpanzee Bubbles like a ventriloquist’s dummy feels as if it was intended to be a little more ironic than his usual work. Here, arguably, Rogers captured the unnerving bombast of Jackson’s eccentric celebrity more clearly than just about any other photographer.One of Rogers’s biggest lessons came from the Canadian portrait photographer George Hurrell, who taught the singer how to create a connection with his subjects that would spill over into the final product.“He came down to my place in Georgia and spent some time with me,” Rogers told the Associated Press. “George said to me, ‘I am gonna tell you a trick. I call it the stolen moment!’ He said to talk to your subject about the happiest day of their life and also the saddest day of their life. Just as they respond to the question, you take the picture. It means they are not posing, but rather being who they truly are. It’s honestly such a great trick.”Often, when celebrities announce that they enjoy taking photographs, we brace ourselves for a dire, staged selfie or shot of a lurid pink swimming pool. Rogers was proof that, occasionally, a celebrity could be just as arresting behind the camera as they were in front of it.Last June, Rogers posted one of his photos to Instagram, something he did regularly in his later years. Taken while on tour, it deals with all the things the country singer seemed to be most fond of: epic mountaintops, gorgeous if slightly eerie moonlight, and trees that stand like gods. It’s easy to imagine a silver-haired Rogers, probably in a cowboy hat, smiling behind the camera, just taking it all in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24f361682dc2154a09a9c06c47de2698b0fb3115/0_1754_8353_5012/master/8353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3f37f86781cfab3b04c821733244676","title":"sacha alexis pazoumian life in earths deepest deep freeze in pictures","story":"It is one of chilliest spots on the planet.

At its centre as a former first minister of Scotland – the man who secured a referendum on independence, thought the stuff of fantasy not many years before. This was the man who had led his party to a majority government in the Holyrood parliament in spite of a proportional system designed to prevent any such electoral outcome.And then, five and half years after he resigned, Alex Salmond found himself in the dock in Edinburgh’s high court, accused of 14 sex-related offences, including nine charges of sexual assault and one of attempted rape. In the event, one charge of sexual assault was dropped, and he was found not guilty by a majority verdict of all but one of the remainder. The final charge received the Scottish third verdict, of not proven, thus acquitting Salmond of all charges. (Scottish courts have 15 jurors – though only 13 were there on the final day – and require a simple majority to convict.)It was his second legal victory. In the first, a year ago, he successfully won a case against what had once been his own government when it admitted mishandling the investigation into his conduct. But this week’s proceedings, and the verdict, are of much greater consequence.In one sense, the collateral damage may be rather less than first anticipated. Inevitably, the coronavirus pandemic has wiped most other news off the front pages on both sides of the border. Nevertheless it is not a small political earthquake.The outcome has ided the feminist community as well as the political one. Organisations such as Rape Crisis Scotland issued a statement of support for complainants who appear in court, and noted an increase in calls to its helpline during this high-profile case. Some older women, however, often with vivid memories of different cultural times, considered a number of the allegations relatively trivial.Inevitably, that relationship was to break down. Not least because some of the women who made allegations against Salmond were close to both Sturgeon and the SNP. And, indeed, all of them operated within the Scottish political village. Further, Salmond became openly critical of Sturgeon as pre-trial battle lines were joined.The trial also highlighted – some would argue promoted – isions between those who still hankered after the bullish style of a Salmond leadership, and those thankful for the more cautious, measured tones of his successor.Some fretted about SNP tactics on other matters – waiting too patiently, as they saw it, for permission for a second independence referendum against which the prime minister had set his face and in the process losing the momentum of a Brexit scenario where almost two-thirds of Scots had voted to remain in Europe. Others argued that any such poll held without specific legal underpinning would lead to mass abstentions by unionist voters, and a disputed result.When both Joanna Cherry, the SNP’s justice spokesperson in Westminster, and Angus Robertson, the party’s former Westminster leader, recently threw their hats into the ring to contest the same Edinburgh seat in next year’s Scottish elections, these rival camps became more vociferous.Cherry, the QC who helped derail the proposed five-week prorogation of the Commons in September, and Robertson, the strategist behind many SNP electoral victories, were often characterised as proxies for Salmond and Sturgeon. Both are now seeking the SNP nomination for the seat won with a tiny majority by Ruth Davidson, one-time leader of the Scottish Tories. She is not standing again, and seems likely to go to the Lords at the invitation of Boris Johnson. Who will get the SNP’s nod is meant to be decided next month.Following the Salmond verdict, there was also much talk of several inquiries thrown up by the court case and its denouement. The Scottish Tories, predictably, talk of a political scandal and seem set to pursue questions as to what Nicola Sturgeon knew of the allegations and when.The Holyrood parliament seems likely to want to query the role of the civil service, given that some of the accusers were from its ranks. And there will inevitably be questions over the strength of the prosecution case given that none of the charges brought resulted in a conviction.However, none of the above are high on the Scottish political agenda right now.

People on decent salaries hit by the Covid-19 fallout are in for a shockMillions of people are about to discover something they didn’t know about British life. There is no longer a safety net. People who have paid tax and national insurance for years and never been near the social security system will be turning to it in their hour of need yet far too late, like trapeze artists falling through the air, they will find that the net beneath them has been lowered dangerously close to the ground and is badly torn.If these people once believed relentlessly misleading tabloid tales of benefit scroungers, they will have a rude awakening. They will find that when Iain Duncan Smith turned the screw on social security in 2012, he was right to warn claimants: “This is not an easy life any more, chum.” As if it ever was.Let’s hope that injustice is fixed. But even then, watch the shock as millions fall on the untender mercies of the Department for Work and Pensions, to discover what happened to benefits in the past decade. While never over-generous, by 2010 Labour had greatly lifted living standards for low earners, especially for children: Gordon Brown’s tax credits raised a million children and a million pensioners out of poverty. Since 2010, according to new research by Kerris Cooper and John Hills, a professor at the London School of Economics, children have lost a quarter of the support they had chancellor George Osborne and his successors took out a staggering nearly £40bn from benefits. Never “all in this together”, Osborne justified it by raining down abuse on low-paid families. The hypocrisy: as the current editor of the London Evening Standard, he ran Christmas collections for poor families! The Resolution Foundation predicts a third of children falling into poverty by 2023.Some cuts were secretive, uprating benefits by a meaner CPI not RPI inflation rate, a four-year freeze, and axing council tax support. Some made a noise – such as the bedroom tax, costing some families £14 week for a spare room. An early case was a Hartlepool family whose empty room belonged to their recently deceased 10-year-old. Housing benefit for renters was cut brutally. Introducing the two-child limit was exceptionally unjust.Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation, says people on £50,000 salaries have been anxiously asking him about benefits rates. They’re in for a shock, he says. Unlike the previous tax credit system, universal credit only allows savings of £6,000 (it takes steep deductions from savings up to £16,000). People hoping this is only temporary will be distraught at having to use up their rainy-day funds, often saved for years for a deposit on a home. The foundation is lobbying urgently to have this savings means-test dropped.Hills says a couple with two children will get £266 a week. And take from that £115 – the average amount that housing benefit falls short of rental payments. Many new claimants will run up rent arrears. Expect them to plunge immediately into poverty, miles below the £384 minimum income standard for a family of four, says Hills. Some singles will get a shock too. Under-35s will be living on £73, and only funded for a room in a shared flat, in the cheapest third of rentals in the area. Many who see themselves as middle class will confront the reality of Britain’s nonexistent safety net. It is, says the IFS’s Paul Johnson, “extraordinarily low”. One piece of advice from all these experts I’ve talked to: apply immediately, to limit these delays and debts. “Too many will wait, borrow from family, deny it’s happening to them, feeling the stigma. Apply at once,” says Torsten Bell.These millions discovering DWP brutality at first hand will no longer be deceived by the old poison shaming those on benefits as loafers, frauds and “not people like us”. Benefits offer penury, not a life of Riley. Rishi Sunak has been lavishly praised, not least for his empathic language: “We will be judged by our capacity for compassion”. But his compassion will be judged by how far he keeps benefit rates below the most basic poverty line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/551b1fe4e53e18d9ab0d1f570e176b257b2c69fc/0_0_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946001468bfeb765688bcc011d0f2bcb","title":"deliveroo driver coronavirus help contract government hardship fund","story":"People like me are key workers, yet we still have no safety net from the government and face poverty if we self-isolate• See all our coronavirus coverageIf you order in with Deliveroo, I’m the guy who brings it to you, day or night, no matter the weather and whatever the risk. And those risks are greater now than I ever imagined they could be. With the UK on lockdown, I and thousands of other delivery workers are still out there trying to get provisions to people who need them – and at the same time keep roofs over our heads.Yet it sometimes feels like we’re working with a timebomb in our backpack. And the government is not taking our role in the Covid-19 crisis seriously.I’m a father of three and I’m used to working 12-hour days. It was June 2018 when I swapped my green Starbucks apron for a bulky backpack and a pushbike. Like many, I was lured in by slogans like “Earn great money”, “Choose when you work”, “Make as much as £120 a day”. The dream of flexible, well-paid self-employment was real and I was ready to pedal after it. I’d been pedalling ever since, until two weeks ago when I developed a cough and breathing difficulties.Even though I was desperate to protect those around me, making the decision to self-isolate was extremely difficult because my partner is on statutory maternity pay and the family relies on my income. We’re not eligible for statutory sick pay at Deliveroo, so I was relieved when the company announced a multimillion-pound Rider Support Fund that promised financial support for those forced to self-isolate. I wasn’t expecting much from Deliveroo but at least, in these extraordinary times, it was offering something. So I went into isolation.Yet I didn’t see a penny. Deliveroo asked me to submit medical proof but after calling 111 it was madeclear that for someone like me, getting proof was not feasible. So for practical purposes, the promise of hardship supportturned out to be an empty one: Deliveroo did not pay out. I have since found out that many other delivery and driver companies have promised sickness support to their workers but failed to deliver. With no real rights and protections for gig economy workers like me, it’s going to get harder and harder for people who should self-isolate to make the right choice. In the end I was lucky to be able to rely on friends and family for help with essentials, but have still had to cut back on a lot of basics.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said that workers on zero-hours contracts are eligible for help under the job retention scheme. But that doesn’t apply to people like me because we’re not on contract. So he basically said I have to keep on waiting. That is not good enough. I can’t feed my family on promises from the chancellor, I need certainty and I need cash.Last week the government classified couriers as key workers. The job we do is vital to the protection of public health, whether we’re delivering food or medical supplies. Every day of waiting could cost lives. That’s why the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain  is taking legal action against the government for failing to protect precarious workers like me.And it’s not just the couriers. It’s the cleaners, the minicab drivers, the care workers, and many others who are all on the frontline, every day. We’ve been campaigning for years to win recognition of our basic employment rights. It shouldn’t be such a struggle to rectify this injustice, especially during a pandemic with so many thousands of lives hanging in the balance.As long as self-isolation is a privilege for those who can afford it, there is a danger that workers will turn up for a shift when they shouldn’t, with all that risks that entails. It’s clear that many gig-economy employers won’t give sufficient priority to public health. The government says it will stand behind businesses – but how many people have to die before they finally step up and stand behind us too?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/497e22d219e74cc6d220a2d317addb662232d0dc/0_425_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa982fb65ec1b4938a01646f22f72879","title":"pandemic britains self employed ignored","story":"During the coronavirus pandemic, the self-employed have been the first to lose work and the last to get help. Max, an events photographer I spoke to, told me that he found out he had lost a job via Twitter. His client didn’t even bother to contact him. Ben, a stand-up comedian with three children, said he had lost £5,000 worth of work in two days. The small businesses that hire many of these freelancers are either too scared to spend money (and the self-employed are the easiest to let go, since they have so few rights), or they simply can’t afford to retain staff who aren’t supported by the government’s measures. One small business owner, Allison, told me she took a flight to New York and in the time between her departure and arrival, all of her income had evaporated, meaning she could no longer afford to pay anyone. “While my employees have been given help, my self-employed workers have been thrown to the wolves,” she said.This intolerable situation is, predictably, causing a mental health crisis. Many of the people I spoke to said their anxiety was “through the roof”. Some talked of pretending everything was OK so as not to alarm their children – others were close to tears and felt their careers were over. Many workers, particularly those in the arts, tourism and events sectors, had been preparing for increased business over the summer months and had already bought stock and equipment in advance, only to find that their entire livelihoods had dried up in a matter of days. Many had also been hit by the government’s derisory offer for renters (which effectively amounts to pausing evictions for three months). Their lives were collapsing, but they were being ignored.On Tuesday, Sunak said the delay in supporting the self-employed was for “genuine practical and principled reasons”, one of these being that some self-employed people might end up making more money as a result of the pandemic. Leaving aside the absurd idea that destitute self-employed people might prefer to remain that way in case others inadvertently do well, the truth is there aren’t any practical reasons why the government can’t start supporting the self-employed today.As Will Stronge, co-director of Autonomy, puts it: “There are existing institutions and mechanisms already in place that hold the bank details of self-employed workers across the country. The practicalities of paying these workers should not be an issue the government needs to explain precisely what the problem is and why it isn’t acting urgently to prevent a significant chunk of the labour force from suffering hardship.”For the sake of millions of self-employed people our colleagues, friends, neighbours and family members, the government needs to rush through an urgent package of support today. And then, as the dust settles on the coronavirus pandemic, we need to start asking what kind of economy allows so many people to spend their lives living so close to poverty.• Ellie Mae O’Hagan is a journalist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c64aa984044dfec0a6dca10f06ace89f479b501f/0_175_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bfcb8e7c7fe8f3d02d62aed012c32c9","title":"social distancing government covid 19","story":"In the Covid-19 crisis, iniduals must act responsibly. But weak and complacent messaging has had predictable results Backed into a corner, Boris Johnson has announced an unprecedented lockdown on Britain’s public life. The solemn tone of last night’s address carried the heavy weight of reluctance. For days, the government’s messaging has been that the public were failing to practice social distancing of their own accord, with sources saying there was “total fury” across Westminster over people flouting orders and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, accusing those still gathering of being “very selfish”.You don’t have to be too cynical to feel that this language sounds a lot like the government preparing to play its get out of jail card, whereby it offers vague and unenforceable “advice”, points disapprovingly to those ignoring it, and is then free to shift blame for the inevitable rise in coronavirus cases on to the public.From the beginning, the government’s communications strategy has bordered on lethal complacency. It told the public its plan was “herd immunity”, which required many to catch the virus, only to backtrack as if it had never said it. Johnson only closed pubs and restaurants at the weekend, having previously offered social distancing guidance that never cut through. Until Tuesday’s address, ministers have used paywalled articles and a 5pm briefing to get information across, rather than the blanket national TV ads and billboards you would expect. It has even emerged that the government can’t send advice on coronavirus directly to Britons’ mobile phones because it repeatedly ignored its own findings that an emergency messaging system could help in times of crisis. Instead, it had to rely on mobile network operators.The result has been all too predictable. People in the UK have flocked to seaside towns and beauty spots in recent days as many families appeared to view schools closing as an opportunity for an early Easter holiday. Parks were filled with groups of friends obliviously meeting up in the sunshine. New data confirms the UK has been lagging behind other countries in measures such as cutting down our restaurant visits and working at home.The social distancing shambles has led to some uncomfortable “punching down”, such as high-profile online accounts mocking people for queuing at supermarkets. But a focus on blaming the public risks letting the government – the party with power, resources and reach – off the hook. There is a middle ground, however. It is possible to think adults have a personal responsibility to consider their high-risk neighbours while believing the government has heavily influenced their failure to do so by poor communication and slow action.The theme of personal responsibility often becomes toxic when used politically – whether it’s claiming that “the poor wouldn’t need food banks if only they budgeted properly”, or “the long-term sick would get off benefits if they had enough motivation”. But you don’t have to be a libertarian to understand that inidual behaviour is key in a pandemic, or to believe that we have a duty to think of each other. While political structures strongly determine our choices, free will still means we hold some responsibility for them. To put it another way: leisure venues being open for so long in the UK was a psychological nudge that gave many people “permission” to still use them – but it was still up to each of us if we chose a fun outing with mates over listening to calls to protect someone else’s life. An 18-year-old with underlying health problems died this weekend. I wonder how many nights out at the pub they’ll miss out on.Public behaviour in the light of Johnson’s hands-off approach could be compared to smoking, in that smokers were well aware of the risk of cancer but it took legislative action to discourage many of them. But it’s actually more like passive smoking: continuing to socialise in the face of coronavirus, and the state refusing to strongly step in, didn’t just endanger iniduals themselves, but other people at higher risk. Perhaps instead of photos of damaged lungs on fag packets, the government should be running ads of grandmas in ICU gasping for air. If this is hard to hear, it should be. People are dying. People are trapped inside their homes afraid. Others have enjoyed a day trip to the beach.For years, Britain’s political culture has stoked a dog-eat-dog inidualism, just as it has cast doubt on experts. We should not be shocked that those particular chickens are now coming home to roost. The government is finally introducing the state-led intervention this pandemic requires. But in the coming weeks values, as well as the law, are going to be what helps us get through this. A recognition that we are all more interconnected than appeared to be case. That inidual want doesn’t trump community need. That disabled and older people’s lives are worth protecting. Some things should not need legislation.• Frances Ryan is a  columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5471cd5414a097d233dfeb5d11ff6a837b64771b/0_473_6401_3841/master/6401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b51a4b46b37e7a0edfa3a56f5f728aa4","title":"arts workers what effect has coronavirus had on your job","story":"As redundancies are suddenly made across arts venues forced to close their doors, we want to hear from youAs the UK government introduces measures to protect workers who will lose earnings during the coronavirus, amid calls to introduce similar measures for the self-employed, there are reports of employers letting staff go with little or no notice.The arts sector is particularly at risk: cinemas, concert venues, theatres and galleries have all been closed.

The words hard and daunting crop up frequently as she describes her journey from a Midlands comprehensive, then sixth-form college, to one of the most elite universities in the world.Oxford has felt “one step removed from me”, she explains. “A friend of a friend had been, but I didn’t have any family reference points so it felt very tough.”Now, about to sit her English finals, Minogue is a testament to one Oxford college’s stunning success in the rebalancing of state and private school Oxbridge entry, one of the most hotly contested issues in public education.More significantly, the majority of those offers come from non-selective state schools and include a higher percentage of disadvantaged pupils, those from BAME backgrounds and from areas with low progression to higher education than the rest of the university. So how have they pulled it off, and why can’t others?According to Mansfield’s new principal, Helen Mountfield, they could. Mountfield is a barrister and former south London comprehensive schoolgirl – although from a middle-class professional family – who made it to one of the most exclusive colleges, Magdalen, in the 1980s.She believes Mansfield’s success, whereby the college has moved steadily up the Oxford Norrington table from bottom in 2007 to fifth this year, is down to its longstanding outreach work, its approach of putting each applicant’s achievements in context and the college’s “authentic” culture.“My answer to the social engineering point is that we don’t believe we are taking less clever people to make up for disadvantage. We are looking for the cleverest people from a pool where everyone is clever. We want the people who will walk out of the door as the finished article, not those who will walk in the door as the finished article,” she says.The college employs two expert access officers and makes a determined effort to present itself as a place that is open the website’s headline reads: “Open, Friendly, Welcoming. Mansfield has the highest state sector intake of Oxford”.“Applicants don’t have to worry about being in a cultural minority here, or whether they would fit in,” says Mountfield. “There isn’t really a cultural minority here. People come from all over and with different backgrounds.”The college also takes a painstaking approach to analysis of contextual data such as progression rates to university and levels of disadvantage in different parts of the country, GCSE and A-level results and free school meals (FSM) eligibility of each applicant’s school and whether they are care leavers.Perhaps the most contentious element of the Oxbridge admissions is the interview. A recent report from the Sutton Trust showed that six private schools and two state sixth-forms accounted for more Oxbridge offers than 3,000 other state schools and credited the availability of expert advice and preparation for that success.Mansfield College’s senior admissions tutor, Lucinda Rumsey, recounts one applicant explaining that the only interview she had experienced before coming to Mansfield was at Greggs bakery. She got in and graduated with a 2:1. Rumsey believes the interview process is a powerful tool for equalising access. “The important thing for selection is good pre-interview information, prior qualifications and a reference from a teacher who knows the student well and has seen them develop. Then we are trying to work out if candidates have aptitude for a particular subject and will thrive at it.“The interview helps us to do some nuanced work around that. Tutors as subject specialists are in a good position to assess potential. Almost all the applicants we get are well-qualified, and we have to make fine distinctions.“If candidates start out very well prepared by their school for interview, we try to see past that. If they have come from a school that rarely sends applicants to Oxford and have had no preparation, we want to see past that as well.“Some candidates can be inflexible in their thinking if we take them off their comfortable ground. Interviews aren’t only about getting a right answer but engaging with what is asked and thinking through a problem that it is difficult and unfamiliar.”The colleges’ access officer, Sara Harb, whose family moved to the UK from Jordan when she was five, recently graduated with a first in history after coming to Mansfield from an inner London comprehensive.“There were people at my school saying, ‘people from this school don’t go to Oxford’ but as soon as I got here, I realised everyone seemed friendly and normal and not geniuses or very posh,” she explains.“People from less well-performing schools often have to work really hard to get the grades and my school didn’t have the right interview prep but the tutors made me feel settled. I felt I was being challenged in an academic and friendly way rather than being set up to get caught out.”“In these Covid-19 times we see the starkly different home circumstances of students. We have students who are alienated from families, students who have been carers, share rooms with siblings, don’t have a desk or wifi at home,” she adds.“For us the next step is giving students access to equal chances after they leave, social capital as well as educational capital, so networks, grants for internships.”Dan Hall, a third-year undergraduate in PPE from a state school in Manchester, agrees that different education backgrounds also show up after admission.“For me it was ‘wow I am here, got to make the most of the experience’ rather than focus on career stuff. It is only later on that you realise you are behind the curve because they have been on a different path from the start.”Rumsey says there is a lot more pride in the state school access issue across the university, with conversations focusing more on the impact of privilege than disadvantage.“There has been a presumption in the past that the latter group are riskier. But once you have made this shift, and seen the impact, you know that isn’t true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb4fd943ded225b3ad0c325932e355a7cbd7b3f/96_381_4098_2459/master/4098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4e6fba11b3d93c9e7088b26d63a7660","title":"peregrine falcon drama at salisbury cathedral with a new egg and a lost bird","story":"A female peregrine has been spotted on a balcony nest, but Sally, star of Springwatch, hasn’t been seenThe rollercoaster saga of the Salisbury Cathedral peregrine falcons is continuing this spring, with one bird protecting an egg on a balcony of the great building but another missing in action.A female that has been visiting the balcony regularly in recent weeks has laid one egg and can be viewed hunkering down on the nest via a cathedral webcam.Less cheerfully, a GPS tracking device that was attached to a bird, known as Sally, that used to nest at the cathedral has stopped giving out its signal. It could be that the device has stopped working or that, sadly, Sally is no more.Phil Sheldrake, species recovery officer with the RSPB, said: “It’s great that we have an egg – and quite a bit earlier than last year.”The female on the nest does not have an identity ring, meaning that it is not known if she is the same one that produced four eggs last year, but Sheldrake said it was highly likely that it was the same bird.“Peregrines do not like to be overlooked,” he said. “Salisbury Cathedral sticks out like a sore thumb above the rolling countryside. It’s like a five-star hotel for them.”There are generally three or four eggs in a clutch and incubation doesn’t start until the last egg is laid. Once that has happened, the female – and male - will sit on the nest at intervals to keep eggs warm. Incubation lasts 29-32 days, so if all goes well, chicks should appear in early May.Meanwhile, the tracker attached to Sally, who became a television star after featuring on BBC’s Springwatch in 2017, last pinpointed her on 3 November 2019 above the village of Coombe Bissett, three miles from Salisbury – but no signal has been picked up since.Sheldrake said: “We don’t know if she’s alive or whether the tracker has simply stopped working. We haven’t seen her on the cameras at the cathedral and it’s quite possible the tracking device has just stopped working after nearly three years.“She is possibly 10 now, and whilst the oldest peregrine known was at least 24, the average life is around 10.” The tracker works on solar power, so if Sally has died it would probably not receive enough light to carry on working.Salisbury Cathedral has a historic bond with peregrines, which was broken in the 20th century because of persecution and pesticides. The first pair to breed in modern times arrived in 2014. The birds have done well there since then, apart from in 2018 when no eggs were laid following an unholy scrap between Sally and an unringed female."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52447fda29673449929ca47fb92968679ab8843a/0_264_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e43748a00c518e40854eac30265b96","title":"twin ring tailed lemurs born at chester zoo","story":"Numbers of endangered primate thought to have shrunk by half in the last 36 yearsTwin ring-tailed lemurs have been born at a UK zoo.The endangered primates were born to mother Fiona and father Dog at Chester zoo on 2 March and have just begun to venture outside.Mike Jordan, director of animals and plant collections at the zoo, said: “Ring-tailed lemurs are the one of the planet’s highest primate conservation priorities, so we’re absolutely thrilled to see two tiny babies born into the group here at Chester.“Wonderfully, youngsters are born just like miniature adults and already have all of their fur markings, including their iconic black and white tails, which they use to help identify one another.”The twins are 15cm (6in) tall and weigh just a few hundred grams, described as being “no bigger than tennis balls with tails”.Zookeepers have not yet been able to get close enough to determine the sex of the animals, as they will spend the first few months of their lives clinging to and piggybacking on their mother.Lemurs are found in the wild only on the island of Madagascar, where mass deforestation has destroyed much of their natural habitat.Experts believe the population of wild lemurs has decreased by about half in the last 36 years.Jordan said: “It’s sad to consider just how endangered they have become, but the birth of these twins gives a timely boost to the international conservation breeding programme for these fantastically charismatic animals.“In these unsettling times, the arrival of such endangered babies really does help to raise a smile.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/652e1e899e63d526def7ed1bb90e4fb35426be5c/0_8_5929_3559/master/5929.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02d2ebefb8df09c7f612276ce963f42b","title":"melanie c i spent a few years trying not to be sporty spice","story":"The pop star on her years as a raver, her punk rebellion – and her daughter’s fondness for athleisureSportswear has become such a big thing in the past few years and, being Sporty Spice, I’ve really embraced that – but at the Brit awards this year I wanted to take it somewhere else.This dress is from Fila’s springsummer 2020 collection – it’s really grownup, beautiful, red-carpet chic, but with a bit of a sporty twist.

Will the British industry follow suit?Prada is the latest big-name fashion brand to turn its production lines, usually focused on elegant blazers and blouses, to meet needs arising from the coronavirus crisis. Yesterday it said it would produce 110,000 masks by 6 April, while Gucci has said it will make more than 1m and Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga – both of which, like Gucci, are owned by Kering – will also begin manufacturing them.High-street brands are similarly shifting their focus. Last week, Spanish-owned Zara pledged to produce surgical masks, saying it had already donated 10,000 masks and a further 300,000 were due to be sent by the end of this week. Over the weekend, H\u0026ampM Group said it would be rearranging its supply chain to produce protective equipment for hospitals and healthcare workers.It is hoped that brands might soon follow suit in the UK, with the British Fashion Council the not-for-profit organisation that promotes British design globally, last week asking those with “production capacity” to help with shortages. NHS workers in the UK have been speaking out against shortages of protective gear, with London paramedics being rationed to one face mask between two, despite the under-fire UK health secretary Matt Hancock saying yesterday that he had ordered “millions of masks”.The move to make masks follows on from LVMH’s announcement, earlier this month, that it would convert three of its factories, which usually manufacture perfumes under labels such as Givenchy and Guerlain, to the production of hand sanitiser.Donatella Versace last week pledged more than $200,000 to the intensive care unit of Milan’s San Raffaele hospital Mayhoola, the parent company of Valentino and Balmain, yesterday pledged $2m to the coronavirus effort Giorgio Armani donated $1.4m to four of Italy’s busiest hospitals and the chief executive of Gucci, Marco Bizzarri, gave $100,000 to hospitals in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, another of the hardest hit areas of the country. Money from a crowd-funding project promoted by the fashion influencer Chiara Ferragni brought in more than €4m for a new intensive care ward Milan’s San Raffaele hospital.So far, in the UK, altruistic fashion initiatives have been on a much smaller scale, with social enterprises launching T-shirts emblazoned with slogans from “Isolate, Just Do It” to raise money for the food bank network Trussell Trust, to “National Hero Service” to raise money for the NHS. The London-based sustainable designer Phoebe English announced last week that she would be making face masks for medical professionals. While stores are shut, the shoe brand Kurt Geiger is asking its 2,500 staff to volunteer in local communities and has partnered with Age UK to help – all staff, apart from the company’s CEO, will continue to be paid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a2dbd636cc68ed9344a5a137b413a4bf125135/313_245_1435_861/master/1435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c53bbfef153a7068e574e129a2784b5","title":"us box office zero revenue first time ever coronavirus the invisible man","story":"Shutdown of cinemas hits film industry hard – but Onwards reportedly earns $71,000, mostly from drive-insThe US box office has recorded zero revenue for the first time in history after the country’s near total cinema shutdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Data agency Comscore did not issue their weekly report after Hollywood’s major distributors, led by Disney, declined to issue any figures.According to Comscore’s senior media analyst, Paul Dergarabedian, the only comparable occasion was in the immediate aftermath of the Northridge earthquake in 1994, which hampered collection of data, but its commercial effects were limited to California. With major chains such as Regal and AMC shutting down last week, the halting of cinema income is far more profound.Even so, some films are reporting revenue. The box office leader, according to Box Office Mojo, is the midlife-crisis comedy Phoenix, Oregon, which has taken $3,842 from 17 screens. However, this is the outcome of a streaming partnership with inidual cinemas, in which audiences can watch the film at home with a box-office split with a nominated venue. The film tweeted a tongue-in-cheek message congratulating itself on becoming the “lowest-grossing #1 film of all time”.According to Deadline, however, the latest DisneyPixar film Onward is playing at 135 locations and grossed $71,000, while horror film The Invisible Man has taken $64,000 from 111 venues. This appears to have mostly accrued from drive-in cinemas, with the Glendale Drive-In in Glendale, Arizona becoming Onward’s biggest-earning venue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c8c263cf487db9dc36fa4a34ce0cb4e7c183755/0_260_1340_804/master/1340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=966929e28224cb394616880d5850841f","title":"what to watch self isolating film tv youtube tennis","story":"Self-isolation offers a chance to catch up on the classics – but that requires a calm it’s currently hard to muster. In the first of a new series, one writer reveals the truth about their coronavirus viewing habitsLast week, the BFI released a list of the films streaming on Netflix and Amazon Prime. It’s terrific. It contains several movies I’ve always wanted to see (Adelheid, Images) and several I love and want to see again (The Green Ray, Orphée). The weekend was beckoning and the world appeared to be ending. I drafted a timetable of all the great films I would watch.Now it is Monday and the timetable is in ruins – which is to say that I didn’t watch a single film. What I watched was the BBC news, which is playing as a real-time adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, The Stand. What I watched was five episodes of the French sitcom Call My Agent, all of which I had seen before. What I watched was a Netflix documentary about a demented cowboy who ran a tiger park in Oklahoma. What I watched was the first half of The Wizard of Oz with my five-year-old son, just before he went to bed. Happily, he seems to have liked it saying: “The only thing I really, really hate are the songs.”Naturally, Covid-19 is partly to blame. If you take a random person who is exhausted, anxious and confused, and offer them a choice between watching a cherished classic from their childhood or the full seven hours of Béla Tarr’s Sátántangó, they’ll most likely plump for the least forbidding option. Even so, I suspect that our current predicament has merely accelerated a trend. I used to be altogether more adventurous in my viewing habits. In my 20s and 30s I’d always have gone for the Béla Tarr, if only to boast to people about how I was the sort of person who would always go for the Béla Tarr. Since then I’ve been backsliding, or maybe lightening up. And, as of this past fortnight, I’m a complete MOR sap. These days it’s as much as I can do to focus on anything that a) I haven’t already seen and b) comes in under two hours.What am I really watching? Mostly, I’m opting for the lowest form of escapism. As a kind of comfort blanket, I’ll watch YouTube videos of old celebrity interviews: John Lennon on Dick Cavett and Richard Burton on Parky.Occasionally I’ll watch antique tennis matches, too. Wilander versus McEnroe at the 1985 US Open. Becker versus Lendl at the 1988 Masters.Mostly these are matches I remember watching, live on telly, as a kid. Sometimes they are matches where I can remember which player hit which shot on which break point in the fifth set. Which makes it rather sad perhaps a little creepy, too. But you don’t need a psychiatrist to explain the appeal of these videos. There’s something reassuring about watching a drama unfold and knowing how it ends.Next weekend, fingers crossed, we’ll have another stab at the BFI list. But, for the time being, let’s not beat ourselves up about taking the low road, about choosing the trashiest option or the nostalgic frippery. Whatever gets you through the night, as John Lennon once said, possibly to Dick Cavett. Besides, Call My Agent is holding up nicely on the second viewing, and the tiger zoo documentary is perfectly entertaining. (Although, wait, how many episodes? Surely that’s stretching the whole thing very thin.) Plus there’s always the second half of The Wizard of Oz still to get through.In Preston Sturges’s Depression-era satire Sullivan’s Travels, a successful director of Hollywood comedies dreams of making a harsh, social-realist masterpiece only to realise that the world desperately needs to laugh, particularly when it’s laid out flat on its arse. That sounds about right it’s a solid thesis right now.So by all means watch dark, difficult films during dark, difficult times. But maybe balance them out with something lighter as well. I like the story of how, after Ingmar Bergman died, it was found that his film library contained VHS copies of Die Hard, The Blues Brothers and Romancing the Stone. I like it because it shows another side to the man, and perhaps points the way to a deeper psychological truth. Sometimes even Bergman needed a break from Bergman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b445db160d98b21ba3af023fa36a25c13c70e6f/63_1551_3379_2025/master/3379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaae52de40b782375874a222dab3ef06","title":"is reheated rice safe to eat","story":"So long as you store it properly, there’s no reason to be afraid of reheating cooked rice. It’s the building block for many a great dishCan you explain the dos and don’ts of cooked rice? I thought it was dangerous to eat unless it’s chilled straight after cooking, but I know people who ignore this with apparent impunity.Tiff, Bath, SomersetCan reheated cooked rice cause food poisoning? Yes, is the straight answer – though it’s not usually poor reheating skills that are to blame, but bad storage practices. As food scientist extraordinaire Harold McGee notes in his epic tome On Food \u0026amp Cooking, “Raw rice almost always carries dormant spores of the bacterium Bacillus cereus, which produces powerful gastrointestinal toxins.” These, in turn, can cause unpleasantness, though thankfully only a relatively mild dose compared with other forms of food poisoning.Those spores can even survive the cooking process, so the longer rice is kept at room temperature afterwards, the more likely bacteria are to thrive. Which is one reason, among many, to be thankful that those pea and sweetcorn-flecked rice salads so beloved of 20th-century buffets are rarely seen these days. To prevent bacterial growth, McGee advises chilling any cooked grains within four hours, though the NHS suggests even greater caution, saying to cool it down as fast as possible and get it in the fridge inside an hour it also recommends binning cooked rice after 24 hours, never to reheat it more than once and to make sure it’s piping hot all the way through, which McGee, in typically thorough fashion, sets at 73C or above.All that said, many wonderful dishes, from Asian fried rice to Indian rice pakora and Italian arancini, rely on cooked rice as their starting point, so please don’t be too put off, Tiff. As Ben Curtis, head chef at Thai restaurant Smoking Goat in London, says: “To make good fried rice, you need to start with ‘old’ cooked rice.” To meet food safety requirements, Curtis chills his rice to below 5C within 90 minutes of cooking, but once you’ve ticked that safety box, he says, the next day the fried rice world is your oyster.As noted in this column before, the secret to great fried rice is a well-seasoned wok. “The aroma, or ‘breath’, of the wok lends the rice a slight char and smokiness,” Curtis explains. “And keep the wok very hot throughout, to avoid ending up with something upsettingly claggy.” Don’t be shy with the fat or oil, either: “You need a decent amount to make sure you fry the rice, rather than sweat it.” Hot and quick are key here. The Chinese tend to keep additional flavourings to a mimimum, but Thais have no such qualms, Curtis says. He adds lardo for richness – “You can get something similar at home with salted chunks of belly fat or lardons” – and tempers the fatty pork with a nam prik chilli relish, sweet fried onions, garlic, Turkish green peppers and fish sauce. “The more layers of spice, aroma and texture you have, the better.” (He adds that Thais also love fermenting fish or pork in sticky rice by leaving it somewhere humid and warm before frying, but wouldn’t recommend trying the same unless you really know what you’re doing.)As for arancini, the rice may be a different variety, but the same food hygiene standards apply to arborio and carnaroli as to long-grain, says Francesco Mazzei, who runs the kitchens at Sartoria, Fiume and Radici, all in London. “Risotto is a north Italian dish, anyway. Down south, where I’m from, you hardly see it anywhere. We make riso, not risotto, and the rice tends to be boiled from scratch, often in just water with a little saffron, though I prefer stock.”There’s a lot more to cooked riso than arancini, too, Mazzei adds. “We use it in all sorts, from croquettes to stuffed peppers to sartu di riso, a kind-of-lasagne pie made with layers of vegetables, meat and rice instead of pasta.” Mind you, in his family the appearance of rice at the table was usually bad news: “Whenever Mum made rice, we all knew it meant someone was ill. Though how rice with lentils can cure anyone is still a mystery – it’s so boring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443aee7106d5e94968d0f8a29adcb46d8846d3ef/0_51_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6132ec0aeee80862b60037f00c820214","title":"back of the pantry five australian chefs share their storeroom recipes","story":"From Kylie Kwong’s fried rice to Matt Moran’s risoni chicken soup, using up the ingredients that have been hiding in your larder doesn’t have to be dullWhen you’re trying to keep within a budget, avoid another run to the supermarket, or stave off the boredom of being cooped up indoors, it’s a great time to start using up the ingredients that have been hiding in the back of your pantry for months.It’s about using what you have to cook a flavoursome and erse range of foods with basic pantry supplies.These recipes are also adaptable to work with whatever you currently have on your shelves at home.

Almost five years ago Jodie Taylor, Lucy Bronze and their fellow Lionesses grasped it for just long enough to transform not only their own lives but the entire landscape of women’s football in England.The repercussions would prove so far-reaching that many of those of us present as extras – the journalists and fans in the background behind the central stage – can still feel Canada’s reassuringly strong late June sun beating down on our forearms during the walk to BC Place.The thermometer hit 25C (77F) as kick-off approached and Vancouver was arguably at its most beautiful. A long goal-kick away from the stadium, the Pacific Ocean looked azure and, dominating the skyline, the North Shore Mountains afforded the city a stunning frame.Even the shocking number of rough sleepers seemed, temporarily, to have vanished from the seedier streets.Outside the ground, the statue of Terry Fox, a famous Canadian athlete turned heroic cancer research fundraiser, was dressed in a familiar-looking outsize red-and-white-striped shirt emblazoned with the message “SAFC on tour”.It represented both a nod to the north-east-bred nucleus of the England squad, who had graduated from Sunderland Ladies, and a message to John Herdman, Canada’s charismatic Consett-born, Newcastle United-adoring manager. Collisions between globalism and parochialism rarely feel as joyous.Once inside BC Place, the first view of the brilliantly sun-washed pitch and stands packed with 54,000 fans, many waving red and white Canadian flags embossed with the maple leaf was breathtaking. In an instant, that national symbol morphed from merely an attractive image adorning the tailfins of Air Canada’s fleet to the source of an incredibly powerful patriotism being newly applied to the country’s female football team.The fiercely partisan noise was ear-splitting and the tension similarly tangible. The England manager, Mark Sampson, from a part of Cardiff with certain similarities to Consett, was good friends with Herdman. Bright young coaches, big on psychology and tactical intrigue, they shared a penchant for wearing tight white shirts and were nothing like as brash as they could sometimes seem.Publicly, though, it was very different. A gloriously edgy off-pitch preamble had seen Sampson demand refereeing protection against a side he termed the tournament’s “most aggressive”. Herdman told his players to “give England hell”.Jodie Taylor remained undaunted. Only nine weeks earlier the electric-heeled striker blessed with fabulously elusive movement had undergone knee surgery expected to sideline her for months but here she was seizing on Lauren Sesselman’s ghastly defensive mistake and surging towards goal. Taylor’s acceleration swept her past one marker and then another before she shot unerringly into a bottom corner. BC Place fell eerily silent.Bronze had begun the tournament in relative anonymity but, by now, opponents knew she was special. Herdman shook his head and smiled wryly as the right-back met Fara Williams’s long free-kick with her head to double England’s advantage.Cue urgent touchline semaphore from Herdman and a tactical change involving the assured Kadeisha Buchanan starting to play out smoothly from the back. Sampson’s tightened body language suggested half-time could not arrive swiftly enough but, before it did, Christine Sinclair, Canada’s most important forward, scored.Karen Bardsley, England’s goalkeeper, spilled a routine cross and Sinclair needed no invitation to direct the rebound home. It really felt BC Place shook as it emitted a roar so loud it must have been audible in the United States.The second half seemed an eternity but a wonderful central defensive performance from Steph Houghton – one goalline clearance lingers in the memory – not only propelled England into a first World Cup semi-final but sparked an enduring flame fuelling the domestic game’s still burgeoning growth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a600d23641e3f9aded346f3dd58310acf539f3/0_201_4777_2867/master/4777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e935a8663f27d8a26cb04bfc4cfad85","title":"england v germany euro 96 semi final live","story":"6 min Gazza – come on, we’re all friends here – beats Helmer and Sammer on the right edge of the area with some lovely footwork, but his cross to Platt is overhit. 5 min Gascoigne takes a blundering shortcut through the back of Sammer, an overzealous rather than malicious tackle.

It was the simplest goal, the old Arsenal near-post routine, but with Tony Adams playing the role of Steve Bould. Gascoigne’s flighted corner skimmed off his head at the near post, and the unmarked Shearer – the unmarked Shearer! - headed it through the legs of Kopke. It’s his fifth goal of the tournament. There was nothing Kopke could do about that – but he was still at fault for the goal, as it was his typically ostentatious punch that led to the corner. Who cares: England are ahead!2 min: Kopke saves from Ince! Pearce’s deep cross from the left is headed out by Ziege and bounces up towards Ince, 35 yards from goal. He chests the ball up in the air, runs onto it and pings a dipping volley that is punched over the bar by the flying Kopke. It was a fairly straightforward save – most keepers would have caught it – but a cracking effort nonetheless. And it’s got the crowd going again, which is just what England wanted.1 min Germany kick off, from left to right as we watch on the office TV. Whatever happens in the next couple of hours will live with us until we’re old and doddery.“As regards schoolboy humour evinced from a German surname,” says Ian Copestake, “the English should take a hard look at their goalkeeper before casting nasturtiums.”“Let’s hope there is now respect for the German anthem,” says Barry Davies, who hasn’t even finished his sentence when the boos start. It’s not as bad as I feared - a few whistles rather than a wall of wewonthewar noise - but it’s still a bit depressing. “Those who felt it necessary to whistle,” says Davies, “we can leave to their own ignorance.”The players stroll onto the field, ready for the anthems. England’s is to be sung by 80s crooner Paul Young... whose microphone isn’t working. Not that it matters: most of the studio are belting it out, Tony Adams with particular gusto.England have four players on a yellow card: Adams, Southgate, Shearer and Sheringham. Germany have five: Moller, Sammer, Reuter, Ziege, Kuntz.“Before your anglophone readers get too carried away with Kuntz,” says Peter Oh. “The pronunciation of the German forward’s name is actually more like that of American thriller novelist Dean Koontz than the ubiquitous British insult. Sorry to ruin it for everyone. By the way, Koontz launched a new book last year (1995) called Intensity. No, it is not about Stuart Pearce trying to get in his German opponents’ heads.”Des Lynam handed over to Barry Davies for the build-up about 10 minutes. Davies has said almost nothing. He’s just letting the atmosphere sing for itself: first Three Lions, then You’ll Never Walk Alone and now, erm, We Will Rock You. There really is an exultant atmosphere at Wembley. The Beeb have a heavyweight punditry panel. Jimmy Hill, who has his England bowtie on, Ruud Gullit and Alan Hansen. “I think it’s 5050,” says Hill, and on balance I’d agree. Two minutes ago I was 100 per cent sure England would lose. Now I’m 100 per cent sure they’ll win. It’s coming home! Possibly.The BBC coverage, pushed back because of extra time in the Czech Republic, is underway. “Hello again, glad you’ve tuned in,” says Des. “You’ve obviously heard there’s a football match on tonight.” “Hi Rob,” says Niall Mullen. “Small point but I wonder if England will miss Redknapp. He looked really calm \u0026amp composed (not to mention preternaturally handsome) when he came on against Scotland. I’m not sure if England have anyone else with that sort of control in midfield. Anyway what a glorious evening for football and come on Germany (unless Fowler gets a run).”Yeah, had he been fit I think he’d have started ahead of Platt tonight, and against Spain as well. He’s another one, like Phil Neville, whose time will come.Germany are technically the home side, so England will be playing in their change strip tonight: it’s indigo blue, according to Umbro, but it looks grey to everyone else. I’m not even going to attempt to describe David Seaman’s goalkeeping top.First things first: it wasn’t a bluff, there’s no Jurgen Klinsmann for Germany. That’s an almighty boost to England.Right, Terry Venables makes one change from the win over Spain. Paul Ince, who was missed so badly on Saturday, returns from suspension to replace the newly suspended Gary Neville. The only slight surprise is the inclusion of David Platt ahead of Phil Neville, who most expected to be chosen to replace his brother. That means England will play with three rather than four at the back. Venables has obviously decided that this game is too big for a 19-year-old, even one as precocious as Neville. But his time will come on the evidence of the last six months, he’s going to be a superstar. The word from Wembley is that Klinsmann has bugger all chance of coming off the bench, even though he will sit among the German substitutes. His replacement is the 33-year-old Stefan Kuntz, who plays for Besiktas in Turkey – not, as some of you have suggested, for Nominative Determinism FC. Kuntz will play up front of his own. Fredi Bobic, the other striker who started on Sunday, is also injured. The midfielder Steffen Freund comes in for him. Germany have been ravaged by injuries, and two of their seven available substitutes are reserve goalkeepers.The Czech Republic are in the Euro 96 final! Their fairytale will continue at Wembley on Sunday! They’ve just beaten France 6-5 on penalties at Old Trafford after a forgettable 0-0 draw. Miroslav Kadlec roofed the winning penalty after Reynald Pedros’s tame penalty was saved. Poor bloke. The Czech Republic are one game away from an astonishing success. But you can’t escape the fact that England would be happy to play them in the final.It was always going to come to this. Come on, did you really think football would be allowed to come home without first getting past the Germans? They’re the Keyser Soze of world football: nine of the last 12 major tournaments involving European teams have been won by the Germans or the team that put them out. And it’ll probably be 10 out of 13 come Sunday evening.Whoever wins at Wembley will go into the final as decent favourites against either France or the Czech Republic. That game is heading for a penalty shoot-out: it’s 0-0 at Old Trafford with a few minutes of extra-time remaining. I was going to say it’s been a stinker, but that would be overly generous.As in 1990, when a bereft Argentina waited in the final for the winners of England and West Germany, this feels like more than a semi-final. England and Germany have been the two best teams in the tournament, even allowing for England’s occasionally obscene good fortune against Spain on Saturday. That win added to an already overwhelming sense of destiny – and, if we’re being honest, slightly dangerous giddiness - up and down the country.There are two ways of looking at this Germany side. The first is that they are Germany, and Euro 96 was fun while it lasted. The second is that, as German sides go, they aren’t that scary. Their captain Jurgen Klinsmann is a big doubt after limping off with a calf injury against Croatia – we’ll have team news shortly – and, for all the brilliance of Andreas Moller and especially the sweeper Matthias Sammer, they aren’t a patch on the awesome power team that won Italia 90. You could have a good pub braw- sorry, debate about whether England’s class of 96 are better than the boys of 1990. This team has one undeniable edge: home advantage. The world has changed a lot since 1966, and upper lips are nowhere near as stiff as they once were. The atmosphere at Wembley tonight will be like nothing we’ve heard before.The euphoria of the last 10 days is such that nobody seems to have considered the possibility England might not win tonight. Nobody is ready for the party to end. Nobody wants to stop fakkin shoutin’ lager, lager, lager. This country is certainly going to have an almighty hangover tomorrow. But let’s be clear about this: there are hangovers, and hangovers. What kind is this to be?Kick off is at 7.30pm on 26 June 1996 (and 24 March 2020)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9561c8b0baafb8f85f53b5623547913fbeba1f8/103_2139_762_457/master/762.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=53c1f12bc7a118a4d881ce072ed54bfd","title":"the first time my baby smiled at me it blew my mind the power of a smile","story":"From the struggling new parent to the coma patient, here are the tiny moments of joy that mean everything. Warning: you may cryIt only takes a fraction of a second, but a smile has the power to change everything. And that’s not just for those on the receiving end. According to a 2019 meta-analysis of data from more than 100 studies, smiling makes the person who’s doing it feel happier. From the flash of a grin by a stranger on the bus to the beam of a parent as their children stride through the door, even the most casual smiles have an emotional weight that we feel on an almost cellular level. Here, we chart the power of smiles, from birth to old age.My wife seemed to bond with our daughter immediately. I loved her from the off – I mean, it helped that she looked a lot like me – but it wasn’t in that overwhelming way that I’d hoped for.Mainly, I felt out of my depth. Our baby was so tiny, I was terrified of damaging her. I only got two weeks of paternity leave and because she was breastfeeding I wasn’t as hands-on as I’d hoped. In a way, I was jealous of the bond my wife had with her.But then, when my daughter was two months old, she smiled at me. I experienced this huge rush of love I remember thinking: “I’m your dad …” and it blew my mind. It was the first time I felt properly like a dad. I’m pretty sure I had a tear in my eye. Now our daughter is one and she smiles at me all the time. I still can’t really get over it. And I suppose it helps that she still looks a lot like me.The second time my best friend asked me to be her bridesmaid, I accepted with trepidation. She’d got engaged to her first partner very soon after they met, and afterwards she spent years dealing with the emotional fallout of the breakup.So when she met someone new, I cautioned her to take it slow. Within a few months, though, she announced their engagement. Though I was delighted that she was happy, I feared history would repeat itself.The wedding took a year to plan and my worry wouldn’t subside. I kept my distance from my friend’s new partner. A few times I tried to say that maybe they should slow down or postpone the wedding. “It’s different this time,” she said. But I could see my advice was bothering her.Eventually, I decided it wasn’t a good idea for me to be a bridesmaid. As the big day drew closer, the gap between us seemed to widen and I worried that I’d lost my best friend.The thing that finally convinced me that this time was different was seeing her smile as the marriage was made official. She was so obviously, radiantly happy. I burst into tears and ran to hug her and her new wife. Five years later, they’re more in love than ever and her partner has become one of my best friends too. I think of that as the smile that saved our friendship.Six years ago, I collapsed face first into the porcelain bathroom sink. My bottom teeth came clean (well, bloodily) through my lip. My top teeth splintered like ice on a frozen puddle. It turned out that I was haemorrhaging internally due to a duodenal ulcer it was so bad that I was in danger of a heart attack. An emergency surgery, two blood transfusions and five nights in hospital later, I’d pulled through.But what about the shrapnel formerly known as my teeth? For a few agonising weeks, I waited to find out if there was any hope of turning my stumps into anything even slightly approximating my old smile. “The teeth may die,” the dentist warned.I don’t recall that time very well, I think I was in shock. But I clearly remember the day that I finally got my teeth fixed. I looked in the mirror and felt so relieved to recognise myself again. That smile represented the end of an ordeal. It was the first time I realised how amazing it was that I’d survived.As a palliative care nurse, my patients are often unresponsive. It’s very hard for their families. “Do you think he heard me?” they ask. “Is it worth us talking to them?” The truth is, we can’t know for sure. But I also tell these families the story of how I ended up in my job.The day I decided to apply, I was caring for an elderly patient who’d been unresponsive. I chatted to him but he didn’t seem to hear me. Then his wife – they’d been married for about 60 years – came in and said: “Hello”. The moment he heard her, he smiled.I’ll never forget his amazing smile – I felt incredibly privileged to have witnessed that moment. I immediately put in a request to join the palliative care team and, four years later, I still absolutely love what I do.Read more at tepeuk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371e2e9e97c20b46d5f2e169c365d44bf353a1a9/4989_1431_6696_4019/master/6696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8db95dd48512597d572aa913861f67f","title":"be toothful eight fascinating facts about smiling","story":" We smile when we feel good and we feel good when we grin even more.

Whatever the reasons, one thing is undeniable: it’s just absolutely adorable.The UK cosmetic dentistry industry is worth £2bnAccording to market research group Mintel, we’re so obsessed with having the perfect smile that, each year, as a nation it is estimated that we collectively spend billions on whitening, straightening and generally primping our teeth.

What’s the secret to making you grin?From a big beam to the littlest lift at the corners of your mouth, smiling is infectious in the best possible way. Which is happy news, as new research shows smiling can really improve our mood, spurring a chemical reaction in our brains. As adults, we smile 20-40 times a day – finding joy in small moments that matter is as important as taking care of your teeth and gums. Here, six people share what makes them smile.Hazel Gardiner, 41, floral artist“My dog, Ringo, has made me smile from the moment we met. He was the puppy in a lively litter of goldendoodles who came straight over, desperate to be near me. Ringo is really loving but has some funny quirks. He’s not scared of lightning, but if he sees a luggage trolley he freaks out. He’s also a ball stealer at the park. He can hold three in his mouth, so you need an extra ball to get him to drop them. There have been times when I’ve walked him in the morning and been late for work because he won’t drop someone else’s ball. Now, we take five with us just in case. If I’m working on my laptop, Ringo will nudge my hand with his nose for a cuddle. I’m smiling just thinking about him. I’ve made it my mission to look after my teeth and, as a result, I’m a big smiler.”Sukhi Wahiwala, 45, small business coach“In the Sikh faith we believe that, at a certain point, the roles reverse and children look after their parents. Sadly, a year ago, my mother passed away. Helping my father deal with the loss after 65 years of marriage has been challenging, but positive too. My four children call him Papaji. Because we’re so close, each one of us has been able to be a part of my mum for him. I’m my father’s sounding board. I love listening to stories from his youth. We often talk about my mum’s encyclopedic knowledge and we laugh when I prompt him in the same way she would, bringing his memory back to life.”Nick Gaskell, 35, mortgage adviser“I’ve always struggled with my teeth. I have weak gums from lack of brushing as a child, and my two front teeth cross over. Now I pay serious attention to cleaning my teeth thoroughly and I smile with more confidence. And it shows when I’m doing what I love – gardening. My girlfriend and I recently bought a flat in a mansion block in north London, complete with an overgrown garden. Suddenly, I’m that person who watches gardening tutorials on YouTube, invests in fairy lights and visits the garden centre at the weekend. Now I look out of my kitchen window and see lavender, pieris and my favourite blue hydrangea. There’s a huge sense of achievement.”Christine Brown, 59, housing officer“My oldest daughter had lots of allergies as a child, so I’ve always made everything from scratch since then. Food is a big part of our family life. I find cooking very therapeutic, but there is no greater pleasure in the world than sitting down to eat with my family and seeing their faces light up.”Mariatu Turay-Akar, 42, owner of fashion brand Gitas Portal“I feel so fortunate that my marriage is still, after 20 years and five children, full of love and constant laughter. We’re playful together he makes me feel young. I often forget I’m in my 40s. Remembering when we met brings me joy – though, actually, I wasn’t interested at first. I assumed that we wouldn’t have much in common, but he turned out to be the most witty, charming man, and loves the theatre – just like I do. I smile most when I’m around him.”Keri Tebbit, 32, course development manager“When my four-year-old daughter first saw my braces, she said: ‘Wow!’ like they were the coolest thing ever.

We have a great dynamic and have always had amazing sex. I have a foot fetish and told her about it from the start. She is totally OK with it and we have incorporated it into our sex life here and there. I understand that it is new to her, but I wanted to try some more things with her slowly,  and I asked her if she can sometimes initiate. She has her own quirks and although I don’t quite like some of them, I let her do them anyway and sometimes initiate them because I know it brings her pleasure. But when I talked to her, she said that I made her feel inadequate by asking. She believes that there is no point because it would feel weird for both of us. But if she really liked me, wouldn’t she want to try to leave her comfort zone? Isn’t that what lovers are for?Every couple must navigate the ide between each other’s tastes and idiosyncrasies … and not only regarding sexual behaviour. It is part of the task of deepening bonds between you and learning the rules of compatibility. During this process, the style of negotiation can become more like a power struggle. One or both partners might start feeling coerced, ignored or frustrated. You are still at a trial and error stage. You have not yet discovered each other’s limits, or even your own. Try to be patient because this process always takes time. And it has to be OK for either of you to say: “I’m not comfortable with this.” You will find that your experimentation will sometimes be acceptable to your partner, and at other times you will be shut down. Fortunately, you seem to understand that there will probably have to be quid pro quo in terms of tolerating each other’s “quirks”, in your words – but it is important to remember that there is a fine line between doing something you find distasteful out of love or a sense of duty, and feeling coerced and resentful.

To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.Link said the ATM system was operating at its normal standard and that it was working closely with banks and regulators to ensure cash continued to be available.Some shops are refusing to accept cash during the crisis, demanding that customers pay by card only. Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: “We are concerned this will leave many vulnerable people unable to pay for the basics they need.“Both the government and retailers need to find a way to ensure that the millions of people who rely on cash, and may not have a bank card, can still pay for essentials during this difficult time.”On 23 March, shops and banks agreed to raise the limit for contactless payments, currently £30, to £45, but said some locations might not be ready for the higher limit until 1 April.UK Finance, which represents the big banks, said: “Given the pace at which this change is being rolled out, the new limits will take some time to be introduced across all retailers, including some of those facing additional pressure due to the Covid-19 outbreak.”Mobile phone users can already make contactless payments of more than £30, if the retailer accepts, by holding their phone over the reader and entering their normal card pin on their phone.There is no official limit on the amount a customer can spend when using Apple Pay, but some retailers have their own ceiling. Retailers will face growing pressure to lift minimum card spend rules. Some shops require customers to spend more than £5 to use contactless payments, largely because of the fees they are charged by the payment system operators.Addressing concerns about catching the virus from usingcash, Link said: “Link recommends that people take the same hygiene precautions for contact with surfaces whenever they are using ATMs, spending cash, or making payments - washing your hands as soon as possible and refraining, if possible, from touching the eyes, nose and mouth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbbab06c2add82dbc67ab410a0c9e2b54d62bf70/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60f89c14e27f2d43a9d62ccdfecf1148","title":"uk coronavirus eviction ban promise broken say critics","story":"Coronavirus bill extends notice for possession from two to three months but government stresses no renter can be evictedThe “complete ban” on evictions promised by the government has been widely criticised after it emerged that the coronavirus bill merely extends the notice required for possession, from two months to three.The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said last week: “The government is clear – no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.”But the shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said the new coronavirus bill goes back on that vow.He tweeted: “We’ve finally had the government’s amendment to the coronavirus bill spelling out its proposals on evictions, and I’m afraid it’s now clear Boris Johnson has broken his promise to the country’s 20 million renters.“This is not an evictions ban, as Labour argued for, and renters were eventually promised by Boris Johnson. This legislation does not stop people losing their homes as a result of coronavirus, just gives them some extra time to pack their bags.”The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the claim that it was rowing back on promises was “absolute nonsense”.A spokesman said: “As soon as legislation is passed, no new possession proceedings will begin – in either the social sector or the private rented sector – for at least the next three months. We have the power to extend this notice period if necessary.”Advice groups called on the government to implement a stronger ban.Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Simply extending notice periods to three months cannot be seen as ‘job done’. It means that people dealing with unimaginable financial uncertainty still face the prospect of being served with an eviction notice.“Over the coming days, the government must keep their promise and add to these changes to make sure no one loses the roof over their head as a result of coronavirus.”Tenants fear they will be left with huge debts, after they lose their jobs, are chased for arrears on rent, and then forced out of their homes with eviction notices.Caitlin Wilkinson, of Generation Rent, said: “This legislation fails to deliver on these promises in every respect. All these measures do is extend the notice period for evictions to three months, which will provide little comfort to those faced with losing their homes in the midst of a pandemic.“Equally worrying is the lack of provision made for rent arrears, which will stack up in the three-month period. Many renters will end up with thousands of pounds worth of debt and no means of paying it off. Landlords and tenants are expected to ‘work together’ to find a solution to suit both parties from June onwards – but there’s absolutely nothing to stop landlords from evicting tenants if they can’t pay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1dc5dce4b7246359c56fccb1da729f454fbc16/0_120_3547_2128/master/3547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f29fb1f97c5821259c0966a183ab15a","title":"coronavirus learning to cope with a new normal","story":"Columnist Zoe Williams has spent the week researching tips for life under a new regime of social distancing and self-isolation.

The jury later found him not guilty of 12 of the charges and said one was not proven, a verdict that also acquits the accused.“It’s pretty clear he intends to sue the Scottish government for damages,” said one ally. “He believes this came from the top.”His allies also believe prominent officials in Sturgeon’s office and the Scottish National party should be fired after text messages and emails came to light that Salmond argues raises serious questions about their role in the case, and their handling of allegations against him.One close friend of Salmond’s said the former SNP leader is also very keen to give evidence to a Holyrood investigation into a botched Scottish government internal inquiry into complaints of misconduct brought against him by two civil servants in 2018.The special committee of inquiry at Holyrood was set up after Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, admitted in January 2019 the internal investigation had the appearance of bias because the official in charge of it had prior contact with the complainants.The alleged assaults against the two civil servants were investigated by Police Scotland detectives and included in the charges levelled against Salmond during his trial. He was acquitted by the jury of both those sexual assaults on Monday.Salmond won his judicial review in January 2019 and in August 2019, the Scottish government paid out £512,000 to cover the legal fees he had incurred.The specially convened Holyrood committee, with includes three former SNP ministers, is due to start hearing witnesses later this year after the coronavirus outbreak has subsided. The Scottish parliament’s sessions have been significantly curtailed by the crisis.In the interim, the committee has asked to be given copies of non-confidential evidence used during the trial so MSPs can study the background papers during the lockdown period and spring recess next month.Before the trial, Salmond’s lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, presented in closed court details of text messages between senior figures in the Scottish government and SNP, which Salmond argues proves there was orchestration. Joanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP who is one of Salmond’s closest allies, said on Monday: “Some of the evidence which has come to light raises very serious questions over the process that was employed within the Scottish government to investigate the alleged complaints.”Sturgeon told reporters on Monday she was ready to give evidence after the coronavirus crisis was over. “The court has given a verdict, a decision, and that must be respected,” she said.“I have no doubt there will be further discussion around this issue in due course, and I will welcome that, but that time is not now. This country faces a crisis right now, bigger than we’ve ever faced before.”A close ally of Sturgeon’s dismissed claims by Salmond’s supporters that the first minister would be forced to resign due to the controversy. He said there were few MPs or MSPs who believed that was justified.“There are going to be difficulties ahead as we navigate through this,” he said. “Is this going to bring the first minister down? No, it’s not. I don’t see that they’ve got a mechanism to do that. It’s not great, but we will get through this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/672a37ae6fead972f74e5b1f02da491713f3aa91/0_79_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75aaba84c41c641c4e8d09f93b5e576","title":"coronavirus benefits sick pay and lost hours your rights in the uk","story":"Most UK support has focused on employees and those who are ill with Covid-19The coronavirus crisis has shut down many workplaces in the UK and forced the government to make major changes to the benefits system to support those who are unable to work.The self-employed have been told that they can expect more help, but most of the announcements have focused on employees and on anyone who is unable to work because they have the virus.Depending on which category you are in, here are your rights as things stand currently.Some employers have told workers that they will pay them as usual, at least for the next few weeks. If you are in that position and you do not usually receive any benefits, then you will not need to make a claim.The money has not yet been paid to companies – the Treasury has said it will be paid out “within weeks”. The payments will last up to three months and will be backdated to 1 March 2020.The maximum payment will be £2,500 a month.This is worth up to £29 a day but typically the payment is limited to only five days in any three-month period. At the moment no change to this has been announced.The pay pledge is designed to stop people losing their jobs. By covering their pay, the government hopes that firms will keep positions open so that eventually as many people as possible can return to work.If your employer has chosen to make you redundant despite this, there are rules that they need to meet – they cannot ignore your usual rights.The company may have its own policy which is more generous than the statutory minimum. If it does not have its own policy and you have worked for your current employer for at least two years you should be entitled to:• Half a week’s pay for each full year you were under 22.• One week’s pay for each full year you were 22 or older, but under 41.• One and half week’s pay for each full year you were 41 or older.You can calculate how much you are entitled to here.The chancellor has said he is working on pay measures for the self-employed but these have not yet been announced.In measures announced so far, Sunak has said that he will delay the date at which self-assessment tax payments are due. If you were due to pay a second instalment by 31 July you will not have to do so until January 2021.He has also removed the minimum income floor for universal credit claims – this should increase what you are entitled to. The standard allowance for a single universal credit claimant aged 25 or over is usually £317.82 a month but it is being increased to £409.89, and there are other elements you may be entitled to.Couples can claim more if your partner is still earning that will affect how much you can claim.You can apply online here.You should be eligible for sick pay. If you are an employee, your employer may have a scheme that is more generous than that offered by the government. If it does, it should pay you that.Otherwise you will be entitled to statutory sick pay. The payment is worth £94.25 a week and is paid for up to 28 weeks.The rules have also been changed so that statutory sick pay can be claimed from day one rather than day four as previously.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.If you are self-employed you cannot claim statutory sick pay but you can claim universal credit worth the same each week.You can get the isolation note that you need to show your employer or make a claim here.Employees are entitled to time off to look after dependants in an emergency – this includes a partner or parent as well as children.The time off is unlimited but employers are not obliged to pay you for this. Speak to your employer to find out its policy. If it does not pay, it may agree to let you use holiday or rearrange your working day to limit the financial impact.You can use the mortgage payment holiday scheme announced by the chancellor to stop your payments for three months and give yourself some breathing space.Lenders have been told that they must not charge fees for this, but there will be an additional cost over the term of your mortgage as interest will be building on the money you haven’t paid off.Your lender should outline the financial implications if you decide to take up the mortgage holiday. You need to contact them directly. Phone queues are very long but some are offering the service online so check your bank or building society’s website.Lenders have been told that they must not repossess anyone now.If you do not already claim a benefit and you are losing your job, you will be able to claim for support for housing as part of a universal credit application.There have also been moves to prevent landlords from evicting tenants, although these just prevent eviction for three months rather than the usual two.Speak to your landlord if you are having problems. Buy-to-let landlords have the option of taking a payment holiday and passing it on. It will cost them more for their mortgage in the long term, but they may be willing to accept that extra cost or negotiate a way to share it.The sums available through universal credit standard allowance and the basic element of working tax credit are both being increased by £1,040 a year for 12 months.Local councils have been given a £500m hardship fund so that they can help vulnerable households by reducing council tax for those who receive local council tax support.To find out what your circumstances make you eligible for, use one of the benefits calculators offered by charities.

That possibility has now been rejected, with the joint statement released on Tuesday by the IOC and the Tokyo organising committee saying the event will now commence on “a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021”. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, said his favoured option was “to postpone for about a year” but there has been some talk of holding a “Cherry Blossom Games” next spring. There are several obstacles to that happening: according to the Japanese Meteorological Agency, in 2019 the average temperature in Tokyo was a chilly 10.6C in March and 13.6C in April, and the first month in which they reliably exceed an outdoor-sport-friendly 20C is June more important, the Olympics would struggle to attract star names from the NBA before their season ends in June, from European football before their season ends, presumably in May (with a rescheduled Euro 2020 to follow) and from golf if it is run at the same time as the US Open in June 2021 or the Open in July. World Athletics has already indicated its willingness to move the 2021 world championships, which were to be held in Eugene, Oregon in August.Since last June tickets have been made available domestically, and to international fans through authorised resellers appointed by national Olympic committees, though they have often been bundled with travel, hotels or hospitality. As of 1pm GMT on Tuesday afternoon most, including Britain’s Team GB Live and CoSport in the USA (CoSport also handles sales in Australia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Jordan, Norway and Sweden), were selling tickets and packages online as normal. Around 5.08m of the total 7.8m tickets have already been sold. The next phase of ticket sales, in which they would be available directly from the 2020 Tokyo Games to customers worldwide, was due to start in May but will now be rescheduled. Refunds are likely to be offered to those who have already bought tickets: when in February the decision was taken to move the marathons to Sapporo, 800km from Tokyo, all existing ticket holders were immediately offered refunds (though depending on the new timing of the Olympics, the marathons may now be moved back to Tokyo as originally planned).So much has already been designed, printed or manufactured with the existing logo on – including around 5,000 medals, made in part from recycled consumer electronics – that a full-on renaming would be prohibitively wasteful and expensive.The flame was lit in a scaled-down ceremony in Olympia, Greece, on 12 March, and arrived in Japan last Friday. It is on display in Fukushima prefecture, one of the areas most affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and had been due to depart on Thursday for the start of a 121-day torch relay around Japan. The relay is now very likely to be postponed, but Tuesday’s announcement specified that the flame would remain in Japan. Quite where it will burn until the Games are rescheduled remains to be seen, with an official telling the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun only that they were “making adjustments to how the torch relay will be done”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce0a49f008608766aa8a341e8f152c8c7094bbd/0_254_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9bfc6b929754671bb2cc11534afed49","title":"tokyo olympics to be postponed to 2021 due to coronavirus pandemic","story":"The Tokyo Olympics are to be postponed until 2021 after talks between Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, led to confirmation of a decision made inevitable by the coronavirus pandemic.“We agreed that a postponement would be the best way to ensure that the athletes are in peak condition when they compete and to guarantee the safety of the spectators,” Abe told reporters shortly after his conference call with Bach, adding that the Games would be held by the summer of 2021.The Games “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community”, the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee said later in a joint statement.The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games will continue to be called the “Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020” even when they are held next year, and the Olympic flame will stay in Japan “as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times”.Some IOC members have already raised the prospect of a “cherry blossom”Games next April, however it is more likely that they will be staged in July 2021 when there are fewer sporting events due to take place. World Athletics has already indicated that it will be happy to shift its 2021 championships, which are due to take place in Eugene to 2022, and Fina, the organisers of the 2021 swimming world championships, in Japan next July, have said they will also follow suit.The postponement is a blow to the host country, which has spent more than $12bn on the event, while huge sums are also at stake for sponsors and broadcasters. Goldman Sachs estimated this month that Japan would lose $4.5bn (550bn yen) in inbound and domestic consumption in 2020 if the Olympics did not take place as planned. Others voiced disappointment that they would have to wait another year to watch their favourite athletes compete in Tokyo. “I’ve been looking forward to the Olympics and feel like crying,” one user tweeted. “But I understand it’s inevitable under the circumstances. My heart goes out to the athletes who have been striving to make the Olympics over the past four years – or even six-and-a-half years since Tokyo was chosen as the host city.”Yuji Ota, vice president of the Japan Fencing Federation, thanked everyone who had been involved in the Olympic preparations, telling them in a post: “What you have done means a lot.” He added. “But first we have to get through coronavirus. Health must come first.”Benoît Vêtu, the head coach of the Japan track cycling team, said the IOC had made the right decision. “It’s only just been announced, so I don’t know exactly how the riders feel about it, but we’ll discuss it in the morning during training,” Vêtu told the . “I know for sure that they will stay motivated for another year. We have a very big group with some talented riders, and now they have an extra year to keep improving.”The decision was welcomed by the British Olympic Association’s chief executive, Andy Anson, who said the organisers had no choice but to cancel the Games. “It is with profound sadness that we accept the postponement, but in all consciousness it is the only decision we can support, in light of the devastating impact Covid-19 is having on our nation, our communities and our families,” he said. “It is time for them to stop thinking about Tokyo 2020 for now and be home and safe with their families. It would have been unthinkable for us to continue to prepare for an Olympic Games at a time the nation and the world no less is enduring great hardship. A postponement is the right decision.”Sally Munday, the CEO of UK Sport, the Olympics and Paralympics funding body, promised to fully support British athletes and coaches amid the uncertainty of a “distressing period”. “We also realise that today’s decision has significant financial implications for our high-performance system and we are working hard to identify the wide-ranging impacts and scenarios, and are in close contact with government to establish how best to support our summer Olympic and Paralympic sports and athletes to be ready for the Games when they do take place.”Athletes were disappointed but broadly endorsed the delay, given health risks and disruption to their training as gyms, stadia and swimming pools shut down around the world.“Waited eight years for this, what’s another one in the grand scheme of things?” Britain’s world champion heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson wrote. “As an athlete, it’s heartbreaking news about the Olympics being postponed until 2021, but it’s for all the right reasons and the safety of everyone! Stay indoors!”However teenage Swedish pole vault world record holder Armand “Mondo” Duplantis, who was expected to be one of the stars of the Games, was more downbeat. “It’s a bummer, it’s a bummer that I won’t be able to compete in the Olympics this year, but you have to understand the situation, understand that some things are a little bigger than sport, and I guess we’ll have it next year.”The Games have never before been postponed in this way, but they were cancelled in 1916, 1940 – also a planned Tokyo Games – and 1944, during the first and second world wars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3711f40f94151157ba1d13f2c142d50239f2bcf/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=871d7b6ecfd4b22b8eca7654ee3f0cdb","title":"isabelle huppert interview french film industry metoo","story":"The French star’s fearless performances – and work ethic – are the stuff of legend. In her dressing room, she talks about the pain of theatre, acting in English and #MeTooIn 2005, days before my 17th birthday, I saw Isabelle Huppert in Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler at the Odéon theatre in Paris. It felt like being let in on a secret: I lived in a small town, and Huppert stood for the artistic life I imagined was available only to Parisians. Not only was she the first A-list actor I’d ever seen on stage, but she was the most fearless woman I could remember. In a diary entry at the time, I described her – admiringly – as “witch-like”.Fifteen years later, back at the Odéon, she is equally imposing, one-on-one. We met on a grey February morning, before the coronavirus crisis shut down the venue and closed the French capital. Huppert was in rehearsal for Ivo van Hove’s new production of Tennessee Williams’s The Glass Menagerie: the run was cut short after a week of performances, and a scheduled transfer to London’s Barbican in June remains in doubt.The French star was gearing up to play Amanda Wingfield, an ageing southern belle with a quicksilver temperament, who hopes to find a suitor for her frail daughter Laura. On paper, the role is right up her alley: few actors have so consistently sought out difficult, neurotic characters. Unlike many of her peers, Huppert has never seemed interested in being conventionally likable. It is part of her aura, and outside France, it would make her a prime candidate for flying the #MeToo flag within the film industry. Yet the day before Roman Polanski’s triumph at the Césars, the country’s equivalent of the Oscars, when I ask her about gender inequality in her profession, Huppert gets up and briskly shows me the door.Things had started well enough. Sitting in her dressing room, Huppert – often described as a guarded interviewee – is practically animated when discussing Tennessee Williams and her first collaboration with Van Hove, one of the world’s most in-demand stage directors. “Things fall into place without us realising it,” Huppert says of his directing style. “He doesn’t tell me much, but I like it that way.”Later, when I sit in on a rehearsal for The Glass Menagerie, I see Huppert’s vast experience in action. Even when she snaps her fingers repeatedly to get help with her lines from an assistant, she acts through it, the hesitation hardly registering on her face. Not that gearing up for a stage run is a walk in the park, she says. “At this point, there isn’t really any pleasure, just immense fatigue and fear. Theatre is really like climbing a very painful mountain. Of course, once you reach the summit, the view is beautiful. By comparison, cinema is just a nice, effortless stroll.”Huppert has made her mark as an eclectic screen presence, as comfortable in period costumes as she is in the French auteur world and in boundary-pushing international projects. If you grew up in France from the 1970s onwards, chances are you feel like you’ve always known her. Some remember her in Bertrand Blier’s Les Valseuses, the 1974 film that made her famous, or as Claude Goretta’s introverted Lacemaker. To me, she was Flaubert’s Madame Bovary (Claude Chabrol cast her in the role in 1991) and, above all, the repressed, masochistic Erika Kohut in Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher.It’s not unusual for her to have up to four or five feature films released in a given year. When she played herself on Call My Agent!, a French comedy series about a fictional talent agency with a roster of real-life stars, the joke was that Huppert was a workaholic who shot one film by day and another by night.When I ask how true to life that frantic schedule was, Huppert equivocates with a clipped laugh. In 2019, she appeared in films by Eva Ionesco and Anne Fontaine as well as in Ira Sachs’s Frankie, which garnered mixed reviews at Cannes and is due to be released later this year. Huppert plays a terminally ill French actor who takes her extended family on holiday in Portugal, and the film capitalised on her ability to flit between different languages (here, French and English). “You’re always a little different when you’re not acting in your mother tongue,” she says. “You’re kind of a stranger to yourself. It’s sometimes limiting, but it can also give you more freedom.”Huppert has also acted in Italian and in Russian, and for her next film, Jean-Paul Salomé’s Mama Weed, she spent a few months learning Arabic. In this adaptation of an award-winning French novel by Hannelore Cayre, The Godmother, a translator for the justice system becomes involved in a drug deal to provide for her ageing mother and children.While Mama Weed’s release, initially scheduled for late March, will have to wait, the trailer drew some criticism on social media because Huppert’s character, as part of her Breaking Bad-style transformation, takes to wearing a headscarf and pretends to be of Arab descent. Still, it’s in keeping with the spirit of The Godmother, which highlights the race and class bias in French drug cases: in the book, her character is able to bamboozle police investigators because they don’t speak Arabic and won’t suspect a white woman.Regardless of the language at hand, you can trust Huppert to do Huppert. “I don’t conform. The way I act is my own, still,” she chuckles. Listening to her, it feels a little as if she is ready to jump into a role at any time. She might as well have been in character as Frankie’s film star when we meet: that day, a photographer was following her for a magazine spread, and on the way to her dressing room, up to the stairs and down a corridor, Huppert had paused our convoy every few metres to make time for a shot, with unapologetic confidence.Surely, I think naively, Huppert is uniquely well-positioned to talk about women’s experiences in the French film industry without fear of retribution. When I ask what her reaction was to Harvey Weinstein’s recent conviction, she lets out an extended “Ah,” and tenses up.“Well, listen … It’s the course of events … I think I had the same reaction as everyone else. A reaction obviously of sympathy for the victims, of course.”I soldier on: “Do you agree to some extent with Adèle Haenel, who told the New York Times that France ‘missed the boat’ on #MeToo?”And with that, the interview is over. In a matter of seconds, Huppert is on her feet and walks away from me, manifestly irked. “Listen, here, now I have to work.” Dumbfounded, I follow her towards the door. “It’s not that I don’t want to talk, but I’m tired, I need to go work.”Before leaving, I pause for one factual question. Did she really sign an open letter, published in the French newspaper Libération in February, in support of Yorgos Loukos, a ballet director dismissed for discrimination against a pregnant dancer? Prominent signatories later denied agreeing to its terms. She gives me the kind of withering look usually reserved for her onscreen foes before answering: “Yes, I signed it, there.”The next night, Roman Polanski was named best director at the César awards. Haenel walked out of the auditorium in outrage, followed by a handful of others. (Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old in the US but fled before sentencing. He was later accused of sexual assault by several women he denies all of the claims.) The César moment exposed a deep ambivalence in the French arts world about #MeToo, especially among Huppert’s generation. Far from Hollywood’s public displays of unity, in 2018, Catherine Deneuve and others have defended men’s “right to pester”. On prime-time TV after the Césars ceremony, Huppert merely offered a quote she credited to William Faulkner: “Lynching is a form of pornography.”At the same time, I thought about my teenage self, who saw a different kind of heroine in the French star. To be clear, Huppert owes her, and the predominantly young women who have led the #MeToo push in France, nothing. She has worked with far more female directors than most of her peers, and has said in the past that “men are not afraid of women the way women are afraid of men”.Yet a moment from the rehearsal of The Glass Menagerie I witnessed stubbornly came to mind. When Amanda learns that Laura’s potential suitor, Jim, is actually engaged to another woman, she bids him farewell with this line: “I wish you luck – and happiness – and success.” If pauses could kill, the glacial chill that Huppert sent through the room after the word “luck” would have been it. Imagine if she channelled all of her boldness and status into speaking out against power abuse. It might be another mountain to climb, but I wouldn’t bet against her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2b895264f7a2499f8ed23ada204ce384c066253/0_81_2369_1422/master/2369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4500dc065251bd81efcc3f03f889912e","title":"the mandalorian review baby yoda has finally come to the uk was it worth the wait disney","story":"Disney+ has launched in Britain – bringing with it the first episodes of a live-action Star Wars series that follows the adventures of a bounty hunter in a galaxy far, far awayThere is one basic test that The Mandalorian – the biggest original TV series on the Disney+ launch roster – passes. It is cool. The monsters are cool, the spaceships are cool, the robots are cool. The landscapes: whoa. The interspecies bar fights: crackin’. This show was expensive – reportedly $15m (£12.9m) an episode. While that does not guarantee an uninterrupted stream of memeable zingers, based on the first two episodes, that is what Disney has got.In case you have been self-isolating on an arid moon, we are in the Star Wars universe here, located temporally between the last of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi, and the first of JJ Abrams’ sequels, The Force Awakens. The atmosphere is thick the evil empire is only five years in the past. On the outer reaches of the galaxy, things are tense and lawless.We track the titular bounty hunter, who, like Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back, is hidden behind a helmet that reveals nothing of his face. That is the ceiling on the show’s appeal: Pedro Pascal, the lead actor, is limited to dialogue and movement. The Mandalorian, show and character, is not especially charming. But Pascal is playing an emotionally ascetic mercenary. The show is not meant to be charming. It is meant to be cool.In any event, two things are established by a lithe preamble in which the Mandalorian despatches a whole saloon full of miscreants in order to capture a chatty blue creature he has been paid to arrest. First, this is a western. Second, Pascal can do a fair bit with dialogue and movement. He is a badass, for sure, but he is also cynical and purposeful, with a weary wit. He is Robocop. He is Clint Eastwood. He is Ryan Gosling in Drive. He is not messing about and neither is the series, as an over-the-odds, off-the-books job takes our man to a secret bunker crawling with black-and-white stormtroopers, which feels like walking into an underground club in 50s Paris and finding it full of uniformed Nazis. Also in there is … Werner Herzog!The casting of Herzog as the Client, an imperious – and indeed imperial – iceman for whom you do not want to be working, announces that The Mandalorian is not afraid to take a gamble, high-stakes though every creative decision under the Star Wars banner is. It is the first of a run of wins, as Herzog’s lethal eccentric is replaced as the Mandalorian’s foil by Nick Nolte as the voice of dignified, jowly vapour farmer Kuiil, a survivor of the empire’s jackboot. His catchphrase – “I have spoken” – lends him the air of a septuagenarian history teacher who effortlessly keeps command of the class. Then Nolte hands the baton to Taika Waititi as IG-11, a leggy pedant of a droid whose hips can rotate through 360 degrees and who keeps threatening to self-destruct when he and Mandy get into a Butch Cassidy predicament.All this is the work of the writer and showrunner Jon Favreau, who was Monica’s cage-fighting boyfriend in Friends and the guy from Swingers and Chef, but who is somehow also the director of Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and the remakes of The Jungle Book and The Lion King. In other words, he knows how to helm an entertainment mothership reliably, but is not so afraid of breaking it that he can’t mess around. As a result, you can’t tell whether a sly joke or a colossal set piece is incoming, but you know whichever it is will be effective.The Mandalorian’s best creation, and the twist at the end of episode one, preceded it on social media (since Disney+, and this show, launched in the US in November). The Child, immediately given the obvious moniker Baby Yoda by fans, turns out to be the illicit quarry on which the whole series will turn. Our pal the bounty hunter has to look after a tiny, excessively cute 50-year-old infant (species age at different rates, don’t-cha-know), whose floating crib is another example of Favreau using groundbreaking effects technology to come up with something simple but profoundly satisfying.In episode two, which is given over entirely to the Mandalorian extricating himself from a gaggle of annoying, thieving Jawas, we see a little of what an adorable, large-eared toddler version of Yoda is capable of, as the Force rejoins us and we return to familiar Star Wars folklore. But that is a crutch the show has the confidence to regularly toss aside.The ideal TV spin-off should bow to the franchise that bore it, then strut off on its own without looking too fretful about whether the die-hards follow. In this case, they surely will: The Mandalorian is too cool to resist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7de25808f4f05d18290438737938409c086191f7/0_155_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa068e2cdf84fc6ca66f8d315cb50fdc","title":"have i already had covid19 coronavirus","story":"Covid-19 symptoms, when they occur, vary widely and undertesting means many people have probably been unwittingly infectedCovid-19 symptoms vary widely, and undertesting in many countries means that many people may have already had the coronavirus without having received a positive diagnosis. Is it possible to find out, and how should you behave if you think you may have been infected? Dr William Hillmann: At this point, we don’t have a test to tell that. We are developing antibody tests to check for a prior infection, but those aren’t ready for clinical use yet. The only definitive way to know that you’ve had it is to get tested while you have it and to have that test be positive.Hillmann: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms – runny nose, congestion, sore throat – to people with more flu-like symptoms – high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we’re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care. (Editor’s note: recent reports  suggest that loss of smell and taste are also signs of Covid-19 infection.)When people are symptomatic, they’re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they’re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It’s hard to know if that’s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that’s just dead virus that the body is shedding.Buchholz: We all have to be role models. If we’re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.Hillmann: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene.Buchholz: I would, absolutely. I’m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it’s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.Hillmann: It’s up to every inidual about what they feel is right. If somebody is diagnosed with a case of coronavirus, I might feel a little bit more strongly that they should tell people because if you’re in close contact with a healthcare worker, it could have implications for precautions that healthcare worker needs to take.Buchholz: There’s not been any evidence that anyone’s gotten it more than once. Someone with a normal immune system that can react to the virus and get better should have immunity for quite some time, at least a year, if not lifelong.Dr David Buchholz, senior founding medical director, primary care, assistant professor of pediatrics, Columbia University Irving medical centerDr William Hillmann, associate inpatient physician director at Massachusetts general hospital"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

That is a major concern for Hernando Enrique Mattos Dager, the rear admiral in charge of the Colombia’s Poseidon taskforce against drug traffickingThe rudimentary submarines, fashioned in secret workshops deep in the mangrove swamps of north-western Pacific coast, are notoriously difficult for navy patrols or radar to detect. They cruise “flush with the surface of the water, and the part that protrudes above the surface is very small,” Dager said.For all their recent success, Dager and his taskforce know that they have probably only encountered the tip of the iceberg. As with all interceptions of illicit drugs, the feeling once the initial euphoria subsides is that many more get through than are ever detected. The authorities seized 433 tonnes of cocaine in 2019, more than half by the navy, but production was estimated to be more than 1,000 tonnes.In November, a 22-metre semi-submersible vessel was intercepted on the other side of the Atlantic, off Spain’s Galician coast. It was carrying around three tonnes of cocaine, and two of its three crew members were reportedly from Ecuador.Evidence of the successes of Dager’s taskforce is littered among the mangrove roots around its base in the south-western port of Tumaco. The town is situated just north of the border with Ecuador in Nariño department, which has more land under coca cultivation than anywhere else in the country. It accounted for about a quarter of the 169,000 hectares (417,600 acres) under cultivation nationwide in 2018. Tumaco is known as “the pearl of the Pacific” for its stunning beaches, but it has also become a flashpoint in Colombia’s long fight against drug trafficking.Painted in blue, grey and pastel greens, the submarines’ fibreglass hulls appear to have more in common with Jules Verne’s Nautilus in his 19th-century novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea than a sophisticated seagoing submersible. But these low-profile boats are designed to take to the sea with their decks awash, carrying their cargo just beneath the waves and out of sight.Rumours that the cartels were using submarines began in the 1990s, and in 2006 the navy intercepted one off Costa Rica with 3.5 tonnes of cocaine on board.The cramped submarines are crewed by between two and four men, usually recruited from local fishing communities, often in Ecuador. If naval patrols discover them, the crew members “open valves to let in water and sink the vessel, sinking the evidence,” before jumping into the water, said Captain Victor Santos Pacheco, commander of the local coastguard, which often rescues crews from the sea.The vessels can reach Central America in two or three days. Those that head further north to the Mexican or US coast are replenished at sea with water, food and fuel, indicating elaborate logistics. Crew members can earn up to $50,000 (£43,000) for a long crossing, but see it as a risk worth taking, according to officials. “A kilo of cocaine is worth $30,000 on the streets of New York,” said Dager.The taskforce has recently seen evidence of an increase in the use of submarines to transport marijuana. “It could correspond to the fact that its consumption has been authorised in some countries,” said Dager. “This has opened up an interesting international market ... The production of marijuana in Colombia is very economical ... at $100 a kilo, and it sells for up to $7,000 in the US.”The cartels are constantly upping the ante in a cat-and-mouse game on the high seas. They are now using winged torpedo-like tubes known as “parasites” that are fixed to thehulls of large ships, Pacheco said. They also have a new tactic – a GPS-equipped “buoyed cargo” designed for clandestine recovery at sea.“Narco-trafficking is innovative. It never stops,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c77fbe8ab122cb55f7cbbd31d551a2b41317be/0_326_5108_3067/master/5108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82f233b1677e861de8a45a41a56f26fa","title":"coronavirus how do italy and the uk compare","story":"With Britain approximately two weeks behind Italy in Covid-19 deaths, questions about the nations’ similarities remain The coronavirus established itself early on in Italy where reported deaths are now in excess of those recorded in China.But is the crisis witnessed in Italy about to play out in the UK? And when are lockdowns and other interventions likely to start to make a difference?Though there are some similarities – the picture is complexThe death toll in Britain is roughly two weeks behind that of Italy, according to researchers who have analysed the data.In week 10 of this year, ending 6 March, Italy announced 176 new Covid-19 deaths, comparable to the 166 deaths the UK reported in week 12.If the spread of the pandemic in the UK tracks Italy’s closely, the domestic death toll could soon rise sharply.Italian authorities recorded 1,066 new Covid-19 deaths in week 11, the equivalent of this week in the UK’s outbreak.“It looks as though we are two weeks behind Italy in number of Covid-19 deaths,” said Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the MRC’s Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University.“But all this means is that we have comparable population sizes and had a comparable number of deaths in week 12 as Italy had in week 10. We may be on a less steep trajectory than Italy, but it’s too early to know yet.”Spiegelhalter stressed that the outlook was “all very uncertain at the moment” not least because the two populations and their nations’ responses to the outbreak differ so much. There was “some reason for hope,” he said of the UK situation, “although we will must be ready for having hundreds of deaths a day.”The same analysis hints that Italy may be approaching a peak in its epidemic, but the answer will only be clear if the country continues to report falling numbers of new deaths over the coming days and weeks.The UK’s peak may not be so severe if the UK’s response to the outbreak has been effective, Spiegelhalter said, but the answer to that is not yet clear.Compared with Britain, Italy had less time to prepare, the virus may have been circulating more widely before it was detected, and the country has more older people who are more tightly connected to family and friends.However, comparisons present problems, as it’s not possible to truly compare like-with-like.One factor that will have a substantial impact on deaths is the capacity for hospitals to care for the most seriously ill patients, and this differs markedly from country to country. “When you hit the capacity of intensive care beds then you might get an additional shift up which could reset the rate of increase thereafter,” said Bird.Testing and the number of confirmed cases is also an issue.Differences in testing policy, for example, will account for some of the variations in mortality rates as testing more patients will increase the number of confirmed cases, and is likely to reduce the overall mortality rate. Data on patient characteristics such as age and underlying health conditions is another factor we don’t know about.As Adam Kucharski, who is modelling the outbreak at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, points out, deaths reported today do not reflect the state of the epidemic at the moment.Those who die are typically infected about four weeks earlier. “Strictly speaking we should say something like: transmission in the UK four weeks ago was where Italy was about six weeks ago,” he said.For the same reason, the impact of the cascade of lockdowns across Italy, and ever more stringent restrictions on movement brought in across the UK, will take time to show up in the daily death tolls. A wave of Italians fled to the country’s south when news leaked on 8 March that the government intended to quarantine 16 million people in the high-risk north. If those people carried the infection with them, the deaths that result are not likely to show up until at least the start of next week.In the UK, where pubs, clubs, restaurants and theatres shuttered only days ago, and school closures began this week, any resulting impact on deaths will not be apparent until mid-April soonest. “It’s quite likely to be at least three weeks before we see a slow down in the deaths. And they will potentially still be increasing. It depends how much social distancing we’ve managed to achieve,” said Bird."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883780f5e17542dd87d86f32e628f371acbf2977/275_66_3039_1823/master/3039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a2b6e8cd24b2d1353b5ac5132c2601","title":"how is your university supporting you during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"If you are a university student we want to hear how your institution is supporting you Students at Oxford and Cambridge will have their summer exams replaced with online assessments due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The process for 2022-26 was due to begin in the autumn. Instead the current portfolio will be rolled over for an extra year to 2023.In nuts and bolts terms, the package means:• Artists and creative practitioners will be eligible for cash grants of up to £2,500 from the £20m pot. ACE is also planning to make grants of up to £4m to existing benevolent funds for cultural workers.• Organisations outside the national portfolio will be able to apply for grants up to £35,000 from the £50m fund. It is aimed at helping them “to get back on their feet” or to make work in the future, which will mean they can contribute to the “Let’s Create” strategy.• The £90m programme for portfolio organisations includes advancing current grants by up to six months to help with cashflow. The stringent conditions that normally apply to funding will be relaxed.ACE said it regretted suspending national lottery grants. “At this time of crisis, we believe that this budget is best spent on sustaining the sector. We will prioritise reopening this stream of funding as early as possible.”Darren Henley, the chief executive of ACE, said: “Right now, our number one priority is to do everything we can to help inidual artists and cultural organisations to stay afloat. It’s going to be tough, but we need them to be in the best possible shape to use their creativity to benefit people’s lives in villages, towns and cities across England once our communities begin the process of recovering from this terrible virus.“Already, I’ve seen artists and cultural organisations draw on their bottomless ingenuity and creativity to dream up ways to connect, comfort and uplift us as we face these uniquely challenging circumstances.“This is a frightening time for all of us. But, as we distance ourselves from one another in our daily lives, I believe the role of arts and culture in helping to bring us all together will become ever more critical.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a5780b2c6a60048e13d6d1c78666dc6a6a6c803/0_0_3115_1869/master/3115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ca45158ee98f4237c96ff1c50b60844","title":"budding couples in uk told to live together or stay apart","story":"Lockdown may lead to awkward conversations as government issues clarificationThe coronavirus lockdown may have unintentionally sparked a wave of awkward conversations within new relationships, after the government told couples who do not cohabit that they must either not meet at all, or else rapidly move in together.The clarification came from Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, who was asked at the regular Downing Street press conference on Tuesday whether couples who lived apart could socialise at all under the new restrictions intended to slow the spread of the virus.“I’m clearly going to start a new career here in relationship counselling, so I will tread very carefully as I work through this answer,” Harries began, explaining that the principle of the lockdown, announced on Monday night, was for people to stay in their household units.Under the new rules, people must stay at home unless shopping for necessities, working if they cannot do this remotely, attending to medical matters, caring for vulnerable people, or exercising – with no close contact allowed with people not in the immediate household.The lockdown will be reviewed after three weeks, but the expectation is that there will be no significant loosening of the rules until May or June at the earliest.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“If the two halves of a couple are currently in separate households, ideally they should stay in those households,” Harries said.“The alternative might be that, for quite a significant period going forwards, they should test the strength of their relationship and decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.”What the government did not want, Harries said, was “people switching in and out of households – it defeats the purpose of the reduction in social interaction, and will allow transmission of disease”.She added: “So perhaps, test really carefully your strength of feeling, stay with the household, either together or apart, but keep it that way while we go forward, because otherwise we will not all be working towards achieving our outcome.”If that was not clear enough Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who was leading the press conference, added: “There you go. Make your choice and stick with it.”The event was the first virtual press conference held, to keep within the rules about avoiding all contact. Journalists were able to ask questions, but did so via video link, with Hancock, Harries and the third speaker, Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, while watching them on a TV screen.Adding to the distancing regime, the lecterns at which the three speakers stood much further apart than at earlier press conferences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2703eda6c4eb79ac8c11ea9b07ca2183","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

One Tory MP said there was a political argument that Johnson may be keen to “drag Labour in” so the public do not associate the crisis solely with the Conservatives, if the situation worsens.They fear that Johnson could end up losing public support – despite surveys currently showing he is strongly backed – if it looks like he alone is responsible for a crisis that ends up involving tens of thousands of deaths.Johnson’s hero Winston Churchill ran a national unity government with Labour’s Clement Attlee as his deputy and Arthur Greenwood as a senior minister.But one Tory MP said they already fear that even if Johnson comes to be regarded favourably like a Churchill, then the public could still be ready for a postwar Attlee-type figure – such as Starmer – if they want to see public services properly funded and rebuilt after the crisis is over.Another Conservative MP said they thought No 10 would be considering a cross-party coronavirus council as an option if emergency measures have to go on for some time “as democratic consensus will be needed for a continued suspension of everyday life, especially if parliament cannot sit”.Opposition politicians gave a mixed reaction to the idea of a national unity government. Starmer, the Labour leadership favourite, is focusing on trying to push No 10 to do the right thing on guaranteeing income and strict physical distancing, also called social distancing, rather than countenancing a national unity government.However, Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rival leadership candidate is understood not to be ruling out the idea of more cross-party cooperation or even a government of national unity because of the crisis situation that the government finds itself in.The third Labour leadership candidate, Lisa Nandy, said it would be better to draft opposition figures, unions, business groups and others onto a “national Cobra”, than form an official unity government.“Decisions are being made in real time,” she said. “Rather than having a reshuffle and trying to bed in a new government what you really need is a decision-making body that essentially takes this over until it’s dealt with.”Labour would need to be among those represented, Nandy said. “There is absolutely no reason I can see why someone like Gordon Brown wouldn’t be in the meeting room, helping to steer us through this. He’s dealt with not just the global financial crash, but foot and mouth as well. We really do need to start drawing on a wider pool of expertise.”A national Cobra would be better placed to spot issues with plans, Nandy said, and so avoid “what we’ve seen in the past few weeks, which is the government coming up with a plan, announcing it, the plan then unravels, and people are brought in to try and sort it out”.A more cohesive approach was vital, she said: “My sense is people are losing confidence in what they are being told, and if people start ignoring advice we’re going to be in a new level of trouble”.Layla Moran, a leading candidate for the Liberal Democrat leadership, agreed that rather than the disruption of rejigging ministerial posts in a formal unity government, a better approach would be “a more formal arrangement of cross-party working, through joint Cobra and subject-specific committee meetings”.The government has engaged in some cross-party working so far, allowing Scottish first minister and Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, Labour Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, and the Democratic Unionist party first minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster into emergency meetings.It reluctantly allowed Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, into Cobra meetings in recent weeks. He revealed on Tuesday that there had been disagreement over whether construction sites should be shut, with the prime minister resisting such a move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32669dcaec3e20ba3b3d8e9b80004a0c91a209b9/0_236_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79294ec703b1222198436dec6e574c06","title":"eu urged to evacuate asylum seekers from cramped greek island camps coronavirus","story":"Calls for evacuation of 42,000 people to prevent ‘many deaths’ from coronavirusThe European Union has been urged to evacuate asylum seekers from overcrowded camps on the Greek islands in order to save lives.The European parliament’s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee has called for the evacuation of 42,000 people on the Greek islands as “an urgent preventive” measure to avoid “many deaths” from coronavirus.Holding facilities on all five Aegean isles opposite the Turkish coast are currently six times over capacity.The first case of Covid-19 on the islands was confirmed earlier this month when a Greek woman on Lesbos, the island long on the frontline of the refugee crisis, tested positive. A Greek man, recently returned from Thailand, was diagnosed with the virus on Monday, reinforcing fears of an outbreak in camps seen as especially high-risk environments .MEPs fear that if the virus spreads it could become a public health emergency in the squalid camps, where thousands live in unsanitary conditions, often without electricity, heating or running water.“Many of those in the camps are already in precarious health situations due to the bad conditions in which they have lived for a long time,” states the letter from Juan Fernando López Aguilar, a Spanish socialist MEP, who chairs the committee. “There is no chance of isolation or social distancing, nor is it possible to ensure appropriate hygienic conditions,” he wrote.The letter adds that only six intensive care beds are available on Lesbos for residents and asylum seekers. The notorious Moria camp on Lesbos houses nearly 20,000 people in a space designed for 2,200.“If the EU fails to take immediate action, the situation on the Greek islands will become unmanageable with the risk of many deaths. This is an emergency and the EU has to react accordingly,” the letter states.The MEPs want people over 60 with existing health conditions evacuated first, but do not spell out whether they should go to other EU member states or the Greek mainland.The European commission said it was working with Greece on an emergency response plan to deal with a potential outbreak of coronavirus on the islands. A commission spokesperson said Greek authorities were taking action to prevent the spread of the disease, with compulsory temperature testing of new arrivals to the camps, suspension of visits, regular cleaning of communal areas, and the setting up of quarantine and recovery areas.The spokesperson also referred to an ongoing push to encourage EU member states to give a home to unaccompanied children on the Greek islands. Seven countries pledged earlier this month to take in 1,600 children from the islands.Growing restrictions on everyday life across Europe raise questions about how quickly relocation can happen.Greece went into nationwide lockdown on Monday, limiting residents to their homes for all but essential journeys.A few days before the lockdown began, Ylva Johansson, EU commissioner for home affairs, told journalists that Greek authorities were carrying out age assessments on asylum seekers in order to begin relocation of children.She also said asylum procedures in many EU member states were slowing down. “Many member states have put asylum processes on hold because they don’t want to do face-to-face meetings and then there are no interviews with asylum seekers. Some member states are beginning to do that on Skype instead, but this brings some delay into the system.”Restrictions on travel from Europe are also slowing the return of people whose asylum claims have been rejected, to their country of origin. “This is not really a problem yet, but there are a lot of cases that we know are on hold and that could cause problems in the long run,” Johansson said.Human rights groups have urged Athens to take action. In a joint statement on Tuesday , 21 groups said: “Extremely limited access to running water, toilets, and showers, as well as hours-long lines for food distribution and insufficient medical and nursing personnel, make it impossible to abide by the guidelines for protection from the coronavirus, putting people at significantly heightened risk in the face of the growing threat of widespread Covid-19 transmission.”Speaking to the  last week, the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed hope that around 5,000 migrants would help ease the pressure by “taking up” the EU’s “generous offer”, but acknowledged it was just the tip of the iceberg. The scheme to relocate up to 1,600 unaccompanied minors to other member states wasn’t expected to be in place until May, he said.As an emergency step, authorities have placed all of the migrant camps on lockdown since March 16, banning visitors, including aid agencies, from entering them. The measure was enforced a week before similar restrictions came into effect nationwide.Earlier this month, some 450 people, who arrived on the outposts after March 1st- when Greece closed its borders to asylum seekers following Turkey’s threat to “open the gates to Europe” - were moved in a tank landing vessel to detention centres on the mainland. Athens’ migration minister Notis Mitarachis said authorities had deliberately kept the new arrivals away from the camps to reduce the risk of an outbreak. But he conceded that it is only a matter of time before the virus reached the camps. “It is a given that there will be cases,” he told Sunday’s Eleftheros Typos newspaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df29ca634df2b38d06884781beeb49b76cabde1d/0_0_2697_1619/master/2697.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeee0cb8efeaae1bae1864c2b42913fd","title":"greta thunberg says its extremely likely she has had coronavirus","story":"Activist says she self isolated and warns young people to take the outbreak seriouslyGreta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the global school climate strikes, says it is “extremely likely” she has had the Covid-19 virus.A few days later she said they both began to feel ill, and she complained of feeling tired with “shivers, sore throat and cough”.Thunberg said she had not been tested for the virus, in line with the policy in Sweden, and was now “basically recovered”.But she issued an urgent warning to other young people to take the virus seriously – even if they themselves were often only facing mild symptoms.“We who do not belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others.”The school strike movement has propelled millions of young people on to the streets in countries on every continent to demand urgent action to avoid widespread breakdown.

By comparison, just 70,000 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK, with 6,650 confirmed cases of the disease. Neighbouring Belarus has an infection rate that is three times higher per capita.Sobyanin’s remarks made him the first senior Russian official to publicly contradict the official tally and directly urge greater action from the Russian president in response to the outbreak. He called for prophylactic measures to be taken by the heads of all of Russia’s regions, including the extension of a self-isolation regime for elderly Russians considered most at-risk from the disease.He also saidthat Russia’s healthcare system could be overwhelmed if it was not prepared for a rise in patients, and urged greater testing throughout the country.“No one in the world knows the real picture,” Sobyanin said.The Kremlin has largely presented the situation with the disease as under control, with top officials including Putin telling the public that the greatest danger was panic. But Tuesday marked a change in the government’s rhetoric, with Putin suddenly donning a yellow protective suit and respirator to tour the capital’s main hospital for coronavirus patients.Earlier on Tuesday, a woman died at the hospital in Kommunarka. Doctors claimed she had not been ill with coronavirus, and had died because of complications from cancer. Russia has tallied only one death linked to the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cdbafc3a5cbc5c1016586cef8a90d57d10f1b0/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64dd8cad2cbc90baab7655e90e8391c0","title":"superdads and magic potions italian kids life in lockdown","story":"Many have lost relatives but they are using their imagination to fight back against coronavirusIn early March, when the government closed schools and imposed a national lockdown, the lives of millions of Italian children were turned upside down. Since the beginning of the outbreak, more than 300 children have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the Italian Paediatric Society.The effects of Covid-19 on children are, in most cases, comparable to a normal flu. But while the virus seems more forgiving towards the young, it can be merciless towards older adults. As of Tuesday, Covid-19 had killed 6,077 people in Italy.Many children have lost their grandparents or other relatives, while their parents struggle with the virus.  spoke to a number of Italian children about how they are coping and how they are trying to use their imagination and creativity to fight back against Covid-19.Andrea, who is in lockdown at home with his mother and younger sister, hasn’t seen his father since 2 March. “The doctors took him to the hospital to get well,” his mother told him.Andrea’s father is one of more than 230 Covid-19 patients in hospital in Catania, Sicily. In anticipation of seeing him again, Andrea’s only way to express his affection is to make drawings, which the doctors have dutifully delivered to his father.In one of these, Andrea imagined how to stop the spread of coronavirus. In his imagination, someone mistakenly opened the door to the dimension that separates our world from the virus. It’s not easy to close it again, but SuperAndrea and SuperDad are up to the task, shielded by the energy of a giant, sparkling heart that coronavirus can’t penetrate. But the door won’t be closed until his father is discharged from that cursed hospital.“Hi, Daddy. I hope you feel better. I love you a lot and hope you get well so we can play again,” Andrea wrote in a recent message, adding: “If we don’t want coronavirus to get stronger, then we have to stay home,” Andrea wrote on a piece of paper entitled My Thoughts on Coronavirus, in which he calls out to all Italians: “Don’t eat too much. Otherwise you’ll have to go out to get groceries, and then you might get the virus if you leave the house.”People in Italy’s southern regions are bracing themselves as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases grows daily. In locked-down Palermo, Sicily, Michele has already found a cure for Covid-19.“It’s a magic potion. You see, coronavirus is a small little creature, almost invisible. You can only see it using a microscope. It can jump from one spot to another. And there’s not just one. It can multiply. We have to use the magic potion to hit the biggest of them, the coronavirus monster that brought them to life. If we splash it with the magic potion, then all the other viruses will die.”And if Michele’s strategy doesn’t work, he already has a plan B: the sun. Even if the World Health Organization hasn’t confirmed that higher spring temperatures might weaken the virus, Michele knows that the sun will kill it. “It’ll use a flaming sword,” he says. “Unless I discover the potion first. I’m even starting to get bored here in the house. Fine, I don’t have to go to school every day, but I miss my friends and classmates.”Marco and his younger brother live in Lozzo Atestino, in the province of Padua – one of the first Italian cities hit by the virus. The two brothers and their parents have all been ill with Covid-19.Marco wrote to the : “Unfortunately, my little brother and I had the bad luck of getting to know the coronavirus. Everything started on 20 February, when we found out the virus had arrived in neighbouring towns. Mum tried to reassure me by saying we’re all healthy, but a few days later she got sick and I was worried and sad.”While the children haven’t shown serious symptoms, their parents got increasingly unwell until they needed to be taken to hospital. “That was the worst day,” Marco says. “I remember we were in the ambulance and my mum wasn’t breathing well. My little brother started crying. When we arrived at the hospital, I started crying too because I thought they’d have to take us away from our parents.”Fortunately, that didn’t happen, and from that point on Marco and his family began a long period of quarantine that is still under way. “The days go by and we can’t have any contact with anyone. Mum orders groceries using the phone, and they leave the bags outside at the gate. I see my grandparents, aunts and uncles on video calls.”While waiting for the results of the next round of tests, Marco and his brother see the outside world through a large window in their home. “I can’t wait until coronavirus will just leave us in peace,” he says. “I can’t wait to go and play outside. But if there’s one thing I learned, it’s the importance of health and the love of my family.”Coronavirus has pushed the city of Bergamo, Lombardy, to its limits there aren’t even enough coffins to transport the dead. A thousand people have died here since the outbreak of the crisis. Crematorium ovens are unable to keep up, and the armed forces have to transfer the bodies to other cities.Greta and Riccardo have run out of paper, when drawing is one of the most important activities that keeps them busy while shut in their home. For weeks, Italians have been hanging large paper sheets from their windows with a rainbow and the phrase “Andrà tutto bene” (everything will be fine).Greta and Riccardo wanted to make one, too, but they can’t buy paper because shops are closed. To join in the movement, they managed to glue four precious sheets together. But as the days drag on, the children’s nerves are on edge. “I feel really bad, I get bored too much, and nothing’s getting better,” Greta repeats to her mother.In Bologna, in the region of Emilia-Romagna, things are no better. There are more than 7,000 cases of coronavirus here, and 800 people have died. Francesco has no intention of giving up. He sees the emergency as a struggle between David and Goliath. David represents the humans. Goliath, the coronavirus, says: “I’m going to infect the whole world!” How can such a small creature like David defeat the virus?Francesco has no doubt. The weapon people have to defeat the virus is the same strength that has been uniting Italy: “You won’t be able to infect the world as long as there’s humanity!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26142c422fd70ac9523d9295448900aa8c832715/0_3_6558_3935/master/6558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bfc174c6316fb3b1e38826d2b4e40a3","title":"uk bicycle shops and repairers see a surge in business during coronavirus lockdown","story":"People are aiming to avoid public transport and stay mobile during the coronavirus outbreak, bike shops reportBicycle retailers and repair shops have welcomed the chance to continue trading during the UK’s lockdown after the government labelled them an essential service alongside supermarkets and pharmacies.The bicycle industry has seen a surge in business in recent weeks, particularly for bicycle menders as people get old bikes out of their sheds in a bid to avoid public transport during the coronavirus outbreak.The Association of Cycle Traders (ACT) said that members had reported a boom in mending, while sales of cheaper bikes had also been strong, as commuters decided to travel on two wheels rather than risk infection on trains, buses or the tube.The UK’s biggest cycle chains, Evans and Halfords, have both closed temporarily but the ACT expects the majority of its members to stay open for now, as long as they can find a way to trade responsibly without putting staff and customers at risk.Jonathan Harrison of the ACT said: “In the last 10 days there has been a surge in the number of people getting bikes out of sheds and garages, dusting them off and thinking ‘I might need this.’”Steve Garidis, executive director of the Bicycle Association, added: “Cycling has a strategic role to play in local transport resilience – key workers are able to get to work in towns and cities without public transport or relying on lifts.”A number of bike shops near hospitals have been servicing NHS workers’ bikes free or at a discount, and Brompton Bicycle, the folding bike specialist, has lent 200 bicycles to staff at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in central London for a month to help them get to work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a692782b978339a3f98aae62de04ba4b75d5757e/263_220_3573_2145/master/3573.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5c03afa1e19e7a77fef1c9e272b196f 220w","title":"uk coronavirus lockdown rules what you can and cannot do","story":"Everything we know about the restrictions so farBritain is now in lockdown, and all non-essential businesses must close.But many questions remain after Monday night’s historic broadcast by the prime minister with many people unsure what they can and cannot do, or which businesses are essential and non-essential.

Schools, which are currently closed, have been asked to identify staff who are available to work in other areas during the crisis. The department may also temporarily reassign some SNAs to other roles commensurate with their existing duties.Fórsa, the trade union, said the department has confirmed that SNAs may be reassigned to other posts as part of a public service-wide mobilisation to tackle the virus and maintain essential public services. The plans allows for the temporary transfer of staff to critical roles for up to three months.Opposition parties, meanwhile, have called for clarity around contingency plans for the State exams. Sinn Féin’s education spokesman Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire TD said: “The situation is unsustainable and it is deeply unfair on students, their families and teachers to be operating under such stress and pressure.”Thomas Byrne TD, Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman, also called on the Government to “ramp up” supports for students attending disadvantaged or Deis schools who face bigger barriers to distance learning.DisadvantagedYouth Work Ireland also warned that the most disadvantaged students face losing out most from school closures and uncertainty over the State exams. The federation of 22 local youth services said disadvantaged students have less support at home to do educational work independently.“Schools were the first to close from March 12th but we have heard little about young people’s educational needs since then, there is clearly growing uncertainty about the feasibility of holding state exams and the UK have already made a call on this,”said Michael Mc Loughlin of Youth Work Ireland“Young people need clarity and for those in exam classes key decisions about third level and other career options depend on these exams.” The Teachers’ Union of Ireland said it appreciated that schools needed to remain closed in order to tackle the coronavirus threat. “The health and safety of our people, young and old, must always be the principal consideration,” TUI president Séamus Lahart said.“These are exceptional circumstances and we thank teachers and lecturers for their creativity, application and ongoing commitment to students. The public can be assured that educators will continue to do their work to the highest professional and ethical standards.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211145.1585072228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"commercially and socially nothing off limits in varadkar plan to stem coronavirus","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced a series of new measures - while also extending current restrictions until April 19th - in an attempt to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

The truth is that both may have to be revisited in the weeks and months ahead if the virus hits harder and for longer than the Government hopes.Desperate times, desperate measures. Like its counterparts across the world, the Irish Government will take on heaps more debt as it seeks to replace some of the income workers have lost, while also trying to keep the structure of employment in place in many companies through wage subsidies.The objective is not just to ease worries and hardship among businesses affected and people who have lost, and will lose, their jobs. The intention is to keep the economy ready to rebound when the crisis eventually comes to an end.Cost rocketingToday’s package will cost nearly €4 billion the Government is prepared for another €4 billion if needs be. The total cost of the coronavirus crisis – welfare, wage supports, increased health spending, tax receipts lost – is now rocketing far beyond the €10 billion that Government insiders were estimating only last week.The measures are for three months – until the beginning of the summer. What if the virus continues to rage then? We will do it again for another three months, says one person at the heart of the administration: whatever it takes. That would take us until September – a six-month shutdown.But what then? The National Treasury Management Agency has assured the Government that there are “no constraints” on its capacity to borrow money on the markets.This is because of the agency’s smart management and policy of prefunding its debt rollovers but it is also a testament to the strength of the public finances and the robust economy that finance minister Paschal Donohoe has steered. But if the crisis is a prolonged one, it will not be true forever. No country can keep ramping up its borrowing indefinitely without the bond markets taking notice. If the crisis doesn’t pass in the coming months, the Government’s ability to throw money at the situation will be diminished, and ultimately exhausted. That is inevitable.The second element of today’s measures – greater restrictions on social interactions and on commerce – are similarly based on some evidence, but also on hope. Social distancing is working – chief medical officer Tony Holohan said that the average number of close contacts among those with the virus has dropped from 20 to five – but the truth is that neither politicians nor scientists know if it working quickly enough. The big surge of cases has yet to hit the hospitals.No unnecessary travelSo all non-essential businesses are now being told to close, and people are being asked to stay indoors, allowed out for vital trips and for exercise, with no unnecessary travel. Gardaí will become more muscular with those not observing social distancing in public. The Government abhors the term lockdown, but this is certainly the greatest shutdown of commercial and social life the country has ever seen.The day after the UK government announced a sweeping shutdown – piling political pressure on the Government here to follow – Varadkar and his Ministers haven’t quite gone the full Boris, but it’s pretty close.Within Government there has always been significant concern about the long-term sustainability of a general shutdown. At the same time, it was a stage they knew we were likely to reach. The silent fear many have is that there aren’t many more shots left in the locker.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Mr Varadkar said all non-essential retail should close, and that people should work from home unless absolutely essential.He urged everyone to stay at home to slow the spread of Covid-19. “We believe we need to do more to flatten the curve. People should stay at home if at all possible – this is the best way to slow the virus.”Mr Varadkar said all cafes and restaurants should limit supply to takeaway only. Among other measures announced by Mr Varadkar are that all theatres, clubs, bingo halls, are to shut, and that all sporting events, even those behind closed doors, should be cancelled.He said people should only go to the shops for essential supplies, for medical or dental appointments, to care for others or to take physical exerciseHe also said non-essential indoor visits to other people’s homes should be avoided. “No unnecessary travel should take place within the country or overseas.Mr Varadkar said private hospitals “will act effectively as public hospitals” for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic.He said: “Private hospitals have agreed to do this on a not-for-profit basis. Public and private patients will be treated equally.”Single national hospital serviceMinister for Health Simon Harris said patients with Covid-19 will be treated for free in a single national hospital service. Mr Harris said all private hospitals will be public or run by the State for the duration of the pandemic. He said: “There can be no public vs private here.”The full list of essentialretail outlets is as follows:- Retail and wholesale sale of food, beverages and newspapers , Retail sale of household consumer products necessary to maintain the safety and sanitation of residences and businesses PharmaciesChemists OpticiansOptometrists Retail selling medical and orthopaedic goods  Fuel stations and heating fuel providers Retailers involved in the repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and bicycle repair and related facilities (e.g. tyre sales and repairs) Retail sale of essential items for the health and welfare of animals, including animal feed and medicines Laundries and DrycleanersBanks, Post Offices and Credit Unions Retail sale of safety supply stores (for e.g. work clothes) Hardware stores, builders’ merchants and stores that provide hardware products necessary for home and business maintenance, sanitation and farm equipment, supplies and tools essential for gardeningfarmingagriculture Retail sale of office products and services for iniduals working from home and for businesses Retailers providing electrical, IT and phone sales, repair and maintenance services for home.Support paymentsMeanwhile, the Government’s Covid-19 emergency support payment for people who have lost their job as a result of the pandemic will increase from €203 to €350, it was confirmed on Tuesday.Ministers also gave the go-ahead for a scheme which will see the Government pay 70 per cent of a workers’ salary - up to maximum of €410 per week - where the company agrees to continue paying the remainder of the salary. This is based on an average salary level of €38,000.Mr Varadkar said any person in a household who is asked to self-isolate because a fellow householder is showing symptoms is entitled to illness benefit at a rate of €350 per week. “The Covid-19 illness benefit will also apply to household members who are also being asked to self-isolate but do not have the virus themselves.”Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the country is “accosted by a pandemic that knows no border or boundaries”.Speaking at a Government briefing in Dublin, Mr Donohoe said: “This public health crisis is like no other. This economic crisis is also very different to others. It requires a different response.“This is because the very severe disruption has placed otherwise healthy businesses in jeopardy. Our citizens are under great strain.“The payment to employers is to encourage them to retain employees on their pay roll during this period. It is available to employers who suffer either a minimum of 25 per cent decline in turnover and inability to pay normal wages and other circumstances.“For the next 12 weeks such employers will be supported in the order of 70 per cent of an employee’s income.”Mr Donohoe added: “The Government has acted and will act this week assuming the passage of required legislation. “In these days and months of adversity the care and protection of our citizens is our abiding concern.”Schools closedThe measures are designed to try and offset the economic impact of the pandemic which has seen more than 140,000 people in the State lose their jobs.Earlier it was confirmed that schools, colleges and crèches will remain closed until at least April 19th .Two more patients died from Covid-19, the NPHET said on Monday evening, and a record number of 219 new cases were reported.There are now a total of 1,125 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Republic and six deaths, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.Meanwhile, “ten of thousands” of people are seeking to be tested each day, Dr Holohan revealed, and priority will be given to healthcare workers and the sickest patients.Dr Holohan said he was “very pleased” with the response of the public to the restrictive measures introduced 10 days ago, and said the aim was for “most of the people to comply with most of the measures most of the time”.Northern Ireland deathsMeanwhile the number of patients with coronavirus who have died in Northern Ireland has risen to five.

Singapore is banning all short-term visitors to the densely populated city-state after a surge of imported cases of coronavirus. Photograph: Roslan RahmanAFPGettyA combination of physical distancing interventions – quarantine, school closures and workplace distancing – is most effective at reducing the number of Covid- 19 cases, a study published today\u0026nbspsuggests.The research, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, is the first of its kind to investigate using these options for early intervention. The modelling study was carried out by doctors at the National University of Singapore.Lead author, Dr Alex R Cook, said: “Should local containment measures, such as preventing disease-spread through contact tracing efforts and, more recently, not permitting short-term visitors, be unsuccessful, the results of this study provide policy-makers in Singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of enhanced outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner.”The findings are especially relevant as the Government here introduces tighter controls on activity. It has restricted gatherings to four people and closed non-essential shops. Cafes and restaurants have been told to limit activities to takeaway food only. And existing measures have been extended until April 19th.Researchers established that, as a baseline, the median number of infections at day 80 of the outbreak was 279,000, corresponding to 7.4 per cent of the resident population of Singapore. They found that, compared with baseline and at different levels of infectivity, a combination of physical distancing interventions reduced the number of infections by between 78 and 99 per cent.Writing in a linked comment, Joseph A Lewnard and Nathan C Lo of the University of California, said: “Although the scientific basis for these interventions might be robust...political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group. The legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions.“Interventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss, disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations... Special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations, such as homeless, incarcerated, older, or disabled iniduals, and undocumented migrants,” they added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Restaurants facing closure urged to contact insurers on business disruption protectionCan I leave my house?

Photograph: iStockThe Government is planning a focused set of supports, including a wage subsidy, for creche providers in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. The supports, which the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) has told creche owners “are specific” to the sector, are currently being finalised. A letter sent by the Department to representative organisations and childcare providers on Tuesday, states that “within the new measures being announced by Government today, DCYA is finalising a wage subsidy element that will support you as employers”.It is not clear at this juncture how the wage subsidy will fit in with the enhanced €3.7 billion package of subsidies and benefits announced by the government today, which included a scheme to pay up to 70 per cent of a worker’s salary, up to a maximum of €410 per week.In its letter to the childcare sector, the Department wrote that it “believes that this new wage subsidy will best meet the short, medium and long term needs of the sector”. It wrote that “we believe that it is critical that staff of the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare sector are retained so that services to children can resume as normal after Covid”.Childcare sector representatives were told in the letter to “please await further details from DCYA that are specific to our sector”. Representatives of the sector may be briefed as early as Tuesday evening, the letter states.Earlier this month, The  reported that the Department had identified a funding shortfall of €12 million a year in the creche sector. The shortfall is caused by an anticipated significant drop-off in payments from parents to crèches on top of childcare subsidies.With measures closing crèches now extended into April, with a strong possibility they will be extended further, the sector in general is expecting cash from parent fees to drop off. Many crèches have already told parents they will not be charging them full fees for April.The fear in government circles is that a permanent capacity issue will emerge after the Covid crisis with significant numbers of childcare workers leaving the sector, and as they are often from overseas, perhaps leaving the country entirely.

File photograph taken at Dogs Trust: Fran VealePet owners should make relatively small adjustments to the routines of their animals, but there is no need to be alarmist or abandon dogs, according to vets and other medical authorities. Bray, Co Wicklow-based vet Pete Wedderburn said “dogs and cats cannot get coronavirus, but you should keep your dog two metres from other dogs and humans if you are out for a walk”, he said. In addition to not getting the virus, Mr Wedderburn said dogs could not transmit it to humans, in an aerosol fashion, through droplets. But he said social distancing should be extended to pets just in case a pet comes into contact with the virus through, for example, somebody sneezing on it. “Like any other surface, a dog’s coat can carry viruses back to a human, so there has to be a little isolation involved,” he explained. “Shampoo will keep a dog clean and will kill any viruses.” “If your cat is the kind that likes to visit two or three other homes during the day, think about keeping him indoors,” he said.Veterinary Ireland, the profession’s national representative organisation, said veterinary practices would endeavour to remain open throughout the Covid-19 crisis, but clients must phone first for an appointment. Those in isolation should not allow others to touch their pets, the organisation said.Dundrum pet food supplier Shane Walsh of Breffini House Pets said owners were making an effort “to do the best for their pets”. He said owners had been making sure they had enough supplies, “but not stockpiling”. Mr Walsh said there was “no shortage”.No evidenceThe ISPCA national animal centre in Longford and the DSPCA centre in Rathfarnham have closed to the public but animals are still being cared for at both centres. A spokeswoman for the ISPCA said there was no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats could spread coronavirus. “According to experts, Covid-19 cannot be transmitted from human to animal or vice versa. If your pet is touched by someone with coronavirus, then there is the potential that it can be spread, should someone else come into contact with your pet but the risk of this is extremely low,” spokeswoman Carmel Murray said. “We are asking pet owners not to worry about their pets,” she said. “It is important to interact with your pets as normal and to wash your hands regularly after contact with any animal.” The World Health Organisation has also reiterated there is no evidence that pets such as the family dog or cat can spread coronavirus to humans. It was commenting after publicity surrounding the Hong Kong dog which produced a “weak positive” in a test for coronavirus. The journal Science, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said the Pomeranian dog based in Hong Kong was found to have shown a “weak positive” in a test for the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19. However, WHO said coronavirus was transmitted primarily through droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing or a discharge from saliva and the nose. While pets were well known for their affectionate licks and runny noses, even sneezes, there were no known cases of such a transfer happening, the WHO said.ISPCA tips and adviceWhen out walking your dog, you should ensure they are kept on a short lead and under control at all times. Restrict contact with other people and animals and adhere to social distancing guidelines.Continue to exercise and play with your pets to alleviate stress in the confines of your garden.There are plenty of ways to keep your pets entertained such as putting their favourite treats in a Kong pet toy, using food puzzle toys, playing fetch or tug-of-war with their favourite toy.This is a good time to teach your pets some new tricks. The ISPCA would love to see your cute animal photos or videos.Avoid sharing your food or being kissed or licked by your pet and always wash your hands. It’s important you have sufficient pet food, prescribed medication or other essentials such as cat litter during self-isolation.

Photograph: Paolo AguilarEPAThe Government’s plan to bring home 135 Irish people stranded in Peru by the country’s coronavirus lockdown is awaiting the green light from the government in Lima.An email to those stranded sent on Monday morning by the Irish embassy in Chile said the timing of the proposed charter flight out of Lima “will depend on how soon our aircraft can be accommodated by the Peruvian authorities”.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told RTÉ on Sunday an agreement has been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a flight from Lima “in the next few days”. As well as Irish nationals dependants who are entitled to live in Ireland can also take the flight.The embassy email also said Irish authorities “will confirm details in due course for bus transfers within Peru from agreed locations to the military airport in Lima”. Only an estimated half of the 135 Irish, most of whom are backpackers, are currently in Lima with local travel restrictions preventing the rest making their own way to the capital.Repatriation will cost each traveller €400 but they will not be required to pay the fare in advance. Anyone diagnosed or showing symptoms of coronavirus, also know as Covid-19, will not be able to travel. At least six people have died of the virus in Peru with another 363 people confirmed infected.‘Not straightforward’Mr Coveney told RTÉ that organising the flight out of Peru “is not straighforward”. France and Israel are among the countries that have already sent planes to bring their nationals home. But thousands of other foreigner are still stranded in one of South America’s most popular tourist destinations.Peru has all but shut its land air and sea frontiers in response to the global pandemic. It announced a strict 15-day stay-in-doors quarantine on March 16th giving foreigners just 24 hours to leave the country. Many were left stranded and have since been reliant on their respective government to come up with a solution to get them out.On Sunday authorities closed fully the international airport in Lima. Now only flights bringing home Peruvian citizens or coming to evacuate foreign nationals can fly into the country and must land at the capital’s military airbase. Travellers stranded at the international airport were forced to make their way to the base in the hope of their governments sending planes to rescue them.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211201.1585075736!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what are the new measures announced by the government","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced a series of new measures - while also extending current restrictions until April 19th - in an attempt to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

save world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProfessor Didier Raoult, the maverick virologist who says chloroquine cures coronavirusWe could know within two weeks whether Professor Didier Raoult, the French virologist who heads the Mediterranean infectious and tropical disease institute in Marseille, will go down in history as the man who saved the world from Covid-19, or will be dismissed as an arrogant, misguided scientist who raised false hopes.Raoult administered a cocktail of hydroxycloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and azithromycin, an antibiotic used against bacterial pneumonia, to 24 Covid-19 patients.After receiving 600mg of Plaquenil (one of the commercial names for chloroquine) and 250mg of azithromycin for six days, three-quarters of patients tested negative for the virus, while 90 per cent of the control group who did not take the drugs still tested positive.On February 25th, Raoult spoke of Chinese experiments with hydroxycloroquine in a video titled “Coronavirus: endgame!” He hastily conducted his own clinical study and revealed the results in a second video on March 16th.US president Donald Trump apparently learned of Raoult’s experiment through a Twitter post by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. On March 20th, Trump wrongly claimed in a White House press briefing that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved what he called “the very powerful” drug chloroquine to treat Covid-19.Trump was corrected by Dr Anthony Fauci, a top expert on infectious disease and a pillar of the fight against coronavirus. But Trump persisted, tweeting the following day that “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE \u0026amp AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”Pharmacies in west Africa, where chloroquine has been used for decades to treat malaria, saw a run on the drug. The government of Morocco purchased the entire stock of chloroquine produced by the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi in Casablanca. Some French hospitals are administering Plaquenil out of “compassion” for the families of Covid-19 patients.Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice who has tested positive for Covid-19, “wants to trust” Raoult. Conservative senator Bruno Retailleau is exhorting the government to prescribe it more widely in French hospitals. Petitions supporting Raoult are circulating on the internet.The scientific community is ided. Raoult tested the drugs on a very small number of patients.“For the moment, there is no proof of the efficacy of this molecule on the disease, either for prevention or as treatment,” Dr Thierry Vial, head of a pharmacological centre in Lyon told, Le Figaro. “We have only preliminary data, which is encouraging and should be followed up, but is insufficient for systematic treatment of the illness.”Solid base“One cannot administer treatment without a solid basis, especially not chloroquine, which is not an ordinary medicine,” said Bernard Bégaud, professor of pharmacology at the University of Bordeaux.Pressure on the French government is such that health minister Olivier Véran announced at the weekend that chloroquine will be tested, with three other drugs, on 3,200 patients in the EU’s scientific programme Discovery, which is seeking a cure for Covid-19.Véran said he wants to know if Raoult’s study “can be repeated on a bigger scale in other hospitals, by independent teams”. This was necessary, Véran said, because “Never has any country in the world given authorisation for treatment on the basis of a study like this”.Véran also warned the public not to get their hopes up.“The history of viral disease is strewn with false good news, disappointments and reckless risks,” Véran said.Wariness of Raoult derives from his unconventional appearance, and from his reputation as a maverick. The television channel LCI described the hirsute professor as looking like “a druid in the Astérix comic books”.Raoult, age 68, was born in Senegal, where his father was a French military doctor. He moved to Marseille at age nine, joined the merchant navy at age 18, earned a literary baccalaureat at 20 and then went to medical school.Raoult shares a certain arrogance with Trump and Bolsonaro.“In my field, I am a star, worldwide,” he boasted to La Provence newspaper.“I don’t give a damn what others think. I am not an outsider. I’m streaks ahead of the others.”Like Trump and Bolsonaro, he is also a climate change denier.Yet millions of people are placing huge hopes in Raoult’s study. A high-ranking French civil servant, now retired, who is following the story closely, believes professional rivalry is interfering with the search for a cure.Raoult “is unanimously recognised by leading professors” but “annoys the establishment”, the source says. The fact that Raoult forced the French government to include chloroquine in European clinical tests “proves the strength of his de-Gaulle-like conviction”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211096.1585071291!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus leading irish medic in us castigates lunatic in charge over delays","story":"March 20th, 2020: US president Donald Trump threw a tantrum over a question on peoples fears of Covid-19 at a White House press briefing. Video: The White House\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Garret FitzGerald: ‘The irony is Trump supporters paid the price for his mistakes.’ Photograph: Eric LukeThe United States is showing every indication it will outstrip China in coronavirus cases, and is already “not far behind them”, according to one of its leading medics Prof Garret FitzGerald.The US is about to experience a surge in cases in a scenario where President Donald Trump delayed taking decisive action, and squandered early advantage he had secured by default, added the University of Pennsylvania professor of pharmacology and therapeutics.Referring to Trump as “the lunatic in charge”, FitzGerald said that by restricting travel from China for largely xenophobic reasons he may have bought time, but subsequent delays on testing and restrictions undermined this. “He continues to send mixed messages,” FitzGerald said.Trump’s failure meant the most effective strategic response came at state level, with key governors dictating necessary pace. FitzGerald cited New York Times analysis showing that awareness was behind in other states, a disparity between red (Republican) and blue (Democrat) states, with the latter scaling up action. “The irony is Trump supporters paid the price for his mistakes.”DeathsHe questioned how many extra deaths would be due to delays and misinformation. The president has continued to describe chloroquine drugs used to treat malaria and other conditions, as “game changers” in the fight against coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, when there was no proper study to show they work, noted FitzGerald, who is originally from Ireland.In response to misleading advice from the French health minister Olivier Véran, FitzGerald has a letter in the latest issue of the research journal Science, highlighting how he wrongly issued a warning on painkillers – notably nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on which he is a global authority.His letter had gone viral through social media channels. “So that is good. It was a silly thing to say at several levels,” he said, “In a sense, it was like Trump’s ignorance of science.”Véran confused matters by claiming on Twitter that anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or cortisone could aggravate coronavirus infection – when people taking NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop doing so for fear of increasing their coronavirus risk.He advised people to take paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead to treat a fever but this only added to confusion, given it is also an NSAID.Flawed advice was being compounded by fake news and irresponsible behaviour, FitzGerald said, citing reports that four young people taking NSAIDs for sports injuries were in ICU in Cork.It added up to “a fusion of unreality” and was a wake-up call for the public on “why pervasive ignorance of science comes at a price. Trump is the ultimate metaphor as far as that is concerned.”Healthcare workers were displaying remarkable dedication and bravery in a similar way to Ireland, while the scientific community had been mobilised on rapid development of vaccines new drugs and apps to monitor and advise people. But there were specific dangers in the US scenario.There were long delays before rigorous separation was implemented. Its health system was fragmented, varying between best healthcare and none. There was rowback on Obamacare in a system where too many had no health insurance and “uneven sick pay”, motivating many people to go work.FitzGerald said there was a lot less social cohesion in the US compared to Ireland but stressed he was outlining a worst-case scenario.He is scaling down research at his facility while helping a national effort to ramp up coronavirus-related research and share vast amounts of data in a harmonised way – all done remotely.This will involve work on hundreds of thousands of patients post-infection, to identify key contributing factors to spread and infection. This had to be done in a safe way not to impair front-line clinical work.As he is in a higher risk age group he will not be on the front line but expected to be “called up” to deal with patients “back from the front line”.He added: “We’re very fortunate. We see what’s coming. We can work remotely, and have sick pay and health insurance. We’re at the elite end of the vulnerability spectrum.”Those most at risk were vast numbers of people with no health insurance – separate to those who were homeless.FitzGerald feared Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US expert on infectious disease who is helping to lead the national response, would be fired by Trump.Republican business interests were pressurising the president to allow people go back to work. “Fauci won’t accept that.

The Government will not get away with throwing them to the wolvesMy local policeman dropped by last week and told me that farmers and smallholders are worried that people might soon start stealing their eggs, chickens and even this season’s lambs. Though the village in which I live is only 20 miles from Downing Street, this is a different world – one in which those with their finger on the pulse realise the desperate plight faced by the self-employed thanks to the coronavirus.There is no doubt that the Chancellor’s financial support package is unprecedented in size and scope. The announcement that the government will pay up to 80 per cent of workers’ wages up to £2,500 will certainly allow many firms to go into hibernation and should keep people in work. It has been welcomed by the trades unions and many well-established businesses. Equally, the loan offer that has been made to companies which meet certain criteria will certainly suit some successful concerns. For example, this week I heard of a small independent pub chain which is keen to borrow £5 million in order to buy up distressed competitors. For enterprises like this one, the economic crash is an opportunity and the government is there to help them.When one looks at the overall picture, however, the measures introduced by Rishi Sunak #do not address some very basic questions. On a practical level, I am not convinced that the banks will be able to process large numbers of applications in short order. At the same time, many firms will worry about taking on yet more debt and will decide that company liquidation is the only way out. It is a sad inevitability that there will be many business casualties.But aside from these criticisms, one of the most pressing problems surely lies with the 11 million people who do not earn regular wages. Some of them run their own limited companies. Others act as sole traders. Many, of course, work on zero hours contracts or are employed seasonally. Together, this group makes up one third of Britain’s workforce yet, so far, little has been done for them.If somebody in this bracket runs out of cash, the fact that there is a VAT referral or a mortgage holiday in place will be irrelevant. And while the statutory sick pay that is available to these people is to be welcomed, the £94-a-week on offer simply isn’t enough for a family of four to live on. With all of this in mind, my best guess is that by the middle of April millions of people will be unable to afford sufficient amounts of basic food and household goods. They need help from the Chancellor.In the past there was a culture, particularly among the self-employed, of saving for a rainy day. But after years of low interest rates and the impossibility for those aged under-40 of owning their own property, it has evaporated. The concept of thrift is an alien one to younger generations. Many live not just a hand-to-mouth existence, but one that is based upon hire purchase agreements and mounting credit card debts. Time is now the enemy of these people, who work in a huge variety of sectors from hairdressing to computer programming.The Government’s key priority today is, of course, the health of the nation, followed by the economy, but I don’t think enough thought has yet been given to the societal impact of this situation or, indeed, to law and order. If the Government is perceived to be helping big corporate entities while throwing to the wolves the 11 million-strong army of men and women described above, the reaction could be very ugly. The idea of wages still being paid to somebody who works for a mothballed company, and a family living next door whose main earner is self-employed not being able to buy staple foods, is unthinkable.  In the middle of a national emergency, something has to be done to make us believe that we really are all in this together. The only solution that I can see that could be implemented quickly to help the 11 million people who do not have a fixed income would be the introduction of helicopter money, the policy which results in cash being distributed to iniduals directly. If £1,000 was paid every month for the next three months into the bank and building society accounts of the adult population, the cost to the country would be £120 billion. This is a vast sum but it could, in fact, be a small price to pay if it maintains national unity in our troubled nation. The Irish government is already implementing such plans. It won’t be long before Donald Trump does the same in America. Rishi Sunak must follow suit. Otherwise, I fear my local farmers will be proved right.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

When I returned from my trip around Central Europe, I isolated myself (in a borrowed apartment away from my mother and sister) since the number of cases of Covid-19 (in Germany for instance) were similar to Italy in the beginning.Around 10 days ago I started feeling some symptoms, exactly the same time as my father – who travelled with me from Brussels.I was feeling tired, had shivers, a sore throat and coughed. My dad experienced the same symptoms, but much more intense and with a fever. In Sweden you can not test yourself for Covid-19 unless you\u0027re in need of emergency medical treatment.Everyone feeling ill is told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for Covid-19, but it’s extremely likely that I’ve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances.Now I’ve basically recovered, but – and this is the bottom line – I almost didn’t feel ill. My last cold was much worse than this! Had it not been for someone else having the virus simultainously (sic) I might not even have suspected anything.Then I would just have thought I was feeling unusually tired with a bit of a cough. And this it what makes it so much more dangerous.Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don’t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups.We who don’t belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility – our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others.Please keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and stay at home to slow the spread of the virus. And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need.Ms Thunberg initially isolated herself as a precaution having been on trains, but then started to develop symptoms, she added in a video interview with the New Scientist.If it wouldn\u0027t have been for my father getting it at the same time, and much more intense than me, I might not have noticed it, she said.She urged people to practice social distancing whether you feel ill or not, in line with widespread guidance which aims to prevent transmission from person to person.The Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven, has said people have great inidual responsibility to stop the spread of coronavirus.

On Monday evening it was also announced that people should only leave their homes to go to work where it is absolutely necessary. But who is classed a key worker?The Department of Education has published a full list of roles that the Government considers to be “key”.So here’s what we know so far.Key workers are people whose jobs are vital to public health and safety during the coronavirus lockdown. Because their work is so vital, the Government is keen to ensure that they are able to carry out their jobs with as little restriction as possible. This includes being able to put their children in school and use necessary transport links.Food chain workers, including those involved in production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of goods.Postal workers, those required to run the justice system, religious staff, as well as those responsible for managing the deceased, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.Local and national government workers in admin roles “essential to the effective delivery” of the Covid-19 response or delivering essential public services, including payment of benefits.Police and support staff, Ministry of Defence civilian staff and armed forces personnel, fire and rescue staff, and workers responsible for border security, prisons and probation.No, they should be at home and observing social distancing.Vulnerable children, including those with a social worker, and pupils who get special needs support will be able to stay in school. Children with at least one parent or carer who are identified as critical workers by the government can send their children to school if required.Single parents who are key workers will be entitled to a school place.Some roles within the NHS, such as dental nurse, whose work is not at the frontline of treating the coronavirus may still be considered key workers. However, this may depend on your practice and the type of work you do.Clearly, there is a grey area over key workers, and it may be hard to enforce restrictions if children of non-key workers are still turning up at school. But the Government is asking people, in extraordinary times, to do everything they can to protect as many lives as they can. If you do not need to take your child to school because your job is not essential to public health and safety, please try to stay at home.The Government is not intending to restrict access to the transport system, though there are a number of closures, particularly in London. However, if you are not a key worker, try to avoid travelling by public transport.Not only does this free up space for vital workers, but you are less likely to catch and spread the virus. If you can, walk or cycle to work. If you don\u0027t need to travel, don\u0027t.A Downing Street spokesman said employees should speak to their employers to check whether they should come into work if they are unsure whether they are a key worker. Employees should speak to their employers. People who can work from home should, but those who are central to the coronavirus effort, we believe, have been named as key workers, they said. The spokesman said the Department for Education had been working closely with the Office for National Statistics in compiling the list of key workers, but could not say how many children were expected to turn up at school next week.Earlier in the day, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary said that under 20 per cent of children will be in school, and that the scientific advice still stands that operating at that level will still be overwhelmingly effective in slowing the spread.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarkets take action ensure social distancing staff prepare","story":"Supermarkets have taped off areas in store and put up protective screens for staff after worrying pictures at the weekend showed shoppers crammed together in queues to buy food.After the Prime Minister ordered a UK-wide lockdown, some of the only shops are open are those which sell food. In order to stop the spread of coronavirus and temper crowds, shops across the country have put queueing rules in place.There are also discussions going ahead about pre-picking a weekly shop to reduce the number of people in the aisles as home delivery slots are still scarce. Other supermarkets are asking for the contactless spend limit to be raised to £45.Here is what each supermarket is doing to increase social distancing.The supermarket is allowing fewer people than usual in store. Those who are in shops will see tape marking out the correct distance to stand behind or in front of the next person in the queue.Staff will also be given plastic screens at tills for protection.They will will be closing every other payment point in supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol filling stations.The supermarket is also asking customers to use cards at tills and cash at self-service checkouts where they can.The upscale supermarket has introduced new two-metre marshalls in stores who will tell customers to stand at a greater distance from each other.It is also limiting customer numbers, introducing ‘safe distance’ floor signage, installing protective screens at checkouts, putting in place additional security and encouraging contactless shopping.Shop managers will use their judgment on customer numbers and when the shop is at capacity to manage social distancing will operate a one in, one out policy. Waitrose will still dedicate the first opening hour to elderly and vulnerable customers and those caring for them and NHS staff will continue to be given priority checkout service.There will also be fewer checkouts. In order to enable those working in the shop to maintain social distancing where two checkouts are back to back one will close.Special protective visors are also being ordered and will be available to staff if they wish. New lift instructions stating that only one customer or family should occupy a lift at any one time.A drive to encourage more customers to shop in a “cashless and contactless” way to prevent unnecessary contact.  Staff will guide customers where possible to use Waitrose Quick Check self-service technology and contactless card payments. Waitrose \u0026amp Partners is also part of discussions to increase the contactless limit to £45 to help customers make more use of contactless payment.The shop has put protective screens in place to protect staff from infected droplets.It has also put together essential \u0027food boxes\u0027 in order to reduce the amount of contact people have with others. These cost £35 for a family and a vegetarian option can also be ordered. They contain meat, eggs, pasta, vegetables and other staples.Tesco has put tape on the floor of its shops to demonstrate safe distances at which to stand and is limiting the number of people allowed in shops.To allow staff to rest and stock to be replenished, all store daily opening hours will shorten slightly to close at 8pm every day, from this Friday until further notice.  Clear screens will be installed at all Aldi checkouts in the UK to protect colleagues and customers.  Aldi is also advising its colleagues and customers to observe Government advice on social distancing in stores.Lidl will install checkout protection screens across all its stores in Great Britain. Christian Härtnagel, CEO at Lidl GB, commented: “The safety of our colleagues and customers continues to be a key priority for us, which is why all of our stores here in Great Britain will be fitted with protection screens at checkouts.“We hope that this additional safeguard will help to provide extra reassurance for those both working and shopping in our stores.”Last week, the supermarket announced that it was creating up to 2,500 new store jobs to provide necessary additional support to its workforce and customers.The wholesaler has put cones in place to enforce socially-distant queuing and has limited the numbers of those allowed in store.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"supporters draconian action must bear mind unintended effects","story":"My family is lucky, in this crisis and in this weather, to live in the country. From our house is a wide view across a river, with fields and woods rising the other side. The woods are at that lovely moment when the trees are budding but not yet in leaf, so one can see the forest floor beneath as it greens up faster than the canopy above.As I lay on the lawn yesterday, reading stories about panic-buyers and people who are not obeying the rules of social distancing, I recalled the line in the hymn about a place where “Every prospect pleases and only man is vile”.As I watched, however, a dozen fallow deer, frightened by something in the larger wood, broke out of it and galloped across the field towards the copse beyond. As the deer approached it, something alarmed them there too. They froze, and then started turning back and forth indecisively. After a bit, as if by joint reflection, the herd calmed down and moved, in slow and orderly fashion, into the second wood.It struck me that most of the human herd is behaving a bit like those deer at present. It is not evidence that we are vile. We shouldn’t be blaming each other too readily. It is simply that it takes a bit of working out how to answer need and avoid danger. Take “panic-buying”. Yes, a few greedily grab great piles of stuff, but most of us buy more of something which we believe might become short (hence the old slogan “Hurry, hurry – while stocks last”). That is not wrong.Take the failure to maintain social distance last weekend. It is entirely natural, and healthy, to seek space to take the air. As an inidual decision, given the current need for psychological refreshment, it is even positively good. The problem arises when lots of iniduals independently make the same decision. A beautiful National Trust park usually affords lots of room, but if you arrive there in the time of Covid-19 and find the car park crowded, you have unwittingly added to a health hazard. Morally, it is like being in a traffic jam – each driver stuck in one is not usually blameworthy for being there.It is easy to see how people who crowded into parks, such as those pictured here in Richmond Park, unwittingly contributed to a health hazardLast night, Boris Johnson announced a much fiercer clampdown to deal with these difficulties. The public are now extremely restricted in where they can go. His argument is one from dire necessity, and it would be bold to say it is wrong. But those calling for draconian action also need to remember its unintended effects. If, for example, the Government had suddenly “locked down” London last week – as was rumoured – such a measure would itself have caused chaos. It could have turned hundreds of thousands of people into refugees, overcrowding road and trains, increasing infection risks as it did so.The Government sensibly did not close the city. With these latest restrictions, there must be a real danger that people will find them impossible, get disillusioned and defy them. The difficulties in care homes, for example, are now truly formidable. So is the situation of parents whose children are unexpectedly home all day.We, the herd, do need guidance, but if we become blindly dependent on rigid orders, we might panic blindly too.The wartime comparison with the coronavirus does not work in every way. But in one respect, it does. Unlike in normal politics, there has to be an overriding common purpose. Does it make sense, therefore, to form a coalition government, as some are beginning to suggest? Given the urgent need to beat the virus, does the normal, legitimate role of the Opposition disappear? Would it help national unity if the Labour Party were sharing responsibility and decisions?Jeremy Corbyn should certainly not have any role. As the defeated, outgoing leader, he no longer has a personal mandate. It might not be idiotic, however, for Mr Corbyn’s successor – most likely Sir Keir Starmer – to be treated differently.The analogy with the coalition government formed under Winston Churchill in 1940 is inexact. In that case, the existing Conservative government had failed in its war aims, and there had not been a general election since 1935. Churchill had a moral duty and a political need to cast the net wider. In 2020, the Tory majority is new and robust.Nevertheless, it might be good to find some way to bring the Opposition in on what is happening for the duration of the crisis. It could be slightly informal, given that the duration (unlike the Second World War) will probably be a matter of months, not years.If Boris Johnson were to invite Sir Keir (or whoever) to join the fight rather than stand on the sidelines, it would be a big gesture. The risk would be that it would split Labour – and therefore the new leader would probably refuse. Labour’s gain by accepting, however, would be that, at a stroke, it would have shown itself to be a party capable of government once more.The coincidence of the virus biting and the spring coming leads me to take deeper delight than usual in how the season changes. On Sunday afternoon, our dog turned over on her back and wriggled herself luxuriously down the grassy slope for the first time this year. For us, this is normally just a pleasingly comic moment of spring.

The Government will look again at these measures in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows this is possible.All non-essential shops are closing, excluded are food shops, pharmacies, corner shops, hardware stores, petrol stations, pet shops, post offices, banks, newsagents and shops inside hospitals.Parks will stay open, but gyms including outdoor gyms, play-parks and kiosks will close. As will all places of worship except for funerals.All gatherings of more than two people are going to be banned except for members of your own family. And these measures are in place for three weeks starting immediately.Police will have power to issue on the spot fines of £30 for meeting without good reason.Takeaway and delivery services may remain open and operational and online retail is still open and encouraged. Postal and delivery service will run as normal.Retail and public premises remaining open must:The Government has ordered all of the businesses in the table below to close, unless there are exceptions, which are all listed. There is some uncertainty about businesses not listed, such as building sites. The emergency piece of legislation is wide-ranging, and you can read it in its entirety below, but here are the key points: From Friday 20 March, schools and nurseries will be closed until further notice, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.But in order for key workers to get to work, schools had to remain open in order for their children to be cared for.The Government published a list of key workers in the early hours of Friday whose children will continue to be cared for at school amid the coronavirus pandemic.But there has been chaos in schools with beauticians and museum staff arriving claiming to be key workers while firefighters and microbiologists were turned away.The Prime Minister said that exams would not go ahead in May and June, meaning GCSEs, A-levels and SATs are on hold, but the aim is for children to get their results in the summer possibly using their predicted grades.Supermarkets up and down the country have seen scenes of apocalyptic panic buying (see video below).Britons have been told not to panic buy and shop as they would normally shop.But, people were ignoring the advice as queues snaked around supermarket car parks, so supermarkets have introduced rationing on grocery products. The hysteria has prompted some chains to introduce elderly and vulnerable-only shopping slots.Shoppers will also be limited to a maximum of three of any grocery product and a maximum of two on the most popular items such as toilet roll, soap and UHT milk.The Government has made assurances that shops\u0027 supplies will remain fully stocked and under the new emergency Coronavirus Bill, supermarkets would be forced to tell ministers about any supply chain issues.If people must leave their homes to purchase food, they should limit social contact with other people, the Government said. And some chains like Waitrose have introduced a maximum number of people allowed inside at any given time.Areas of close social contact such as pubs and clubs are high-risk areas for transmission of the virus. Ministers will be able to prohibit or restrict events and gatherings, and to close premises, if the public health situation deems it necessary the notes to the Bill say.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has placed quite a hefty emphasis on limiting smaller gatherings to counter the spread of the virus.Restaurants also fall into this category and a number of chains - including McDonald\u0027s, Costa Coffee and Nando\u0027s - who had been offering a take-away only service closed their doors indefinitely ahead of the Prime Minister\u0027s announcement.Dozens of stations on the London Underground network have been closed following the outbreak of Covid-19.Transport for London says the plans were designed to allow critical workers to make essential journeys and 40 stations which do not interchange with other lines will remain closed on the Tube network.Here is the full list of the closures: Grant Shapps, Secretary of State for Transport, has previously hinted railway services could be axed because there was no point running ghost trains.Buses in the capital will be reduced and people are being urged not to use public transport for anything other than essential journeys and the Waterloo and City line and Night Tube services will not run from Friday.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: I\u0027m urging Londoners to only use public transport for essential journeys. Everyone should follow this and the other advice to help keep themselves and each other safe.But this advice was not being adhered to, as the Tube, buses and trains were still packed on the first morning of the lockdown. As a result the British Transport Police was TfL said it would also be gradually reducing the frequency of services across the network, to provide a service for critical workers to get to where they need to - ensuring that remaining services are not overcrowded.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the Government will underwrite the entire nation\u0027s wage bill. Anyone who cannot work because of the coronavirus pandemic will be paid 80 per cent of their salary by the Government, capped at £2,500 per month, under an unlimited rescue package unprecedented in the history of the British state.Mr Sunak also announced four major financial pledges. Government-backed loans worth £330billion - equivalent to 15 percent of GDP - will be made available to support businessesExtending the business rates holiday to all businesses in the hospitality sector and funding grants of up to £25,000 for smaller businessesThree-month mortgage holiday, meaning those affected by coronavirus will not pay a penny towards their mortgageOn Tuesday, Mar 17, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British citizens were advised against non-essential foreign travel for 30 days.That refers to anywhere outside the UK.In a Commons statement, he told MPs: Based on the fast-changing international circumstances today I am announcing changes to FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) travel advice.UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lockdowns in various countries.The FCO will always consider the safety and the security of British nationals so with immediate effect I\u0027ve taken the decision to advise British nationals against non-essential travel globally for an initial period of 30 days and of course subject to ongoing review.A mass gathering in the UK is considered to be a meeting of more than two people - unless they are from the same household.This means that going to a family member\u0027s home for a Sunday roast is now banned.Big events such as elite sport and concerts have long been abandoned.  People classed as vulnerable have been told to drastically change the way they live their lives by social distancing. The Government is strongly advising them to significantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and family if possible.Those who fall into this category are: Underlying health issues can be largely defined by anyone who is instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds, according to the Department of Health.These conditions are set out in the box below.Pregnant women are the most recent group to be added to the list, although the Government has stressed this is purely a precautionary measure as experts are early in our understanding of this virus.Although the limited evidence suggested there were no complications in pregnancy, for many infectious diseases there is a small but appreciable additional risk and as this was a new virus there was no evidence for people in early stages of pregnancy.Infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general and that is why we have taken the very precautionary measure while we try and find out more, the Government\u0027s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said, adding that he would rather be overly cautious at this stage and admit it was overkill at a later date than underplay it and get it wrong.Those considered extremely vulnerable have been told to shield themselves from society for 12 weeks. Around 1.5million people were written to to inform them they are part of this group and should not leave their homes until at least Monday, June 15.Social distancing is staying 2 metres away from anybody you do not live with. The Government has set out measures you can take to reduce the social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus.Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is pragmatic, the Government said, and the advice is likely to be in place for some weeks.Anybody with coronavirus symptoms - a new, persistent cough or a fever - should self-isolate.Those living alone should do so for seven days, but those living with others should self-isolate as a household for 14 days. Where possible - this should mean not leaving the home at all, and getting groceries delivered to the property.Criminal trials are to be put on hold as part of the ongoing efforts to delay the spread of coronavirus.In a statement, it was announced that the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett - the most senior judge in England and Wales - has decided no new trial should start in any Crown Court unless it is expected to last for three days or fewer.As a result, cases longer than three days that were due to start before the end of April will be postponed.The announcement came after pressure mounted on the Government to make clear its strategy for courts, amid growing concerns about the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on court business.The statement said the impact of the public health emergency on the operation of the courts has been under constant review, and that criminal trials pose particular problems in a fast-moving situation because of the involvement of many participants including the judge, jurors, defendants, lawyers, witnesses and court staff.All cinemas and theatres are now closed.The move comes after theatres in the West End and around the UK closed before the decision was made for them.The Society Of London Theatre - which represents hundreds of theatres in the capital including the National Theatre, London Palladium and London Coliseum - and UK Theatre said the decision was not taken lightly.The Royal Shakespeare Company also announced its three theatres will close following the Government\u0027s advice.Prisons in England and Wales are to go into lockdown with restrictions on inmates movements and a ban on all visits by family and friends to combat the coronavirus.The new rules mean inmates will be confirmed to cells for 23 hours a day and only allowed out to shower, use pay phones and to exercise.Any movements such as exercise will require prisoners to abide by the two metre space rule required by the Government to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection. Prison staff will communicate with prisoners via notes under cell doors.The moves follow representations from Prison Officers’ Association (POA) that visitors and prisoners were still mixing and inmates were exercising in groups.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/22/18/coronavirus-shops.jpg","title":"coronavirus primark shops closed shut hmv john lewis new look","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.More than 37,000 staff affected by latest move to slow down spread of Covid-19Primark announced it will close all 189 of its stores as retailers across the UK began locking down in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus.The fast-fashion business said the measure would affect some 37,000 staff but committed to paying employees their contracted hours for the next 14 days.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt came as a host of other high street shops, including John Lewis, HMV, Topshop\u0026nbspand New Look, also announced they were closing stores.Online shopping websites will not be affected by the shutdown.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus -- and where has it spread?Arcadia Group, the company that owns fashion brands including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Miss Selfridge, had already closed its stores “until further notice” from 4pm on Friday.“All store staff remain employees during this time and will be paid their normal pay for March plus any outstanding overtime payments, after which we will review this situation and will be keeping our store teams updated,” the firm said in a statement.Ikea shut its 22 UK stores the same day, along with TK Maxx, Clarks and several other brands.New Look closed its stores at 5pm on Saturday and said it had extended its refund policy to 90 days.

The mother of one employee told The Independent she was concerned that Dexters\u0027 approach could put the health of her family and the wider public at unnecessary risk.The estate agent\u0027s founder and chairman Jeff Doble said he believed the criticism was unfair and that much of the work Dexters does cannot be carried out from home.He said Dexters was in the process of winding downon Tuesday but pointed to the fact that the government\u0027s lockdown announcement was only yesterday giving little time for firms to prepare.On Monday night, the prime minister told people not to go out apart from in very limited circumstances including attending medical appointments and buying food.\u0026nbspThe latest intensification of social distancing measures means people should only go out for work where this absolutely cannot be done from home.Anyone caught breaking the rules faces a fine of up to £1,000 from Thursday, when a bill containing the new legislation to deal with coronavirus is expected to become law.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company had claimed it was “uniquely well-placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible during this crisis”.“Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government’s current social distancing guidance),” finance chief Chris Wooton told staff in a letter.However, the company said on Tuesday morning its shops would close their doors.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRishi Sunak said on Friday that workers on zero-hours contracts would be covered, as long as they were paid through PAYE. But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case. Self-employed workers, who are not on PAYE, are not covered at all and will have to claim benefits if their work dries up and no new government measures are enacted.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”They are taking the fight to the University with the help of the Independent Workers\u0027 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to demand they are paid throughout the shutdown for the hours they\u0027ve been working over the past three months.More details on government support for zero-hours workers will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who at present have even less financial support if they can\u0027t work during the pandemic.Greg Howard, a rider for food delivery service Deliveroo, says his recent decision to self-isolate cost him around £400 a week.\u0026nbspIt is stressful. I don\u0027t know how long this situation is going to go on for, nobody does. It does put a bit of fear and a bit of trepidation in me, says Howard.Deliveroo has set up a hardship fund for its riders who cannot work but there have been problems accessing it because riders must provide a doctor\u0027s note. The government announced in the Budget that workers could obtain one via the NHS\u0027 111 helpline but this service is not yet available.With millions of people now in enforced isolation, drivers involved in food distribution are recognised as crucial for the functioning of the economy but many feel they do not have the support they need.Courier services often do not employ staff directly but treat them as independent contractors, leaving the onus on the inidual to ensure they are safe, well and not at risk of spreading the virus.\u0026nbspRiders are doing all they can to protect themselves and others but they are being put in a difficult position, as Howard explains: Deliveroo have announced they will fund up to £20 the purchase of hand sanitisers, hand gels, soap, that kind of thing.

We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks... But right now the network is performing quite well.”His comments came after a series of outages in the US, UK and Europe related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Last week, major phone networks and internet providers in the UK suffered widespread outages and down time due to a significant increase in web traffic.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The issue is expected to worsen over the coming weeks, as containment measures intensify and more people stay at home playing online games or streaming shows and films on the internet. Schools across the UK have also shut down, meaning lessons will be carried out using remote working apps.In an effort to ease the burden on internet infrastructure, Amazon Prime, Netflix and YouTube all announced plans to reduce the quality of streaming on their platforms.Despite concerns of more outages, BT offered assurances on Friday that its broadband network has the capacity to cope with the surge in demand.“The UK is one of the world’s most advanced digital economies, so we overbuild our networks to compensate for our love of high-definition streaming content,” BT’s chief technology officer Howard Watson wrote in a blog post.“The Covid-19 outbreak is causing changes to the way our networks are being used. We’re monitoring those changes carefully to make sure we can respond rapidly if needed.”There have so far been more than 340,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world, resulting in close to 15,000 deaths.The sharpest rise in cases in recent days has been in the US, which overtook Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea over the last week to be the third worst affected country behind China and Italy.More than 100 million Americans have been ordered to stay at home, with eight states currently under lockdown.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The mother of one employee told The Independent she was concerned that Dexters\u0027 approach could put the health of her family and the wider public at unnecessary risk.The estate agent\u0027s founder and chairman Jeff Doble said he believed the criticism was unfair and that much of the work Dexters does cannot be carried out from home.He said Dexters was in the process of winding downon Tuesday but pointed to the fact that the government\u0027s lockdown announcement was only yesterday giving little time for firms to prepare.On Monday night, the prime minister told people not to go out apart from in very limited circumstances including attending medical appointments and buying food.\u0026nbspThe latest intensification of social distancing measures means people should only go out for work where this absolutely cannot be done from home.Anyone caught breaking the rules faces a fine of up to £1,000 from Thursday, when a bill containing the new legislation to deal with coronavirus is expected to become law.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company had claimed it was “uniquely well-placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible during this crisis”.“Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government’s current social distancing guidance),” finance chief Chris Wooton told staff in a letter.However, the company said on Tuesday morning its shops would close their doors.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For Mike had been quiet as a mouse.Could the appointment of a worker director in the wake of the scandal at his Derbyshire warehouse – you may recall that searches on the way out contributed to some staff getting less than the minimum wage for their time – have worked the oracle?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCould it be that Mike had become Saul, changing from bad boss to an apostle of commercial humanity on the road to Damascus (or at least to Derby)?Guess not. The Institute for Business Ethics had best put the Christmas Party invite on ice. Time to mothball that Everlast hoodie. It’s not something you’d want to be seen wearing in public. Or even in lockdown, at least this morning, because there was Ashley all over the news insisting Sports Direct stores were as essential as Sainsbury’s, because what everyone needs in the middle of a global pandemic is a pair of brand new Lonsdale sweatbands.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThey would remain open, Ashley insisted, to keep the public fit and healthy in their homes. Plus, it’s Nike Air Max week.In making that decision, Ashley managed something I’d previously thought impossible. For a brief moment, he made Michael Gove look like something other than a slimy snake oil salesman.I know. That’s still a bit like the Joker doing something so stupid and terrible in Gotham City that even the Penguin is moved to admonish him.But wait! Performing a hand brake turn that even The Sweeney’s Jack Regan might feel good about, Mike changed his mind.Sports Direct stores would close up, after all, leaving the online operation to pick up the slack and flog the home exercise equipment (surprise surprise, Ashley and co are pushing that hard).It doesn’t quite absolve him from doing something so unbelievable crass and stupid as to claim Sports Direct stores were essential services in the middle of a global pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rest assured, if you want your Covid-19 bogeyman, the gammon-faced publican is there for you.\u0026nbspHis latest in a lengthening list of unfortunate pronouncements was his suggestion that if his staff – the same who have done so much to make his business successful, and him rich beyond his wildest dreams – should be offered jobs at supermarkets, then good luck to them.Will done, Timbo. You’ve done what needs to be done to secure your position. Mike’s just not in your league.

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case. Self-employed workers, who are not on PAYE, are not covered at all and will have to claim benefits if their work dries up and no new government measures are enacted.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it.

The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”They are taking the fight to the University with the help of the Independent Workers\u0027 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to demand they are paid throughout the shutdown for the hours they\u0027ve been working over the past three months.More details on government support for zero-hours workers will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who at present have even less financial support if they can\u0027t work during the pandemic.Greg Howard, a rider for food delivery service Deliveroo, says his recent decision to self-isolate cost him around £400 a week.\u0026nbspIt is stressful. I don\u0027t know how long this situation is going to go on for, nobody does. It does put a bit of fear and a bit of trepidation in me, says Howard.Deliveroo has set up a hardship fund for its riders who cannot work but there have been problems accessing it because riders must provide a doctor\u0027s note. The government announced in the Budget that workers could obtain one via the NHS\u0027 111 helpline but this service is not yet available.With millions of people now in enforced isolation, drivers involved in food distribution are recognised as crucial for the functioning of the economy but many feel they do not have the support they need.Courier services often do not employ staff directly but treat them as independent contractors, leaving the onus on the inidual to ensure they are safe, well and not at risk of spreading the virus.\u0026nbspRiders are doing all they can to protect themselves and others but they are being put in a difficult position, as Howard explains: Deliveroo have announced they will fund up to £20 the purchase of hand sanitisers, hand gels, soap, that kind of thing. We can\u0027t get hold of that, nobody can get hold of that.He believes that Deliveroo has been better at helping riders through the coronavirus crisis so far than some other gig economy companies, but there is much more to do.Alex Marshall, 35, couriers \u0026amp logistics branch chair of the IWGB union, is pushing for firms to cover riders\u0027 pay if they can\u0027t work.He adds: These companies need to take some responsibilities for workers that really could be integral to society to keep moving forward in these really troubling times.They can\u0027t continue to just say that these people are self-employed and totally in control of their own sanitising and everything. That responsibility is too much for one guy on his motorbike with a box on the back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

While hantavirus does refer to a dangerous family of viruses, they are not comparable to the new coronavirus and are nowhere near as dangerous.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHantavirus is not new at all, having been known about for decades and potentially been active for even longer it does not easily pass between humans it can only be caught by consuming the bodily fluids of rats or mice and the world is much better equipped to deal with it, including holding vaccines.The false messages appear to be attempting to seize on fear around the outbreak of coronavirus to encourage people to share yet more worrying information, and are likely to cause unnecessary anxiety in people already concerned about pandemics.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe WhatsApp messages often make explicit reference to the new coronavirus, suggesting that it could follow in a similar manner.When the whole world is still suffering from Covid-19, here comes another virus... one seen by The Independent reads. The \u0027hanta virus\u0027 has been detected in China, mainly caused by rodents. One already died and few tested positive.The story about a death does appear to be correct. Chinese state newspaper Global Times reported that one man had died on his way to\u0026nbspShandong Province on his way to work.The tweet of that story has now been shared nearly 15,000 times on Twitter alone, and has probably been screengrabbed and spread across the world as an image. While the report of a death is true, any suggestion that it is similar to the outbreak of coronavirus is unfounded for now.Hantavirus is no doubt a very serious family of diseases. Symptoms can be very severe and it has been known to cause deaths.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus culture from rooftops, windows and balconies Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeA rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeThe viruses taken together are a family of viruses that are spread by different rodents, and cause a variety of different disease syndromes. Infection can lead to one of a number of different syndromes, which each have their own rodent hosts and\u0026nbspare geographically specific: though hantaviruses are found across the Americas, Europe and Asia, the regions lead to different syndromes and symptoms.Infection usually comes from consuming the urine, faeces or saliva or a rodent, though more rarely it can come from being bitten. People are at particular risk if they live in dusty areas with rodent infestations.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They haven’t’A surge in coronavirus cases in Hong Kong has revealed the limits tough social distancing can achieve in the fight against coronavirus, and could mean the UK having to leave tougher restrictions in place for longer, The Independent has been told.In Hong Kong, Singapore and China, authorities have pursued a strict lockdown policy that has in recent days started to be relaxed as numbers of infections dropped, but the latest figures have shown a possibly worrying resurgence in infections.In Hong Kong the number of confirmed coronavirus cases\u0026nbspincreased by 225 in just 10 days to a total of 357, on March 23.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe city of 7 million was an early adopter of social distancing, closing schools and keeping people at home, but has seen many cases imported as people return from overseas.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsIn Wuhan, ground zero for the pandemic, the toughest lockdown has now been lifted and China was able to manage only five days before reporting its first domestic case of coronavirus again.Similarly in Singapore and South Korea there have been dozens of new cases imported to the country in recent days with rising numbers of domestic infections.A second wave\u0026nbspof infections had been predicted by experts advising the UK, US and French governments, with research by Imperial College London suggesting that without a vaccine, restrictions on normal life may have to be continually “switched on and off” as cases rise to prevent NHS services being overwhelmed.Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told The Independent the conclusions that second waves of infection would happen now seemed obvious and inevitable.He said: “We have got a virus in the population and it is going to keep doing what it does. It is as simple as that. It is not going anywhere and even if it does it will only come back. People are behaving as if the Chinese have beaten it. They haven’t.“Even if those countries are able to eradicate it, the virus will only be imported again.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe said this had happened in all pandemics back to the 14th centruy, when the\u0026nbspBubonic plague was brought to the UK by a ship: “It is inevitable, we live in an interconnected world”.Dr Clarke said the figures emerging in countries across Asia suggested second waves of coronavirus were happening. “All outbreaks start small, with one person.”For the UK he said this showed the modelling was right, adding: “We will presumably come out of a lockdown situation, have some period without restrictions but have to end up imposing them again”.Andrew Tatem, professor within geography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, said: “The lessons we can next learn from China are about which restrictions can safely be lifted, when, where, for whom, and what still needs to stay in place. While Wuhan suffered a major outbreak, the vast majority of people in China did not contract the disease.“This means that the risk of further outbreaks remains very high, especially with so many cases now outside of China and importation becoming a new problem. Making sure that the country doesn’t suffer repeated outbreaks requiring new lockdowns will be a major priority for authorities in China, and the rest of the world should look carefully to see what happens and learn from it.”Sian Griffiths, emeritus professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and co-chair of the Hong Kong government’s SARS inquiry, said it was welcome news that new cases had reduced dramatically in Wuhan but she added: “Obvious concerns for public health authorities will be the re-emergence of infection and careful surveillance will be essential , not least of the mild and asymptomatic cases which are more difficult to count.”She added: “The second wave of cases in Hong Kong coincides with the large numbers of students from schools and universities returning at the end of term . They have all been asked to quarantine for two weeks to avoid further spread, as some of the recent positives can be identified as imported cases.“Following a cluster of cases in the bar area, Hong Kong has banned the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants however they still remain open and the stay home message is more advisory and less draconian than in the UK.”She said the government there had now reintroduced testing for travellers returning to Hong Kong, home working for some groups and cancelling exams due next month.Prime minister Boris Johnson has said the UK lockdown will be reviewed after three weeks. He has previously said the country will be able to “turn the tide” within 12 weeks if everyone follows the rules.The Imperial College research published earlier this month suggested the restrictions could last for up to 18 months without a vaccine or drug that successfully treats the virus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Although with some cities, including nearby El Alto, now seeing nightly battles between police and protestors, it would seem not everyone is following the new laws quite to the letter.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“Except for food supplies, we’re not going out at all,” says Molly, a marketing executive, from the three-room apartment. “If we caught the virus here and needed treatment, we’ve no idea what would happen. We hear the hospitals are already being overwhelmed.”They have repeatedly, they say, contacted the British embassy begging for help. Each time, they are told to stay put and hold tight. But more than a week since the country’s borders were sealed off, no help – or even suggestion of help – has been forthcoming. They feel, they say, abandoned.“I just want to be home,” says Molly. “It doesn’t feel safe here. The curfew is supposed to be in place until 4 April but our neighbour says the rioting will only get worse the longer it goes on.”Their desperate plight reflects that of hundreds of thousands of people stranded abroad as country after country across the globe shut their borders and airlines dropped flights – often without any notice – in a bid to prevent the pandemic.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said last week that up to a million Brits could be stranded abroad, unable to return for possibly months.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailYet for, Harry and Molly, their attempts to get home\u0026nbspare perhaps indicative of the problems experienced by many UK citizens overseas: a feeling of being let down by embassies which were supposed to be there for them.Whenever you\u0027re in England, you always feel that if anything goes wrong in a foreign country, ring the embassy and they\u0027ll sort it right out, says Harry, a scaffolder by trade. But... I have found, not only was it hard to get in contact with someone, but since I have, the updates are brief, they\u0027re not personal and they don\u0027t fill you with a lot of confidence.The couple – who met while studying at the University of Nottingham – had been in South America for seven months on their once-in-lifetime trip.Last Monday, with foreign office advice still suggesting it safe to be abroad, the couple set out on a three-day excursion to Bolivia’s remote salt flats.But within hours of setting off, they received news that next-door Chile was cutting off its borders for a period. And, by Tuesday – with the couple a day-long drive from Uyuni, the nearest city – that advice from the British government had also changed: it now said nationals should avoid all non-essential overseas travel.“Safe to say, that put a dampener on the excursion,” says Molly, who is originally from King\u0027s Lynn. “That’s really when we decided we needed to get home – but it took until Wednesday to get back to Uyuni.”From there it was another day of travel for them to Santa Cruz\u0027s Viru Viru International Airport,\u0026nbspthe country\u0027s biggest, where they were told all planes had been grounded.“We were showing staff all these flights on Skyscanner,” says Molly. “They were looking at them going, ‘These flights no longer exist, I’m sorry’.”Acting on advice that the land border with Brazil remained open, the couple headed there,\u0026nbspwith three Australians they had met at the airport –\u0026nbspin the hope they could catch a flight to Europe once across the border.“It was an eight-hour journey with five of us plus luggage in a four-seater car,” says Molly. “It was the worst journey of my life. We went in a store on route and asked for Coca-Cola. The guy passed us a bag of cocaine. ‘No, no. Just a drink’.”At the border, they were turned away. After several hours queueing, gun-toting guards said all crossings had been stopped. When the couple tried to show officials they had connecting flights to Europe booked from an airport just six kilometres away, they were told it did not matter.When they tried to argue the point, one guard unclipped his gun. Clips on Brazilian news showed the chaos as hundreds tried to make the same pleas.“It was the scariest moment of my life,” says Molly. “We left pretty soon after that.”Now back in La Paz – which the British embassy said would be the most likely destination for a rescue flight – they are sitting each day, hitting refresh on the government’s website, hoping to be saved. So far, without any luck.“It feels like we’re prisoners,” says Harry, from Bishop Stortford. “We have nothing to do but are just trying to fill our heads with as much knowledge about the situation as possible so we can try and be prepared.They have, they say, no real medical supplies. “Well, we have a thermometer in a first aid pack so, if one of us gets it, at least we’ll know,” says Molly.Responding to the criticism that they had done little to help, a spokesperson for the foreign office said: We recognise that any British people currently overseas may be nervous about the impact of coronavirus on their travel and their health.“We are in close contact with travel providers and our international partners to provide support to those British people affected by ongoing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.”But the statement was of little comfort to the couple.We know we\u0027re not the only people in this situation, says Harry. We know there are others far worse off. But we wanted to share our story, I suppose, to show what we feel is neglect by the government. Not just to us but to thousands of people also trapped in different parts of the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The company has an annual turnover of £1.8 billion.In contrast to firms such as Costa – which has promised to carry on paying full wages for at least eight weeks – Mr Martin also suggested staff would receive no more than the government stipend.I can completely understand it.

I know this is incredibly difficult, this is an emotionally fraught time and a difficult one,” he said. “Wherever possible if there could be contact through social media, or non-physical contact then that should carry on.”Family orce lawyers have previously raised concerns around social distancing measures, with one telling The Independent there was widespread “confusion” about what arrangements between couples might mean.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsClarifying his comments in a second interview on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Gove said: “On another broadcast on Good Morning Britain, I was asked specifically about orced or separated parents and whether or not children could move from one household to another.“One of the things that is clear is that if it is the case that children are under the age of 18 need to move from one parent’s home to another parent’s home, that is allowed.“Within the context of all us seeking to reduce social contact, that is allowed. I was not clear earlier on that broadcast.”On his Twitter account, the Cabinet Office minister added: “I wasn’t clear enough earlier, apologies. To confirm – while children should not normally be moving between households, we recognise that this may be necessary when children who are under 18 move between separate parents. This is permissible and has been made clear in the guidance.”Government advice, released on Monday evening after the prime minister’s address, states: “Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents’ homes”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to the government’s advice, the answer is yes.”The cabinet minister also said that non-essential shops – such as clothes and toy companies – could continue to work through online deliveries, after being forced to close their high street operations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is a real kick in the teeth at this time when people are being laid off and struggling to get by”.\u0026nbspThe new rules are intended to help consumers by banning daily overdraft charges which the regulator says can be expensive and confusing. These will be replaced with an interest rate that makes overdrafts easier to compare with other borrowing such as credit cards.But the FCA said in January it would be “keeping a close eye” on high-street lenders after many of them introduced new overdraft interest rates of around 40 per cent.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB have all announced rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Nine ways you can support the NHS during the coronavirus pandemicHackers attempt to steal sensitive information from WHOLive: UK joins fifth of entire world living under coronavirus lockdownNew York has ‘exhausted every option’ to tackle coronavirusMP Nadia Whittome returns to care work during coronavirus outbreakBoris Johnson’s coronavirus lockdown speech watched by 27 millionLloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent.The regulator has warned that it could introduce a cap on overdraft fees if banks do not offer competitive rates. It launched a review after finding that in some cases an unarranged overdraft had cost consumers 10 times more than borrowing the same amount through a payday loan.Baroness Altman, the former pensions minister, also told The Times: “I hope that banks will reconsider the egregious overdraft charges, to help their customers weather the storm.\u0026nbsp“The self-employed, those who are away from work due to illness or isolation, or those waiting for benefit payments, will all need help,” she added. “If they are charged such huge rates then banks might be considered to be taking unfair advantage of the system.”\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People can be seen hanging laundry. Children play. One man eats noodles. Another smokes a cigarette.Chinese officials and some public health experts have credited the draconian confinement measures on a city of 11 million, and much of Hubei province, of which it is the capital, with slowing the spread of the disease and turning the tide of infection across China.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther countries, including Iran, Italy and the United States, are struggling to manage their outbreaks.\u0026nbspBut even as the number of new reported cases stops in Wuhan, people in the city remain suspended in an isolated new normal.Residents are forbidden from venturing out of their homes even to buy food, which must be delivered.

But there has to be some common sense.We must all do our best to follow the Government’s advice to leave a -metre gap between ourselves and the next person when outdoors.Yes, a bunch of irresponsible idiots think they’re invincible and are choosing to flout the rules. Flocking to beaches and parks to sunbathe in large groups is plainly not sensible.Despite dire warnings that we are only a fortnight behind Italy where so many have died, large numbers of people here are still not getting the message.Most Brits are keen to do what’s right.Butnot enough of us take heed then we face restrictions the like of which have never been seen before.The stakes really are that high.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.TO the thousands of retired doctors and nurses who answered the Government’s call to arms: The Sun salutes you.Instead of thanking their lucky stars that they escaped before the virus hit, these everyday heroes ed to the NHS front line to save lives.If the Government wants more to follow where these pioneers have led, it must make a superhuman effort to support them. Right now, that means getting each and every one of them the proper protective clothing they need.We understand that’s easier said than done: Supplies are limited.

In normal times, everyone is busy, at work all day.We rarely see even the lovely couple who live across the landing. The streets below teem with workers, always in a hurry.Now these streets are empty. Our neighbours stay indoors, self-isolating.But we still see each other more than ever before, on the way to supermarkets for Silver Hour or grabbing some fresh air. We stand well apart, chat about the only subject in town and exchange offers of help. The City of London has become a village again.We receive tip-offs about loo roll delivery times or surprise consignments of hand gel and wet wipes at the nearby ­pharmacy.WhatsApp support groups have sprung up, advising on contactless payment via online bank accounts or how to spend your time indoors. Laptops are a leline.A frail friend and neighbour politely declines my offer to pick up her prescription.“I’m inundated with calls,” she says. “Everyone’s so kind.”Not everything is so fraternal.There is real anger at the hoarders in our midst — at people like the couple who arrived home with trolleys piled high and a new freezer to store three months of food.The Sun picture of a ­Teesside shopper with  loo rolls hit a nerve, along with the scumbag who made £, selling them at £ each to pensioners.So did private cardiologist Dr Mark Ali, who — says The Sunday Times — made £.million in a week flogging coronavirus test kits for £ a go — three times the cost price.Most employers are doing the decent thing, using help from Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep workers on  per cent pay.But others are seizing the chance to slash their payroll, risking a huge spike in ­unemployment once the crisis is over. Some household-name ­companies have not covered themselves with glory.EasyJet effectively abandoned passengers stuck in foreign parts with no way home until Sunak stuffed taxpayers’ cash down their throats.My we and I escaped from Cyprus last week on one of the last ­scheduled flights before hotels and airports were shut down.A lot of EasyJet over-s passengers feared being stranded with nowhere to stay.This crisis has hit Downing Street hard, with ministers and officials working -hour days, almost hot-bedding in No as they struggle to cope with fast-changing events.London, the UK epicentre of contagion, is in lockdown as the death toll spurts faster than tragic Italy’s at this stage of the spread. Did Boris get it right  We’ll soon know.It is interesting to observe the reaction of dferent age groups to this pandemic.Schoolchildren are understandably scared by the headlines. Old folk, some of them war babies, are more fatalistic.But some in their s and s are flagrantly ignoring advice to self-isolate.They are the least likely to die of this bug but risk putting thousands of fellow Brits in an early grave.A few months ago, the UK was split by what now seems a harmless spat over Brexit.There were Remainer black “jokes” that Britain would rejoin the EU once all we Brexit fogies had popped our clogs and the Eurosceptic virus had been eliminated.Covid- may be culling the elderly, but at least it’s impartial.They applaud their “friends” in Russia, China and others even more extreme who will take advantage of crippled Western economies, especially in Europe.Once we are through this pandemic, the next truly momentous battle will be between the West’s cash-strapped but creative “free spirits” and the authoritarian iron fists of the former Soviet era. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Go to thesun drhilary to ask yours or simply use the form below.Britain’s most respected doctor will also be answering questions in an online Q and A session with The Sun’s Executive Editor Dan Wootton from ­Wednesday at youtube thesunnewspaper.Today he tackles some of the most common ­questions about ­coronavirus.Q: I think I might have corona­virus, should I go to my GP or call   A: Neither. If you have symptoms that are typical of the virus, you should stay at home and self-isolate. We are asking people not to contact  or to go to see their GP as these services are currently very stretched. Drink plenty of ­fluids, take paracetamol and get plenty of rest.Q: I suspect I have coronavirus, should I get tested A: At the moment testing is only reserved for seriously ill patients in critical care in hospital, those admitted to hospital with respiratory infections and for healthcare workers, such as doctors, nurses and paramedics. We don’t have enough tests for everyone and evenwe did, it would not change the way most people are treated.Q: If I suspect I have coronavirus, should I inform everyone I’ve been in close contact with  A: You only need to inform people who you have been in contact withyou have been admitted to hospital and are confident, via testing, that you have the virus.Q: Should I wear a mask, scarf or gloves to protect myself  A: Psychologically you may feel safer behind a mask or scarf but there is no evidence to suggest this stops the virus being spread. Many are suitable for dust and pollution but the virus particles are microscopic.In fact, some people might argue that you may touch your face moreyou are wearing a mask or scarf.If you use gloves on areas that could have become contaminated, such as an ATM or petrol pump, you will need to then throw those gloves away and this means you are going to get through an awful lot of gloves in one day.This is why it is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot water or use hand sanitiser with a minimum of  per cent alcohol when you are out and about. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" A: Yes and no. Our natural instinct is to hug or embrace our loved ones andyou are all at home together and no one is showing any symptoms you can carry on as ­normal.Butsomeone in the ­family is self-isolating you must keep a physical distance. The same goes for elderly relatives or those in the at-risk group. You must keep your distance from them evenyou are not showing signs of having the virus.Q: If I have symptoms that aren’t typical of coronavirus, such as a runny nose, sore throat, tickly cough and headache, could I still have the virus A: Of the , tests that have been carried out on people with symptoms that could be corona­virus, more than , have proved negative, so most people don’t have the virus but still need to isolate just in case.Q: Is it safe to take ibuprofen while you have coronavirus A: Ibuprofen is a commonly used medicine that can be bought over the counter. But it is also an anti-inflammatory, which works by stopping inflammation in the body. With this virus, we don’t want to do that.The best response to the virus is to produce inflammation so the body can fight it. So it is better not to take ibuprofen but to use paracetamol instead to help bring down your temperature.Q: Will vitamin C help my body to fight the virus A: In theory it supports the immune system and won’t do any harm, but there is no strong evidence that taking even large doses of vitamin C makes much dference with this virus.It is important to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet as well as taking a vitamin D supplement, which is always useful in winter anyway. It’s important to also get out in the garden or on your balcony to absorb a few rays of sunshine, without burning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q: I have symptoms, but how do I self-isolate A: You need to stay indoors. If friends or family deliver food, they must leave it on the doorstep for you to bring in yourself. You will need to self-isolate for seven days.Butyou live with others, all members of your household will need to self-isolate for  days.You need to stay in your own room. You must eat your meals in that room and sleep alone. Use your own crockery and glassware and make sure you wash them up immediately after use. Clean hard surfaces after you have used them.Ideally you should use separate bathrooms. If you have to share a bathroom, you should use it last then wipe down surfaces with a bleach-based product. Use separate towels and toiletries.Keep a safe distance — a minimum of two metres — apart from other household members.Q: At what point should I seek medical advice A: If you are having breathing dficulties or chest pain which is getting worse, or your temperature is very high and not coming down with fluids and paracetamol, that is the time to seek further medical advice by phoning  or going on their website. If you are really breathless, phone  — but this is only for severe cases.Q: I have an outpatient appointment but should I avoid going to hospital A: If you don’t have symptoms and have an outpatient appointment, such as a scan, it is OK to go to hospital as long as you keep your distance from other people and leave the hospital as soon as your appointment is over.For those in the at-risk group, it is best to stay home. In both cases, contact your unit first and seek advice. If you have cancer, it is important to continue with treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and those units will be more conscious than ever to isolate those patients when they come in and to get their treatment done quickly so they can get home as soon as possible.Q: Which people are classed as at-risk A: These are people who are ­normally advised to have the seasonal flu jab. They include those with underlying medical conditions. These include:Q: And who is classed as being high risk A: People in the high-risk group include those who have had an organ transplant and are taking immunosuppressants, currently ­having treatment for cancer and people with conditions such as HIV.Q: Is is possible to get corona­virus twice A: Currently we don’t know enough about this virus to say for sure that you can’t get it twice but it is unlikely.If it turns out to be like seasonal flu it’s possible there might be another round of virus next winter, as we don’t know yet how strong people’s immunity will be.We will know more in the future and soon a test will become available to show whether someone has had the virus and has developed immunity.Tap to see where COVID- is near you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My body ached severely, I felt so heavy and was sweating with a fever.Things were not looking good. I struggled to sleep due to the intense body aches – I never felt anything like this before.Doctors have warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, has said that those who lose these senses should self-isolate immediately - evenyou have no other symptoms.They added that the eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.In a statement, the docs said: Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas.We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus.Its thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Ryan Van Waterschoot, who ended up in hospital for  days while he fought Covid-, is one of those who lost his sense of taste and smell.The -year-old said: I didn’t think I was going to make it out of the hospital. I thought it was the end of the road for me.Mr Van Waterschoot, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, first felt unwell on March  when he lost his sense of taste and smell and, and went from feeling tired to not being able to move in just one day.As his condition worsened, he called the doctors and was immediately advised to call an ambulance on March .His temperature had soared and he was taken to Peterborough City Hospital where he was put on an isolation ward and needed oxygen for five days.He is now at home recovering but has warned people to stay at home and follow government advice.Some people may experience brain fog, also known as mental fatigue, as another symptom of coronavirus.Its not been officially looked into as a symptom but its another indicator that those who have experienced the illness have reported experiencing.Thea Jourdan, , said she didnt experience a cough or fever - instead her introduction to Covid- began with a tickle in her throat and a dull headache,.The mum-of-three, from Hampshire, says she then started to experience brain fog.She told the Daily Mail: Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever.But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep.Another woman, who had recently recovered from Covid-, told the Huffington Post that she too had experienced the unusual mental block before her symptoms worsened.Christy, from Seattle, said her illness started with a multi-day fever that progressed into sinus congestion, a headache and a debilitating “brain fog” that made it impossible to focus.She added: “It’s not just a cold.  I’m pretty healthy and not old , and it kicked my a**.”Another symptom that coronavirus patients have reported is feeling extremely fatigued before symptoms develop.According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to  per cent of those hospitalised with Covid- reported exhaustion and fatigue.Chiara DiGiallorenzo, , has been battling Covid- since March , said her illness started with a fever and fatigue.But she knew it was more serious than a flu when she developed a tightness in her chest that left her short of breath.Chiara, from Miami, told HuffPo: “It is not the flu,” adding that many people who get it are left “fighting for air.”Linda Carr, , from Hethersett, Norfolk, said that around a fortnight ago she lost her sense of taste and smell.She told the Mail she then developed other symptoms, adding: I felt very sick and terribly fatigued.

Only critical workers should be using public transport and no one . Ignoring these orders will put lives at risk.“We will continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can so that those critical NHS staff and other workers can get to work, but as our staff themselves fall ill or have to self-isolate we are simply not able to run a full service.The majority of people are playing their part and avoiding travel, but more people need to stop travelling immediately to save lives.”In a letter, she said: “London’s NHS workers need to use the Tube, but too many Londoners are flouting the rules and turning it into a petri dish for coronavirus.“Sadiq Khan should use the police to bolster the dwindling number of Tube staff to stop non-critical workers making unnecessary journeys, implement crowd-control measures, and check which employers are forcing staff to commute.He was also bashed by the Tory candidate for mayor Shaun Bailey.The former youth worker told The Sun: I called for the Congestion charge and ULEZ to be suspended so that key workers, including NHS staff, wouldnt be penalised for driving into work in London to avoid public transport.Butthe trains are packed, I urge the Mayor to restore more services to allow key workers to make essential journeys safely.”Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and the London Major are set to speak later on.Today Michael Gove suggested the Government could act to get more trains running.He said: I know that the Transport Secretary, the Prime Minister and the Mayor have been talking in order to ensure we can have the drivers in place to make sure we can have a service that limits the need for people to be crammed one against the other on the Tube.The conversation is going on at the moment to have the best possible Tube service.This morning an NHS nurse was just one to share a photo of a packed Tube, saying: This is my Tube this morning. I live in zone  and work in a zone  hospital.I love my job, but now Im risking my health just on the journey in !@SadiqKhan put the Tube service back to normal so we can all spread out, or @BorisJohnson start policing whos getting on.

Our nation will never be the same again.So many features of our society will be transformed, from the way we are governed to where we work and how we entertain ourselves.The state will be far bigger and more powerful. Free enterprise will no longer flourish. Welfare dependency, even for businesses, will the new norm.Our social lives will reshape around the home, with travel firms, cinemas and restaurants feeling the burden, while key workers like our NHS heroes will replace narcissistic celebrities in our adoration.And in practice, we will live under a socialist system, where the government has effectively nationalised the entire economy.That dramatic change will be a legacy of the extraordinary measures adopted by the Treasury in the face of the coronavirus challenge.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has recently announced a range of policies that amount to the biggest bailout in history, including a £ billion rescue package for businesses, a massive expansion in the social security system, and an unprecedented subsidy of up to  per cent for wages in the private sector.This vast intervention is on top of the Budget a fortnight ago, in which Mr Sunak announced the biggest increase in public expenditure since the s, as well as a colossal £ billion capital investment fund for infrastructure projects.Great Britain PLC has now been the subject of a takeover by the state.Mr Sunak’s phenomenal splurge is more radical than anything even Jeremy Corbyn proposed at the last election. And the clock will not be turned back.Having tasted economic control on an epic scale, Whitehall and Westminster will be reluctant to give it up.After all, the post-war socialist expansion of the state by the - Labour Government was not reversed for decades, despite long periods of Conservative rule, until Margaret Thatcher came to power in .Recent nationalisations like those of the railways and airlines will remain in place. The public sector will continue to dominate.But the new socialist Britain will be poorer and less dynamic.The services sector, which currently accounts for  per cent of the economy, will take decades to recover from the shutdown imposed by the coronavirus panic.With the collapse of so many businesses, especially in the hospitality trade and retailing, mass unemployment will cast a long shadow.At the same time, record levels of government debt will require huge levels of borrowing and higher taxation.The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis will probably also make our nation more inward-looking and less enthusiastic about globalisation.The barriers that are now going up around Europe will remain in place, while Britain is likely to impose stronger border controls.Immigration, currently running at over , new arrivals every year, is bound to plummet, especially when shrunken firms cannot claim to need cheap foreign labour.The international travel industry will continue to struggle once the crisis is over, with clients fearful of health risks.With reduced activity, it seems doubtful that the third runway at Heathrow Airport will ever be built.Ruined airlines and cruise companies will look back on pre-corona days as a golden age, though domestic tourism may receive a boost from the greater number of Brits holidaying at home.The Covid- catastrophe has exposed how fragile our inter-connected world really is.In an attempt to reduce our vulnerability, Britain is likely to become far more self-sufficient by strengthening our domestic supply lines, rebuilding our manufacturing base and bolstering the agricultural sector.Similarly, our dangerous dependence on Chinese contractors for everything from nuclear power to broadband technology will end.Future governments will be reluctant to reach the kind of deal that Boris Johnson recently did with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to play a key role in the expansion of the G network.One key result of the Covid crackdown has been to show businesses that it is perfectly possible for a signicant number of their employees to work from home, thanks to the web.This trend is bound to gather pace even when the crisis has passed.The huge increase in home working will herald a long-term decline in the office, for so long one of the symbols of our sophisticated civilisation.And the consequences of such a change will be enormous.Commercial property, which is estimated to be worth around £ billion in Britain, will drastically fall in value.Commuting by road or rail will become far less common, leaving trains emptier and roads less congested.For the first time since rail privatisation, passenger numbers will drop signicantly.Nor will there be any justication for huge, expensive transport projects like the £ billion HS rail link or the vast proposed new £ billion Lower Thames crossing, linking Kent and Essex by road.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.In a culture dominated by home working, expensive city living will lose much of its appeal.Already overblown, property bubbles in fashionable hotspots like London and Manchester could soon burst.Yet, while the urban housing market runs into deep trouble, coastal and rural regions may well see a revival.Will Margate be the new Islington On a more profound level, the shock of the present crisis will leave us more oriented towards our homes and family le.We will be less obsessed with eating out, more focused on home entertainment. TV streaming services will grow rapidly. Cinema chains will shrink.Hardly any area of British le will be free of the covid revolution’s impact.Throughout the academic world, there will be more respect for valuable, practical subjects like science, engineering and medicine - and less for academic pursuits like media studies.In politics, there is likely to be less partisanship and more consensus, as highlighted by the remarkable praise heaped last week on Mr Sunak by the TUC for his bailout.In a shell-shocked country, trying to recover from economic meltdown and social lockdown, there won’t be much time for isive fads, poisonous identity politics or invented victimhood.Shrieking about safe spaces will sound like pathetic self-indulgence in a society where thousands are likely to have died from the Corona killer.What could be beneficial for Britain is a fundamental rethink about the values of our age.The health crisis has graphically revealed who really matters when it comes to the le-and-death crunch.As the death toll mounts, it is not the property speculators, lawyers, quango chiefs, and hedge fund managers that keep our country going, despite their vast financial rewards.It is the NHS staff, the care home workers, the retail assistants, the emergency services personnel, the lorry drivers and the shelf-stackers, many of whom have limited earnings.Perhaps in the new Britain forged by the coronavirus, we will lavish more on our carers, and less on our celebrities.Out of the current despair, we may come to recognise our real priorities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One teacher got an email last night from a parent asking us to mark workthey sent photos through.You just think, ‘We are quite busy at the moment!’There are long term worries too, what do we do at the end of this The kids have missed an entire term. And what happens to Year Sixs  Do they not go to secondary school A few of my children have asked what’s happening and it can make you feel quite helpless.”Peter Booth, , from Leicestershire is a self-employed plumber running his family business GV Booth, with help from his -year-old dad – who manages the company’s office work.He says: “There’s so much confusion from last night.I’m in quite a few WhatsApp groups and there were a lot of arguments when some guys said they’d have to keep working and others disagreed.Some who know they can’t survive on £-a-week will insist on working still.It’s very hard for Boris Johnson, but we just need some guidance.I’m now only doing emergencies myself. Today I’ve got an -year-old man that’s got no heating or hot water — so it’s urgent.It’s going to be very much down to interpretation.Then the other thing is my main merchants has closed today for  hours to decide what to do.SoI go to this job today and can’t get the parts for the older man, he may have to wait more than  hours without hot water.I’d be happy to sit at home today, with my phone on, thenI get an emergency I can plan it properly and go.You can also make sure your kit is all disinfected, your hands are washed, butyou’re rushing between jobs then you might become a bit lax.”Sam Oxley, , is a senior sous chef at Italian restaurant Forza Win, in Peckham, South London. He says: I was so relieved after the restaurant shut down and we began work straight away to create a new delivery menu.It was a relief to have something to concentrate on.A lot of suppliers, now that there are no restaurants to supply, are also in trouble, so the knock on effect has been huge.We had planned to launch a new service straight away, delivering a menu including fresh pasta and sauces that could be put together and cooked at home.However, the dficult decision was taken that we needed a week out first to take stock, ensure we were social distancing, and were all healthy ourselves before starting.But everything is changing so rapidly. With heavy hearts following Boris’ lockdown announcement last night, the decision has now been made not to go ahead with deliveries at all.These are extraordinary times, and while it’s shown the worst in some people, with stockpiling, it’s shown the best in others.Our customers have bought hundreds of pounds worth of vouchers to show their support to us.It’s so touching to see how much customers appreciate the meals we cook.I can speak for every small business when I say: your support means so much.Dr Murray Ellender, , is a London-based GP and co-founder of eConsult.He says: “There are pregnant doctors who are now going to have to come back to work.It’s really dficult – we need all the workforce we can get on the frontline.Yesterday was really busy and we had a number of doctors cancel last minute.Either they were unwell or had family members with symptoms which meant they had to self-isolate, which is not their fault.My colleague Clare Gerada, who had Covid- and has since recovered, is now helping out with patient care but not seeing the patients face-to-face.Those doctors who’ve had it can go back to work feeling a bit more confident they’re not going to get ill. Clare’s a super doctor!The key message I’m trying to get out to all patients is that they can do their bit, too.Across the UK, GPs have , practices which deal with a million patient contacts a day. Soit’s not urgent, don’t contact us.If you think you need to see a GP, don’t necessarily think you have to come into the building.Cases we saw yesterday and dealt with remotely were things like patients with rashes or eczema, female patients with urinary tract infections, even things like mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression.We’re seeing a lot of patient anxiety, understandably. But those cases we can manage remotely.Go on your practice site rather than calling your GP – we need to keep phone lines open for elderly patients who arent online.Shannon Summerfield, , is a support worker with not-for-profit Dimensions in Cardf. The organisation offers help to those with learning disabilities, autism, challenging behaviour and complex needs.She says: I thought the lockdown was the right decision - it’s just quite worrying because it’s something we’ve never seen before.We’re going to be giving all our ladies’ families a call today as they all probably quite upset about the news.We’re going to make sure those in our care are well looked after and supported as best we can.A few of the ladies here are quite vulnerable and are very high risk. I think it’s best they stay in the house.We’re just trying to keep them as safe as we can.My mum, a nurse, will have to be in work more now. She’s going to have loads of staff off with isolation, so she’ll probably be working a lot more.Last night I was quite worried, it was a bit of a panic.My work is on the same road I live on, so in my head I was just thinking, ‘I’m only going to be seeing one road for the next few weeks!’I’m thinking about people’s mental health as well, which might deteriorate because of this lockdown.Raegan Drew, , is a funeral director for the Co-op Funeralcare in Edinburgh.She says: “As funeral providers we have a social responsibility so, because of the stricter enforcement last night, we have decided to cut the number of mourners to ten, down from .Obviously the situation changes hourly and daily, so that number could change.We saw a huge drop in the amount of people attending from the middle of last week and this week more people seem to be making the decision for themselves and not attending.I conducted just one funeral yesterday and only a handful of people were there, because more people are self-isolating and taking advantage of the web services.Crematoriums are moving us to bigger chapels where they can to help people stay further apart, and we are encouraging social distancing.This is not the funeral many people would have wished or planned for so we are now offering families a memorial service at a later date to celebrate their loved ones.We have been issued guidelines for dealing with a coronavirus death and we have Personal Protection Equipmentto deal with that, although I haven’t personally used it yet.We are calling our families on a daily basis to update them, and everyone has been very understanding.The message has hit home – safety first.”Katie*, , is a social worker, supporting vulnerable young adults between -, many of whom have left the care or prison system, and often have severe mental health issues.She says: “This morning has been filled with dealing with the aftermath of the lockdown announcement yesterday, and there’s a lot more anxiety among the vulnerable young people, and staff too.Our managers need to know where we’re staying, and how long it will take us to get into work in an emergency.We’ve been told we now need to carry ID paperworkwe have to travel.I’m so upset and angry at people getting public transport unnecessarily —I have to travel for work the least people could do is stay home to limit the risk of passing the infection on to key workers.We’re worried because our most vulnerable won’t be able to see us, so we have to give them details on support lines and online information instead.There’s a phrase — ‘flight, fight or freeze’ and unfortunately so far my young people are frozen.They don’t know what to do. I’ve had a phone call from a lad who called up Universal Credit to seehe could get an advance payment but because he’d already had one recently he can’t.He only has £ left on his electric and only has frozen food, so I now need to sort out food parcels and ensure he’s OK.My biggest worry is how the young people I look after with mental health issues will cope with isolation — Ive been calling them everyday and doing what I can.In happy news, following our plea on Facebook for a car seat for the baby due imminently, we got one yesterday, and so many people have also generously made donations sowe have any further emergencies and need to buy any products were covered — it’s uplting to know there are people who want to help.”Kirsty Gage, , is a childminder from Kettering, Northamptonshire. She lives with partner Lewis and their son, Tommy, one.“Usually I take the children to play groups, the library and the park, but under the lockdown we can’t do that so I think cabin fever will be high over the next few weeks.Thankfully I have a garden which is kitted out for the kids but I have some from am to pm and that’s a long time to keep them amused.I’m also limiting the toys because I have to deep clean them every night.Today they have a tray of blocks, a kitchen set, a wooden puzzle, the toys in the garden, and they’ll do painting or drawing.Tonight I’ll put everything in a bath full of Milton sterilising fluid for a deep clean, the blocks will go in the dishwasher and ball pit balls in the washing machine.They bring their own packed lunches so I don’t have to worry about food supplies.Kids are a nightmare with toilet roll – they never use it sparingly – so I’m going to have to be on them, but I have plenty at the moment!My biggest worry is the coronavirus coming into the house.One of my key worker children goes to school and when I picked him up yesterday, he said there were just  kids there.I could see them in the playground and they weren’t being kept apart, they were playing as normal.Today they are joining with the infant school and that will be more kids together, which worries me.I can’t afford not to have him, and his mum needs me to have him, but I am deeply concerned he could bring the coronavirus into the house.”*Names have been changed to protect their identities. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was shocking.“There were people waiting with trolleys as far as the eye could see. I counted at least , but there was more. It was madness.”The shocked woman added: “I only went there for bread and milk and people behaved asthere was a war.“When we got it was so busy and impossible to do a shop because there were so many people. Even first thing in the morning there was no toilet roll left.“I stood there for an hour to pay for my shopping because so many people were there. It was busier than at Christmas time.”It comes after Mr Johnson last night put the UK under virtual house arrest for at least three weeks — warning the nation: “You must stay at home.”And today, Boris will send a text message to every Brit to tell them to stay at home during the lockdown.The messages were sent out this morning and each text contained a link to a document outlining the Government’s latest advice.It read: #CORONAVIRUS ALERT.

If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.Boris also announced that gatherings of more than two people would be banned.But it was not clear about whether meeting one friend - such as a partner who lives in another house - would be allowed.The only exceptions that have been revealed so far are for key workers taking their kids to school, or for separated couples taking children to see the other parent.Earlier today No were unable to confirm whether Brits would be able to still see their lovers.It is unclear whether partners would be able to see each otherthey stayed two metres apart, as is the guidance for everyone at the moment unless you share a home.No were today asked specically whether last nights lockdown would mean that boyfriends and girlfriends should not see each other.Downing Street stressed that the rules were clear and that people should only be going out of the house alone, with members of their own live-in family - orit were for work reasons.The PMs spokesperson said this morning: I think the rules are clear in relation to when you are out of the house, only do so with members of your own household orits for work reasons.People should follow rules in a common sense way.I think people should look at guidelines and use their common sense.We are working at pace and as people raise issues we will get clarity for them.Last nights draconian measures which will change every aspect of Brits’ lives included:The police are being given emergency new powers to enforce the draconian bans, initially with on the spot fines of £.Cops will begin issuing them to non-compliers as soon as new laws can be rushed through the Commons, probably by Thursday night. "},{"url":null,"title":"new coronavirus tests arrive days home frontline","story":"NEW coronavirus tests will arrive in the UK in days - as the first testing lab is set to open today, the Government has said.Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that . million antibody tests had been bought - which will showyou have had Covid-.Speaking at Downing Street tonight, he said: Weve now bought . million antibody tests that will allow people to see whether they have had the virus and are immune to it and then can get back to work.We expect people not to be able to catch it, except in very exceptional circumstances, for a second time.He added that a new testing facility in Milton Keynes had opened today to process the checks ahead of them being ramped up.Meanwhile, Mr Hancock called on some , volunteers in good health to help the national effort in tackling coronavirus, help the NHS and support the vulnerable.More than , extra NHS staff have already joined up to help fight against the virus, including retired doctors and nurses ing to the service and final year students, he added.Mr Hancock also confirmed that a temporary hospital - the NHS Nightingale hospital - would be opening at Londons ExCeL centre.It comes as the death toll in the UK hit  after  more cases in the biggest one-day rise so far - with , infected.Director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, who was also at the press briefing, revealed that the government was looking at anti-malaria drugs as a form of treatment.It came after Donald Trump announced last week that the drugs had become the first approved in the US to treat coronavirus.Prof Powis said: “There is a lot of interest both internationally and in the UK to learn how those drugs might be used.“Here in the UK, we want to do as much as we possibly can within the context of clinical trials.“We have excellent networks already set up to do clinical trials and it’s important that we do that to learn ways they work and where they don’t.“We’ve already recruited the first person in the UK into one of those clinical trials.”People signing up via the app will need to upload identity documents, driving licence , confirmation they have insurance, and  other role-related information.To sign up to become an NHS Volunteer Responder and join the trusted army helping others, visit the app here -

and pushed for a clearer date.The former health and social care secretary said: The concern is that we appear to be testing on a daily basis virtually no more people than over a week ago when the commitment was to increase the daily amount of tests from , to , tests.And given that this is a vital part of the success of the suppression strategies in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, can he give us an estimated date when we will get back to routine Covid- testing in the community of all suspected cases Because eventhats three, four weeks away, a date means theres a plan and without a date, people wont be confident that this really is the plan.Mr Hancock responded: Im not going to give him [Mr Hunt] such a date today because we are in the middle of buying the tests that are needed and especially the new tests that have just come on stream.I have been able to give him the update that we have now purchased millions of these tests which are arriving in the next days and weeks and Ill be in a position to give him a more concrete timetable and make sure he gets that as soon as we can make it public.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The Government has been working to ramp up the number of tests that can be carried out, amid widespread concern that the UK has no clear idea of how many people have coronavirus.NHS workers are also calling for tests, with some forced into isolation under current rules when a negative test would enable them to go back to work.Currently, coronavirus tests are only being given to those in hospitals or frontline staff - everyone  is asked to self-isolate at homethey experience minor symptoms.The tests also are only able to detect whether someone has the virus and not whether they have already recovered.But the government is said to have an antibody test ready and hope to make it available soon.It comes as a leaked Number  email sent to research institutes suggests the Government asking as late as Sunday to borrow equipment to ramp up testing.Reported by the Politico website, the email includes a plea from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to borrow or buy equipment for testing, saying there are no machines left to buy.But today, the Government denied that it had waited until Sunday to ask private sector firms and other institutions for support in boosting testing capacity, insisting that efforts had been going on for weeks.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: Its no secret that we are rapidly scaling up our efforts to boost testing capacity to protect the vulnerable, to support our NHS and to save lives.Together with Public Health England and the NHS we are exploring how we can work across industry and academic sectors to establish viable options which will signicantly ramp up the number of tests we can carry out.Earlier, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said testing NHS staff for Covid- is now one of the biggest issues that needs resolution according to hospital leaders.Mr Hopson tweeted: Its striking how many trust CEOs are telling us today that staff testing is vital and they feel that its now one of the biggest issues that needs resolutionthey are to properly support staff in the way they want to, and they believe is appropriate.Trusts are losing a lot of staff due to numbers in vulnerable groupsand those with household cases having to self-isolate.This is having a signicant impact on trusts ability to provide the right quality of care at the front line.Trusts are doing all they can to work round this - eg putting up staff who havent actually been in contact with Covid family members in hotels and reassigning vulnerable groups to other work.But maximising the numbers of staff on the frontline is vital.Mr Hopson said the NHS would reach , tests a day this week but called for clarity from national NHS leaders about what priority should be given to patient or staff testing and the reasons why.Last night, the Prime Minister ordered people only to leave their homes under a list of very limited purposes, banned public gatherings of more than two people and ordered the closure of non-essential shops.In an address to the nation from Downing Street on Monday evening, Mr Johnson ordered people to only leave their homes to shop for basic necessities as infrequently as possible, and to only perform one form of exercise a day.They can also seek medical help, provide care to a vulnerable person or travel to workabsolutely necessary, under the measures to last until at least Easter Monday.A failure to follow the rules could see police dispersing gatherings and imposing fines, which Government officials said would start at £.After the UK death toll hit , the PM ordered the immediate closure of non-essential stores including those selling electronics and clothing.The Prime Minister also ordered a ban on all public gatherings of more than two people - other than those they live with.Other premises to join pubs and restaurants in being closed are libraries, playgrounds, outdoor gyms, places of worship and hotels.Parks will remain open for exercise, but all social events including weddings and baptisms will be stopped. Funerals can continue.Mr Johnson said the measures will be under constant review and will be considered for relaxation in three weeksthe evidence allows.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That figure includes  per cent of Conservative voters and  per cent of Labour voters.What’s more, only two per cent of the public said they don’t intend to follow the new rules.His personal favourability rating has skyrocketed too.So how has the Prime Minister achieved the type of public support that most leaders during any era of our history could only dream of Because he made it clear he was desperate not to impose these measures.We support Boris introducing draconian rule over our lives now because it’s obvious that doing so is his worst nightmare.He started slowly, initially allowing schools to stay open and football games to still be played based on scientic advice.But as the modelling changed and the threat to le became very real, our willingness to comply dramatically increased too.Only time will tellhe did too much too soon or too little too late. However, I am prepared to say on the record that the measured response was the right one.The British public, who have been brave enough to put their lives and ideology to one side, will be horried to learn that leaders within the Labour party have tried to snf out a political opportunity here.Labour party chairman Ian Lavery has been caught by the Guido Fawkes website plotting to use the coronavirus crisis as what he disgustingly calls a “great opportunity”.He said: “By the way when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence. But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour Party members, community champions out there a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it gets people together. We need to make sure that we do that, and community organising what a great opportunity it’s going to give us.”How revolting.The coronavirus pandemic is not a great political opportunity, Mr Lavery.It’s an international tragedy of epic proportions that will cause grief for many and economic catastrophe for years to come.It’s caused someone I know to lose a dear relative before their time. It’s caused weddings to be cancelled, jobs to be lost and le savings to go down the drain.It’s not a “great opportunity” for anyone – and Lavery should immediately apologise for such a smear.

In Sweden you can not test yourself for Covid- unless you’re in need of emergent medical treatment.Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for COVID-, but it’s extremely likely that I’ve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances.For now she said she had recovered but wanted to warn the younger generation against ignoring warnings about the virus.She said: Manymight not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don’t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups.We who don’t belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the dference between le and death for many others.Please keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and stay at home to slow the spread of the virus.And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need.Greta also said the swt and far-ranging economic and social shts being brought in to stem the coronavirus pandemic showed rapid action needed to curb climate change was possible.Officials around the world have responded to the growing coronavirus outbreak by shutting businesses, closing schools and other facilities, banning gatherings and travel.Large-scale financial bailouts have also been proposed to keep slowing economies afloat.The coronavirus is a terrible event ... there is no positive to come out of it, the Swedish teenager told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an online interview.But it also shows one thing: That once we are in a crisis, we can act to do something quickly, act fast, said Thunberg, , whose solo school strikes for climate action helped spark a global youth climate strike movement.Though it must be in a dferent way to how we have acted in this case, we can act fast and change our habits and treat a crisis like a crisis.The youth climate strike movement that Thunberg inspired drew millions onto the streets around the world in .This year, however, faced with the emerging pandemic, young Fridays for Future climate activists have taken their weekly actions digital, using the Twitter hashtag #ClimateStrikeOnline.Thunberg urged young climate activists, many now stuck at home as schools close, to help others through the COVID- epidemic and to keep up their activism in safe ways.First of all, right now, we need to help in any way we can and back up society and people in need, she said.In figuring out how to deal with climate change, what we are telling everyone to do is to listen to the experts and listen to the science, and thats what we need to do in this case as well, she said.The virus crisis doesnt mean we need to let go completely of activism, she added.

There is another type from people who were infected in Italy.And there is a third type of virus found in people infected in England.Seven people had attended a football match in England.Tap to see where Covid- is near youThe study has not yet been published, meaning it hasnt yet been analysed by other scientists.Dr Derek Gatherer, an infectious disease specialist at Lancaster University, revealed he was not surprised with the findings.He told the MailOnline: This is much as we would expect. All viruses accumulate mutations, but few of them are of much medical consequence.They are valuable in tracing the origins of infection chains.It looks like Iceland has imported quite a few infections from other European countries.Allan Randrup Thomsen, a virologist from the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the University of Copenhagen, said the results described by the team make good sense.Professor Thomsen said: Coronavirus is known as a virus that can mutate reasonably violently.We have seen reports of iants from China already. That way, it fits well with what one expects.Earlier this month, researchers in China said they had found two main types of coronavirus could be causing infections.The preliminary study found that when the virus first crossed into humans, the ancestral strain - which they named S - subsequently evolved into another version, called L.In their study, they found that the older strain is the more aggressive and faster-spreading of the two.Initially the newer strain, L, was more prevalent - but is now reducing and S has gone onto become more common.The authors suggest that this could be because the disease it causes is less severe, meaning people can carry it for longer before they are hospitalised - making it the risk of passing it on greater.They also claim that the more aggressive version associated with the disease outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about  per cent of analysed strains.But experts warn that the study is very early data and more research is needed.Similar to the flu, Covid- may be more able to spread and infect more people as it becomes well adapted.However, the iants that cause people to get really sick may die out.Dr Gatherer said this process may take a couple of years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More serious cases develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock.The good news regarding COVID- is that % of people recover from the disease-with only % experiencing critical illness.As the number of people infected by coronavirus rises everyday, we can all play our part in reducing the spread of the virus by following the guidelines set by the government-which include staying at home, social distancing and regularly washing your hands with soap. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Concerned workers have complained that they are being told to still come into work despite government advice being to work from home where posssible. Some trains on Londonaposs Tube network were crowded again on Tuesday morning despite Boris Johnson placing the UK on a police-enforced lockdown with drastic new measures in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. The Prime Minister ordered people only to leave their homes under a list of very limited purposes, banned public gatherings of more than two people and ordered the closure of non-essential shops. But police chiefs warned of phone lines being inundated with calls on Monday night with questions about what movements are still permitted, while MPs also called for answers. And the construction industry has been singled out - with people ided onmuch of the work which is happening at the moment is truly essential. In Downing Staposs daily briefing Matt Hancock said: Of courseyou’re in a workplace we’ve said will close we’re going to enforce against those closures as well. But he did not say whether workers whose workplaces are not shut down can refuse to come in,theyaposre not personally ill. And he defended the governmentaposs policy. Matt Hancock said: “The judgement we have made is in work, in many many instances, the  metre rule can be applied. In my workplace in the House of Commons you can see it every day “Where possible people should work from home”. But he added “employers have a duty to ensure people are more than  metres apart.” Mr Hancock appeared to try and sht the blame for images on full tubes to Transport for London - who have cut tube numbers in the last few day. He said there should be more London Underground trains running.  He said: When it comes to the tube, the first and the best answer is that Transport for London should have the tube running in full so that people travelling on the tube are spaced out and can be further apart - obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible. And there is no good reason in the information that Iaposve seen that the current levels of tube provision should be as low as they are. We should have more tube trains running. But a spokesman for the mayor of London hit back. They said: This is simply not true. The mayor has told ministers countless times over recent days that TfL simply cannot safely run a full service because of the levels of staff sickness and self-isolation. Nearly a third of staff are already absent - there aren’t enough drivers and control staff to do it. The government must act urgently to get more people staying at home rather than going to work unnecessarily - that means taking the dficult decisions they are refusing to take to ban non-essential construction work and provide proper financial support to freelancers, the self employed and those on zero hours contracts to stay at home. The government says people should not go into work in person unless it is absolutely necessary. But unless a firm has been forcibly shut down, the definition of “necessary” is being left up to employers to work out. In these firms, bosses are free to continue asking you to come to work. However, new rules were due to be issued on Tuesday to cover firms whose workers are still going in despite the lockdown.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the rules would include a requirement on employers to keep workers  metres from each other. There will be unlimited fines for non compliance though they start at £, he said. Construction firms should also use “common sense” to ensure that distance is maintained, the government said. For instance large-scale construction sites have been told to go ahead - but domestic home extensions should be put on hold.

People are only allowed to leave the house for four reasons - shopping for basic necessities, one form of exercise a day, any medical or caring need, and travelling to and from work where this is absolutely necessary. Police will be given the powers to fine those who disobey. Yet itaposs that fourth reason - going to work - that has left millions of Brits mired in confusion this morning. Thataposs because the government has left it very unclear for whom, exactly, it is absolutely necessary to go to work. Unless youaposre a key workeror work for an industry thataposs been forcibly shut downthereaposs a huge grey area over whether you can stay away. That means bosses have still been asking workers to turn up across the country. And despite mounting fears over the spread of the virus, some of these bosses will be completely within their rights. The guidance is hazy in places, but as a public service we have pulled together the best guide we possibly can to who can, should, and shouldnapost go to work. The basic rules Everyone must stay at home wherever they can  No matter what your job, you must do it from at homeat all possible. You can only leave the house for four reasons:Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible One form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from homeIf you can work from home, work from home As a general rule, the government has said anyone who can work from home must work from home. You should only travel into work in personit is an absolutely necessary part of your job. If your business has been shut down, thereaposs a good chance you donapost need to go to work anyway  A whole litany of businesseshave been shut down - see the full list below. If your job is on this list, you probably wonapost need to go in, unless itaposs to provide takeaway services or help close up shop. Your firm can claim % of your wages back from the government, but that wonapost stop the possibility of you being laid off or having to take a pay cut. BUT millions of people do still need to go to work - and itaposs not just aposkey workersapos  There are millions of aposkey workersapos including NHS staff, police and firefighters who should continue going to work . See the full list below. However, there is a grey area for jobs that arenapost aposkey workersapos, but havenapost been forcibly shut down either. Unlike some countries, the government has not said that anyone who isnapost a key worker must stay away from work. If youaposre:Not a key worker But your firm hasnapost been shut down And you canapost work from home,... the government has not prevented your bosses being able to call you into work today. Instead, the guidance is that your firm can ask you to come to work - but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. The exact rules are being left to inidual firms.If you do go to work, you should apossocially distanceapos once you get there Anyone who is going into work is being told to keep  metres between them and other people where possible, and to cut down or completely eliminate face-to-face meetings. For retail workers this means:Ensure a distance of m between customers and shop assistants Let people enter the shop only in small groups Queue control is required outside of shops and other essential premises that remain openThere are still unresolved problems for the self-employedThe government was this morning racing to work out some kind of system for the self-employed. As of Tuesday at am they could not claim Statutory Sick Pay or a wage guarantee and must claim Universal Credit. Itaposs thought that will be changed very shortly to encourage self-employed people not to go to work. If you are self-employed and do go to work, the government advises you follow the advice on social distancing above. So for builders this means going to large new-build sites but not doing domestic jobs in peopleaposs homes.  No matter what,you have a cough or fever you must stay at home If you have a new, continuous cough or a fever your entire household must self-isolate at home for  days since the onset of symptoms. This means not leaving the house at all. Andyouaposre one of .million people contacted by the NHS you must stay at home .million people have been contacted by the NHS directlythey are particularly vulnerable to severe coronavirus. There people must stay at home for  weeks, regardless of whether they would normally be expected to work.

Michael Gove accepted there will be “specic circumstances” where the process is already under way, meaning people continue to buy or sell homes amid the pandemic. But he suggested a “pause”possible adding: “If at all possible, people should stay in their current home.”  Can I still play golf  No. “I don’t think people should be playing golf,” minister Michael Gove said. Clubhouses are likely to be shut anyway. He said people should define exercise specically as “one walk, one run or one cycle per day”.Can I still go to my allotment  Yes. Michael Gove said: “I think it’s perfectly sensible for people to go to an allotment. It’s in the very nature of allotments that there’s a safe distance between people who are working on an inidual allotment.” Is there a limit on how long my daily walk can be  No, but people are asked to use common sense. Cabinet minister Michael Gove said: “People can go for the standardof run or walk that they ordinarily would have done. The important thing is once per day.”  Are over s allowed out to shop  Yes, but try to avoid it. Over-s may go out to buy essentialsabsolutely necessary, but they are in an “at-risk” group. This means they should take even greater care to stay indoors than most people and,they can, ask a friendly neighbour or family member to drop food at the door instead. However, the government is not explicitly telling all over-s to stay indoors at all times no matter what. That instruction has gone only to those who are either in a household with symptoms, or one of the .million most at risk people . Can I still deliver food to relatives or volunteer for strangers  Yes. Cabinet minister Michael Gove said dropping food at vulnerable people’s doors “is an appropriate activity”. He added: “Making sure the vulnerable receive the support they need is absolutely critical.”  What happensI get ‘caught’ in a group of more than two  People gathering in groups of more than two can be handed a £ fixed penalty notice by police - which can rise and lead to a criminal convictionunpaid. The exception isyou’re in the same household. It’s still unclear how this will be policed exactly.  Am I allowed to go to banks and post offices  Boris Johnson said pretty clearly that people are to go shopping for essential foods, medical appointments or shopping or to help or care for the vulnerable. But what about banks  They remain open, but are you allowed to go Yes. People may go “infrequently” to these placesit is “essential”, for instance posting legal papers or essential financial work. A No spokesman told us: “The businesses that were left open were on the basis that they are providing essential services to the public. The reasons for that speak for themselves. We’ve set out that people should leave the housethey need to collect items infrequently.”  Can I get petrol and an MOT on my car  Yes - for petrol, see above but bear in mind you shouldnapost be making any non-essential travel at all including in the UK. For MOTs, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agencyhas said it is keeping the situation under review. But for the moment, cars, motorbikes, light vans will still need a valid MOT. Garages were specically excluded from those businesses that had to close, but you should check with your local mechanic about what their opening hours are. The DVSA has suspended testing of all heavy goods vehicles , trailers and public service vehiclesfor up to three months and said it is keeping testing of other vehicles under review. Can I drive to collect someone from the airport  There is no restriction on collecting people from the airport specically, but everyone has been asked to avoid all non-essential travel.  Picking up someone from the airport can fall into the category of essential travel - but it might be advisable to bring proof of their flight in case you are asked about your journey. I don’t live with my boyfriend or girlfriend - can I visit them   It seems not. Brits should not visit their boyfriendaposs or girlfriendaposs housethey donapost live together, Downing Street said. The governmentaposs rules explicitly say: You should be ensuring you are  metres apart from anyone outside of your household. Downing Street said: The guidance was clear yesterday. Essentially, what it said was that you should stay at home, and then it just set out four very specic circumstances where you may be permitted to go outdoors. And I think those rules should be applied to all scenarios. The exceptions are key workers taking kids to school, or split parents with shared custody iding time with kids. The Deputy Chief Medical Officer today confirmed boyfriends and girlfriends who live apart should stay apart. But she did offer a silver lining - saying lovers can move in with each other full-time and stay therethey want to take the plunge.  Why are warehouse and construction workers still having to go into work  Because the government has decided to let some people who aren’t “key workers” keep going into work. The government says people should not go into work in person unless it is absolutely necessary. But unless a firm has been forcibly shut down, the definition of “necessary” is being left up to employers to work out. In these firms, bosses are free to continue asking you to come to work. However, new rules were due to be issued on Tuesday to cover firms whose workers are still going in despite the lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the rules would include a requirement on employers to keep workers  metres from each other. There will be unlimited fines for non compliance though they start at £, he said. Construction firms should also use “common sense” to ensure that distance is maintained, the government said. For instance large-scale construction sites have been told to go ahead - but domestic home extensions should be put on hold.  I work for an office relocation company. We are being told that clearing a building of desks, pens, chairs etc is an essential job. I disagree. How do I find out where we stand as I feel our health is being ignored  It seems this is a grey area. As above, firms can still ask workers to come in - even non key workers -it is “absolutely necessary” for them to be there in person. We asked Downing Streetworkers can refuse to go in - and didn’t get a clear answer. Instead, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “I think our guidance in relation to anybody who fears they may have symptoms or anybody in their house might have symptoms is very clear. We need people to stay at home because ultimately that will save lives.” Asked again, he said: “Well, the list of sectors in which we don’t consider to be essential was spelled out very clearly in the guidance we published last night. That was a direct instruction from the government and we would expect employers to adhere to it.” But No did not say what happens for firms that haven’t been told to shut down. I am an administrator for the NHS. I have equipment and access to systems and can easily work from home, but my manager insists I go to work. Where do I stand  Can I refuse  See above - this is not black-and-white. We are told it would be a discussion between the inidual and the employer . Government guidance says you should work from homeyou can, soyou believe that is the case, keep pressing it with your manager. Escalate it to the HR departmentneeds be. There may be a good reason for you being there in person ask what it is. Can my separated partner and I still share custody of our kids  Yes. Children under  are still allowed to travel between both of their parents’ homes, minister Michael Gove claried - moments after he said the exact opposite. However, he said moving between households in this case should be kept to a minimum.  Why hasnapost everyone received a government text  I have not received one, yet my we has The UKaposs mobile networks are sending out a Government message to their customers with details of the new shutdown measures. It reads: “GOV.UK CORONAVIRUS ALERT. New rules in force now: you must stay at home. More info and exemptions at gov.uk coronavirus Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.” But not all customers have already received the message yet. That is because mobile operators are sending them out in batches - because the network can become overwhelmed. O told the BBC it was sending the texts in batches adding it could take until :GMT to complete the task. My  year old mother needs a prescription for insulin in the next few days, and canapost get through to GP surgery. What do we do  Government guidance is clear GPs should be able to process prescriptions over the phone and they should be staying open for this purpose - but they will be busier than usual. Check their website or social media pages for any details about when they are open or any dficulties they are experiencing. Keep trying - and in the meantime try contacting your MP for help in getting through to the surgery. In the meantime in an emergency pharmacists are permitted to supply insulin - but only in the  only the smallest pack size available. So consider calling themthe situation doesn’t improve. Why do renters have to accrue debt, while homeowners get a three month mortgage holiday  The short answer is because that is the way the government has structured its support. It’s a political decision but ministers have said they keep the situation under review. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick last week said: “The government is clear – no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.” In short it means that private tenants will not be evicted from their homes for at least three months. Households and families could see their Council Tax bills slashed by £ as councils look to support those who fall into aposvulnerableapos groups. Anyone who receives Council Tax Support will be eligible for help.  Will employers pay the extra cost of utilities for those working from home  There are no Government instructions to force your employer to help you pay the cost of working from home. Meaning any arrangement would have to be struck between you and your employer. That doesn’t mean  there is no help available. If you need to pay for stuff like office chairs, desks the taxman can help ease the burden slightly. You will need to fill out a P form, which you can do so long as you have spent your own money on expenses that have not been reimbursed andyour allowable employment expenses are less than £, for the tax year. HMRC guidance stipulates you can claim relief for items aposwholly, exclusively and necessarilyapos in the performance of your employment role. Important note - you can only make a P claimyou and your employer have agreed that you have to work from home.

The archbishops and bishops of the Church of England have written collectively to clergy, through their dioceses, urging them now to close all church buildings - other than where they are needed to keep a foodbank running, but even then under strict limits. There will be no church weddings until further notice funerals will not take place inside church buildings and the only baptisms will be emergency baptisms in a hospital or home. It follows the announcement by the Prime Minister last night of wide-ranging restrictions as part of a national and international effort to help limit the spread of the disease. “These are unprecedented times,” the bishops write. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email  webnews@mirror “We are all having to get used to being the Church dferently. “It is not easy. However, our belonging to Christ has never been measured by the number of people in church on a Sunday morningbut by the service we offer to others. “Therefore, and despite these very harrowing restrictions, please do all that you can to minister to your people safely, especially to the sick, the vulnerable and the poor.” The letter also seeks to provide clarity that churches will now be closed for all private prayer – including by priests.  Clergy live-streaming worship should do so from their own homes and are being urged to be as creative as possible with streaming services and other resources. “We must take a lead in showing our communities how we must behave in order to slow down the spread of the Coronavirus. “We must also do all that we can to provide resources and support for those who are isolated, fearful and vulnerable. “But we have to do this from our homes.” The Church of England will be offering a national weekly service which will be broadcast online each Sunday via social media and daily audio of prayer during the day and night prayer will also be available.  This is in addition to a wide range of resources local churches are sharing. An five million people heard or saw a service led by the Archbishop of Canterbury streamed online and broadcast through dozens of radio stations on Sunday – the largest single ‘congregation’ in the history of the Church of England. The bishops add: “It is also imperative that as the Church of Jesus Christ, called to offer hope and light in the darkness of this world’s ills, we maintain a praying presence for our community, though from today onwards this must happen from our hearts and from our homes.

Some have been giving their children the same break and lunch times offered in school - with packed lunches made up to eat at the dinner table.Kim Kenlay said on Twitter : Our own school timetable, created to keep the kids busy learning. Her plans for the week included cooking classes, outdoor play and PE. Another parent, Nasar Meer, a Professor at Edinburgh University, posted a robust timetable he had planned for the week. His lessons included Spanish, religious education and even yoga. He shared a picture of the timetable on Twitter, saying: Right then, P #homeschooling here we come.

Blue Cross has answered the many questions on pet owners minds. The charity say those social distancing can still take their dog for a walk and exercise once a day but they MUST keep their distance from other people by at least two metres. However,self isolating because they, or a member of their household, has had signs of the disease they should not go out at all. Someone from outside of the household may have to take their dog out for them. Owners can ask friends, neighbours or family membersthey can help and there are also increasingly numbers of community groups offering to walk dogs and pick up essential pet supplies. Affected owners can check local media and social media to find someone in their area.  Volunteer dog walkers should use their own dog lead or disinfect the owner’s lead. It is important pet owners wash their hands after handling their pets, andunwell and self isolating it is also a good idea to avoid other people stroking and handling their pets.

The poignant images captures the heartbreaking reality grieving families are having to face amid the Covid- outbreak. The five chairs were placed two metres apart ahead of a service at an unidentied crematorium on Monday.The heartbreaking scene captured how the stricter coronavirus distancing rules have been introduced for funerals as Britain goes into lockdown.It comes as venues across the nation introduce tougher rules for funerals, with some limiting the number of mourners to five or just immediate family. Boris Johnson announced funerals will still be allowed to go ahead, despite banning other social events such as weddings and christenings.Those grieving deaths have already been advised to avoid hugging, kissing or shaking hands when consoling loved ones as well as not handling orders of service. Now local authorities are stepping up measures to reduce capacity at crematoriums in light of the Prime Ministeraposs announcement on Monday night. One clergyman, who wished to remain anonymous, said: It breaks your heart to see scenes like this when conducting a service. Funerals should be a celebration of someoneaposs le, with friends and family surrounding each other for support and being able to hug each other. To see them reduced to such tiny numbers of people is a sad reminder of the crisis we are facing as a nation at the moment.  One funeral director in Worcester has revealed some funerals are going ahead without anybody in attendance to say their final farewells due to the coronavirus fears. Mark Campion, director of Jackson Family Funeral Directors, said many cremations were now being carried out without a funeral service beforehand to be safer. He also said a vicar held out a broomstick at a recent service to keep people apart and other upcoming funerals due to have hundreds in the congregation will now only be attended by three close family members. He added: Things have dramatically changed for us. I have not seen anything like this in  years. I just feel so sorry for the families because they canapost say goodbye to their loved ones like they usually would. Itaposs extremely sad for the families.Guidelines, published by the Funeral Celebrancy Council and issued by Humanists UK, advise families only have essential attendees who must obey social distancing rules. Isabel Russo, head of ceremonies at Humanists UK, said: Our main priority is ensuring that we support bereaved families to say farewell to their loved one in a personal and meaningful way, while still following the guidelines to keep people safe. We are also urging the Government to issue specic advice for the funeral industry to bring clarity across the sector. The Funeral Celebrant Councilaposs Independent celebrant rep, Emma Curtis said: Over the last week funeral celebrants around the country have felt a great deal of anxiety. The Funeral Celebrancy Council has responded swtly to issue clear guidelines to funeral celebrants as a coherent approach to help protect, not only the health and welfare of the bereaved people we serve, but also our fellow professionals, and wider society.  York Crematorium now only allows five mourners at a time and offers video streams of funeral services in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Elsewhere, The London Cremation Company, has followed suit and is only permitting  mourners at a time. Dudley Council has written to funeral directors saying only next of kin, siblings and partners, parents, children and partners, and a carerapplicable, will be allowed to attend cremations .

Richard Walker, the managing director of Iceland Foods, posted a photo online today showing a pair of branded vehicles completely destroyed by the blaze. The damage by yobs took place during wider destruction in the Henbury and Southmead areas of Bristol late last night. Police have since stepped up local patrols after branding the crimes, thought to be the actions of youths, as reckless and thoughtless. In a statement, Iceland said the disturbances began at around .pm. Do you have a coronovirus story  Email  webnews@mirror Police riot vans were called out and youths threw missiles at the police as they tried to disperse them, the retailer said. Later in the evening the two home delivery vans parked outside our Southmead store were set alight and the fire brigade attended to put out the fire. The vans will both have to be written off. We believe this to be an act of mindless vandalism rather than a targeted attack on Iceland. It added: While we can and will bring in replacement vans to maintain our home delivery service in Southmead, our entire van fleet is running at absolutely full capacity at the moment, and it is shocking and distressing that anyone would act so callously to put vehicles out of service at precisely the time when they are most needed to deliver food to the most vulnerable people in our society. The shocking acts came just hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that people should only venture outside for essential reasons to beat coronavirus. Posting on Twitter, Mr Walker said:  of our vans in Southmead were burnt out last night during disturbances in the town.At a time when home delivery is literally a leline for some vulnerable people, this is sickening. As well as the torched vans, police also received reports of bricks being thrown through windows and cars being smashed up between pm and :am. Neighbourhood Chief Inspector Mark Runacres, of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, issued a stern warning to others thinking of carrying out the same acts again. He said: Just hours after the Prime Minister announced that everyone in the country should stay home to save lives it is beyond belief that anyone would be so reckless and thoughtless.

Dad-of-six Paul Williams was beaten to the ground by Connor Jones, who walked away but ed to the stricken man minutes later and, while others were trying to help the casualty, cruelly kicked him in the head.Ten months after the attack, Paul is still suffering with memory and language problems and has lost his senses of taste and smell, reports Wales Online. The man who changed his le has been jailed for six years. Swansea Crown Court heard it was not known what caused the attack though the two men were known to each other having both been carrying out community service work the week before. Robin Rouch, prosecuting, said in the early hours of April  last year Mr Williams was out socialising in Llanelli town centre. Just before .am he became involved in an “altercation” with other men near Bar Luna. Jones then approached the group and attacked the victim, punching him a number of times and knocking him to the floor. The court heard Mr Williams remained on the ground for a minute before getting to his feet at which point Jones punched him down again. Mr Williams managed to get to a nearby wall and sat down but Jones followed him. The prosecutor said a “tussle” then ensued and Jones was seen to carry out “two stamping motions” – though the court heard the defendant denies he stamped on his victim. Jones left the scene but ed a couple of minutes later. By now his victim was lying helpless on the floor being tended by passers-by but the defendant walked up to him and kicked him a number of times to the head. The court heard Mr Williams has no memory of the prolonged attack. The last thing he can remember is leaving the town’s Met bar at around .am and heading towards the Asda supermarket. His next recollection is waking up in bushes near a chapel in the town centre.He managed to stumble home and at around am his we was woken by a “loud bang” at the door. She went downstairs and found her husband being sick and with blood over his face. An ambulance was called and he was rushed to hospital. A subsequent CT scan showed fractures to the cheek, nose, and eye socket bones, and to the skull, as well as multiple contusions to the brain. He had to spend two days in the emergency department. Jones, of Clos Dewi Medi, Morfa, Llanelli, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. The court heard he has a number of previous convictions, though none for offences of violence, and was on a community order at the time of the attack for possession of cannabis and stealing lead from a roof. Dean Pulling, for Jones, said the defendant was remorseful for what he had done and accepted a prison sentence was inevitable.  The barrister said: “This incident is an advert for the pernicious effects of too much alcohol and drugs on young men out late at night.” He added that his client had spent three weeks on remand prior to sentencing which had been his first taste of custody – “an experience he has not found pleasant”. Judge Keith Thomas told Jones he had involved himself in a dispute between other people before punching his victim then “coming for him again” with his feet. Giving the defendant a discount for his guilty plea he sentenced him to six years in prison. Jones will serve half that period in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community. He was also made the subject of a restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Williams for the next seven years."},{"url":null,"title":"girl 4 cant consoled after","story":"NewsGirl, , cant be consoled after learning her favourite takeaways have shutA mum has gone viral on social media after sharing her daughters very relatable reaction to discovering that the coronavirus pandemic had caused all her favourite takeaways to shutShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video child-cant-consoled-after-discovering-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news girl--cant-consoled-after-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The stay-at-home mum decided to film the interaction as she knew her daughter was going to be a drama queen about it - despite admitting that they donapost even eat that many takeaways.She thought the clip was so funny, she later decided to share it on Facebook, where it went viral, garnering over one million views. Joanne said: We were sitting down talking and she has been a bit bored obviously as we have been in isolation. I had been saying all day that we were going to have one last McDonaldaposs and I thought I haven’t really been telling her why I kept saying that. I am very honest with her about what is happening in the world at the moment and I thought I’d explain to her the reasons why as it felt like a good time.She knows Boris Johnson by now and she says to me ‘mummy does Boris Johnson say we can go to the park today’ and I tell her I’m going to have to speak to him to see what he says. She continued: So when I was explaining to her about the takeaways and everything closing I said that Boris is saying they have to close as everybody’s got a lot of germs.I said ‘Layla you do realise that Mcdonaldaposs is closing and is going to be closed for a long time’ and then she started crying a bit and I thought I would pick up my phone to see where this goes. Then she kept on crying as she does like McDonaldaposs - but doesn’t eat it all the time. Afterwards she just cuddled me and then went upstairs to bed and called her nana.

I even recorded a video to my we and child to say goodbye because at one point I nearly gave up due to the pain and the fear. Matt, who works in the live venues industry, was unwell for days at home before his we rang . Medics then became increasingly concerned for his health. Matt, who now lives in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, added: “It has taken quite a while to write this post and I wanted to do so for one main reason. “I’m currently in an intensive care unit and at one point was given a small window of survival, as my lungs are failing, and I now am waiting to be sedated and put on a ventilator.  “I have been ill for three weeks, from a small cough on the day I watched football at Wembley on  March, to chills, fever and headache as we opened our new venue in London. “Day by day, I felt hungover and crap, but I carried on like a true hero, ignoring every bit of family advice. “The doctors askedI had been to China and that was enough to disregard Covid- and for them to tell me that I may have a seasonal virus, but they gave me some antibiotics just in case. “I didn’t leave the couch for the next five days, and I was struggling to stay awake and breathe properly. “It took two hours and still no answer from , and each day it got worse. “Finally, my we couldn’t listen to me anymore and called an ambulance. “Within an hour, I was blue-lighted into a military operation, where doctors in hazmat suits told me that they thought I had Covid- – and that I was critically ill. “They were going to call my we and family and explain that I would have to be put to sleep, and then put on a ventilator, as my lungs were failing and would be going into respiratory arrest.

The -year-old has left the -square metre flat only to go for a jog alone or buy groceries - and carries a certicate with him to state his reason for being outside should he be stopped by police. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email  webnews@mirror  Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in a televised address to the nation on Monday night sweeping measures for the UK, including people remaining indoors except for exercise once a day and shopping trips for necessities only.Mr Brady, a policy analyst on secondment in the French capital until June, told the PA news agency: The key thing is donapost look at the endgame, donapost look at the lockdown in its totality. I made that mistake last Monday and had a bit of a wobble, knowing that Iaposm basically not going to see or interact with another human for another couple of months.  The most important thing Iaposve found just for psychological well-being and mental health is - and I know it sounds like a trite cliche but - one day at a time. He spends  minutes before bed each night planning the next day which includes dedicating an hour to an online exercise class, and has made a list of films he has always wanted to watch.  Everybody is going to suffer from a wobble, he said. Everybody will have moments where they just look at it from a macro rather than a micro perspective and thataposs so daunting, so intimidating. But allow yourself that wobble and then get back on the horse again.  Mr Brady said he had seriously considered ing home to Northern Ireland when French President Emmanuel Macron gave notice of the lockdown last week, but felt it would have been irresponsible to do so. He said: I had a window of opportunity to travel and I just thought I couldnapost in good conscience be that irresponsible because I might be carrying the virus. I might be asymptomatic. How irresponsible would it be of me to come from an area of high incidence and take it back home  I just thought this is a level of social responsibility I need to take, not for me but for other people. Despite his positive mindset he admitted it is an extra challenge to be away from family and unable to help his self-isolating parents who fall into the category of people urged to stay at home for at least the next  weeks.  He said: Donapost get me wrong, itaposs really hard. The frustration is that Iaposm not there to support my family as much as I could bebut weaposre all pulling together as much as we can. The family WhatsApp has never been busier. Like many others in affected countries across the world Mr Bradyaposs family is also making use of group video calls to keep in regular contact, and he has tried to keep up his social le in the same way using online apps.

While he is expected to make a full recovery, Jessie issued a warning about the dangers of babies and toddlers being apossecret carriersapos. The -year-old said she first noticed his symptoms on Sunday but didnapost initially think anything was seriously wrong as Perran had been badly teething. The Devon and Cornwall Police admin worker said: It was Motheraposs day and he woke up in a bit of funk with a temperature but we thought he was badly teething. aposaposWe got up early to get some fresh air and thought the cold could help with his temperature but did not think much more of it. We took him for a walk but from lunchtime onwards he started to go downhill quickly. He went really lethargic and really cuddly, which was not like him. He then had a horrendous temperature. He had no breathing dficulties or a cough but was on fire with his temperature.  Jess, from Looe, Cornwall, said the whole family including her husband Joe, , and daughter Felicity, four, are now in  days isolation. She added: We tested his temperature and it was over  degrees. Then we got really worried and we did not know what to do. aposaposThere is a lot of advice out there but it is not clear for children and babies. He is only one. We phoned  and after speaking to five dferent people we got through to a doctor who was really reassuring.  People think babies wonapost get it and it is vital we put the message out they do. aposaposThey will get it but just might not get the severe repercussions. They can still be carriers though and that is what makes it dangerous. Jessie said that while Perran would be okay, the disease had still knocked him for six. She continued: aposaposPeople think children are immune but they are still getting it. He should bounce back but it has still been a bit of a shock for us all. My mum is in the same house and we have to self isolate away from her as she is  and has health concerns.  Perran is still not himself. He is really hot and is jerking awake. He is not really eating, but should be ok. aposaposBut as a mother it has been a horrible thing to go through. He has been really poorly. People are still not understanding the severity of what we are in and you still see some being selfish.

Lauren described it as the worst experience of her le when Alfie first started to show symptoms on Monday March .  Her post continued: His blood sugar levels were only ., his respiratory rate was - and his heart rate was , the sweat was pouring out of him but he was shivering, he was panting for breath and he had photophobia.

The health effects of the Covid- outbreak have generally been milder on children but many unknowns remain.  The mother detailed how Alfie deteriorated after he attended a swimming lesson last week. She said: He started off sounding husky last Monday and I put it down to swallowing too much chlorine from his swimming lesson that day, then he got a bark-like cough and it worsened throughout Tuesday, then his temperature suddenly kicked in Tuesday night and it shot straight to . so I had to keep him off school.  Alfie kept saying he was ok and felt good - which he normally does. But come Thursday his temperature had hit . and I couldn’t get it down.

Describing the scary moment her little boy was rushed off in an ambulance on Thursday afternoon, Lauren continued: Later that evening he was vomiting, hallucinating, crying, holding his head saying it felt like it was going to explode and his eyes were hurting, so the ambulance came out and said we had to go back in. Upon arriving at Worcester hospital, Lauren said they were given masks to wear and were rushed to an isolation room where Alfie was swabbed and tested for Covid-. She described the hospital as a ghost town and said the medical staff were wearing protective gear and masks at all times.  As Lauren also suffered from a cough, she was allowed to stay by Alfie’s side after the paramedics and a nurse gave them a bed in the isolation unit following his positive coronavirus results. She said: They gave him medicine and they kept him stripped off and on fluids to bring his temperature down. I couldn’t fault the hospital staff. They reassured me, kept me informed and askedhe wanted anything. They even brought me tea and coffee!  After being kept overnight from Thursday until Friday evening, Lauren said the hospital allowed them tohome with strict isolation restrictions. She said: ‘‘The hospital advised that as long as I could give Alfie medicine - I would be able to self-isolate us all at home. He’s still recovering now after a week and a day.

It is now almost two months since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK. In the weeks since, most people have become aware that a newly formed dry, persistent cough and a fever are two of the tell-tale signs of Covid-. There are also milder, less obvious symptoms to look out for. Below are some of the signals that may suggest you have been infected. Have you fallen ill with Covid-  Email webnews@trinitymirror Loss of sense of smell and taste Over the weekend the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology warned that losing your sense of smell and taste may mean you have Covid-. The ear, nose and throat specialist recommended anyone with such symptoms self-isolate immediatley. It has been suggested that the phenomena may be caused by the coronavirus killing cells in the nose and throat. Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas, the Association said in a statement. We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus. Ryan Van Waterschoot ended up in hospital relying on an oxygen mask after he fell ill with Covid-. A day after losing his sense of taste and smell he was unable to move. Physical fatigue     Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult. Jaimuay Sae-ung, , was the first Thai national to contract coronavirus in December last year. Despite having underlying health conditions, including a heart problem, Jaimuay survived the illness after doctors isolated her at a hospital in Thailand for treatment. I only knewafter I came to the hospital, the mother of seven told Sky News. I felt a bit sad, a bit shocked, tired and fatigued and I couldnapost eat. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Mental fatigue Although this has not been officially chalked up as a symptom, Covid- sufferers have reported experiencing mental fatigue. Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache. The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman told the publication. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. Lack of appetite    To ying degrees those who have caught the coronavirus have complained of losing their appetite. While some may be just a little less intrigued by their food than usual, others, such as racing blogger Stephen Power, have no desire at all to eat. He believes he contracted the disease while at Cheltenham Festival. The North West London man said: Iaposve been in bed with a nasty fever, headache, mild cough  back pain for nearly four days now, Iaposm completely exhausted and have no urge to move or eat. Tummy ache    As with a loss of appetite, enduring a tummy ache may easily be passed off as a sign of something more innocuous. However, a newly published study by the American Journal of Gastroenterology links tummy problems to Covid-. They found that .% of  people who have been infected by the coronavirus in Chinaaposs Hubei province had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea.

And while you may feel like doing all that is a lot, itaposs worth sparing a thought for the medical staff and carers having to go to extremes to keep themselves and their patients safe. A nurse from Ohio has shared her daily aposdecontaminationapos routine, which starts the second she leaves work and gets in her car - and itaposs fair to say itaposs really intense.The nurse, known only as Jess, shared a video of a few of the steps she follows on TikTok, where it quickly went viral. The hospital worker, who has worked in her profession for eight years, is currently caring for patients impacted by the Covid- pandemic. As such she is taking all of the proper precautions, including soaking her shoes in bleach water and disinfecting her car when she gets home from the hospital. In her TikTok video, she says: Just got home after having a suspected COVID- patient on our unit. Commence the decontamination routine. The footage shows her taking off her shoes and putting them in a tub of bleach water, to soak overnight, before getting out disinfectant wipes to clean over her phone, watch and keys. Jess then strips out of her scrubs in the garage, putting them straight into the wash. But this is the least of it.Speaking to Yahoo Lestyle, the nurse added that once sheaposs put the clothes in the wash, she takes a shower, then does a daily home wipe down targeting all doorknobs, all light switches, remotes, toilet handles, fridge, microwave and sinks.The video, which was shared last week has since had millions of views.

While weaposre being urged not to panic buy and store bosses are saying there is enough to go around, people have still been clearing the shelves making it hard to pick up bits like milk, bread, pasta and eggs. This has left many people wonderingthey can freeze some of the things they have in the fridge already - especially as  weaposve been asked to go to the supermarket as little as possible. In short, yes, you can freeze milk - but, itaposs best used when cooking or making smoothies because the texture changes after freezing. It may go slushy, grainy, or have fat separation - but this can be fixed with a blender. You must make sure to freeze it in an air-tight and freezer-safe container because the milk expands. It can be stored for up to six months, but itaposs advised to defrost it within the first months of freezing - but this is just because it tastes better. And, it should be defrosted in the fridge to reduce the chance of bacterial growth. The existing bacteria count in the milk may increasethe milk defrosts at room temperature for a prolonged time.  Healthline says: This is because the longer milk sits at room temperature, the more likely it is that any existing traces of harmful bacteria prolerate, potentially causing the bacterial count to become high enough to cause illness from drinking the milk.You could also place the container in cold wateryou have less time - never hot or warm - but there is a slightly higher risk of bacterial growth. If youaposre planning to cook with frozen milk, defrost it directly in the pot as you are cooking.  Healthline explains that there are a number of dferent types of milk which may separate during freezing. Most milk may separate during freezing like almond milk, dairy milk, soy milk, oat milk, human breast milk - which may also smell and taste dferent - goat and flax milk. Coconut milk, evaporated milk, and sweetened condensed milk may also separate but must not be frozen in the cans.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email While most of us are binge-watching Netflix or drinking wine while looking at a frozen video call with our pals, one woman had a much bolder idea for her coronavirus self-isolation free time.University student Rebecca, , decided to use the time for self-growth after coming across a quote from Kitty O’Meara -  And the people stayed home. And read books, and listened and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. So she decided to contact her exes to find out why they broke things off with her. Rebecca said: The people who have experienced the worst of me are definitely the most qualied to tell me what went wrong and how to improve. It’s worth a try to see how I can be the best me I can be.  Plus, I really didn’t have anything better to do - I was just so bored. Waiting for them to reply was terrying, but actually everyone was really nice - there’s no hard feelings there. It gave me a bit of a reality check - it’s so easy to just block someone out of your le. The first call she made was with Jay, whom she met in her first-year accommodation. She broke up with him last year - whilst in bed with him - after dating for a few months. Jay said that when they first got together everything was great but then said: After thinking it through for a while, I guessed you probably thought that yes I’m nice and I look after you, but that you aren’t getting the most out of someone you should be fully committed to. I don’t believe you made any wrong conscious choices, and neither did I. The second phone call was to Tim - they were friends before they got into a relationship, and dated for a couple of months about three years ago.  Rebecca desperately tried to break up with him, claiming it was impossible to do so - and even said that she was confused about her sexuality - which Tim was so understanding as to offer to work things out together. But it turns out Tim still thought sheaposd ended things really out of the blue especially since sheaposd even brought him gts the day before. Eve though she blocked him, it didnapost stop Tim from apologising after she had ended things. He turned up at her house with a photo album which he had decorated himself with writing and flowers. He said: I do wanna say, and I feel this is a good time to say it, that I’m sorry for after it happened and I came to your house, still feel like a dick about it years later. And his one piece of advice: It’s the cutting people off really - like for the longest time I assumed you just got bored of me. The third and final call was to Ed - her first kiss.  And, since the pair are still friends he wasnapost afraid to be a little more heartless with his advice. He revealed the pair had only been together for three days and said Rebecca should have had the the b******s to dump me yourself after Rebecca had her scary friend do the deed for her. He soon got back to the task at hand, suggesting these improvements: One, confidence. Two, you could have been a bit more passionate, a bit more affectionate.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility. But the government does say people who are self-isolating can keep windows open to get fresh air.Whatrsquos social distancing The government is advising everyone who is not currently self-isolating to still practise social distancing.This means not meeting with friends and family, staying away from crowded areas, avoiding all non-essential travel, and working from home where possible.Luckily for these people, there is no restriction on going for walks outside. The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

The David Austin Handbook of Roses, gted by a green-fingered friend, is jam-packed with temptation. One of the delights of summer is to be taken around this friendrsquos delectable garden. A riot of sweet peas, foxgloves and hollyhocks, with soaring old trees casting welcome shade, its walls are swagged with clematis and honeysuckle.

Planted together, would they get on or would the results be another tragedy  I seem to remember Darcey Bussell was once askedshe would rather be given a damehood or have a rose named after her. She now has both.Vita Sackville-West was a self-confessed sucker for catalogues. The doyenne of Sissinghurst Castle, in Kent, which she turned into a horticultural paradise with her husband Harold Nicolson, she also wrote a very practical gardening column for The Observer. Early in the autumn of  she complained that catalogues were arriving by every post. ldquoIt is dficult to keep onersquos head. I always lose mine.... Experience tells me that I ought to resist, but, like the poor mutt who falls to the card-sharper in the train, I fall to every list offering plants I cannot afford to buy and could not cultivate successfully evenI could afford them.She was at work when nurseries were only reluctantly opening their doors to amateurs and garden centres were almost unheard of. Catalogues were the way to buy seeds, and seedlings, and set your plot up for the coming year. Many folk in Hoolet have their own greenhouses and potting sheds, but itrsquos as much as I can do to plant something bought in a pot and keep it alive long enough for it to learn to fend for itself. I speak encouragingly to each new arrival, hoping that snow and wind donrsquot kill it before the roots have taken, or some night-time critter digs it up for a taste of bonemeal in which itrsquos bedded.When it comes to roses, I was cheered by the poet James Fentonrsquos advice. He wrote a book about growing a garden from  packets of seed, but with one important caveat: ldquoI do not propose that you start your roses in this way: That would be, as Peter Pan says of death, an awfully big adventure.Seed catalogues are for experts and connoisseurs, a higher level of botanical sophistication and dedication than I ever expect to reach. The New Yorker writer Katharine S White was a devoted gardener at her Maine farmhouse where she lived with her husband, E B White. I have a collection of her gardening columns, Onward  Upward in the Garden, which are surprisingly and disappointingly dull. Occasionally, though, she surprises me.Among her prized catalogues were those by the Calornian rose expert, Will Tillotson. He had a very distinctive style. Indeed, as you find your feet in this new field of prose, you discover all these writers become as identiable as Ernest Hemingway or Muriel Spark. Thinking up new ways of conveying the essence of hundreds of roses must be challenging, and Tillotson once showed the strain: ldquoOh gentle reader, he wrote, ldquoforgive meyou are lsquosleepyrsquo or bored or annoyed. The tired catalogue writer has emptied his sack of adjectives at your feet. This phrase was used as the sign-off to his last catalogue, printed shortly after his death. It was a poignant envoi.The David Austin Handbook is also posthumous, carrying the news of ldquoMr Arsquos death at the end of . He was a Shropshire Lad, which might explain the profusion of literary names and references in his glorious collection and the clarity of the puffs for each plant. As with all plant catalogue writers, the descriptions are as glowing aseach specimen was one of the authorrsquos own brood.I donrsquot think of myself as particularly impetuous, but I anticipate a moment when, like Sackville-West, I too might lose my head. The rosette-like iety named after Anne Boleyn would be fitting, but Irsquom drawn to the simpler kind that remind me of dog-roses found in hedgerows: Open Arms, Rosa complicata, Morning Mist, Fru Dagmar Hastrup, or Rosa rugosa alba, the one known as The Jacobite, with its old-fashioned fragrance, innocent white flowers and wicked thorns."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Did Glasgow-set drama The Nest get off to a flying start ","story":"FORGET about the column inches Michelle Mone has racked up, or the seat in the House of Lords.

Therersquos always been enough to go round.These are truths that have long been scoffed at when those on the left tried to highlight them - most recently Jeremy Corbynrsquos Labour Party in last yearrsquos General Election which, unbelievably, took place just three months ago. Plans for wide-ranging nationalisation, the abolishment of tuition fees and free broadband for all were made a laughing stock of by opposition politicians and establishment media alike, whose taunting most often took some form of the question ldquohow are you going to pay for that Many will remember the BBCrsquos Emma Barnett mockingly asking Angela Raynerthe party wanted to nationalise sausages it wasnrsquot necessary for the Conservative Chancellor to specically mention meat-based products in last weekrsquos announcement when he essentially nationalised almost every industry in the country in one quick sweep.When former prime minister Theresa May infamously remarked that ldquothere isnrsquot a magic money tree we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want, it was in response to a nurse whose pay had been frozen for eight years and who was struggling to survive on her wage. If it seemed callous at the time, it seems unthinkable in the current moment. Not only does the magic money tree exist, underpaid nurses and their like should be first in line to shake it.Because while Mr Sunak deserves few platitudes for doing the only thing possible and conscionable under current circumstances, he will surely be credited with changing politics forever. Now wersquove seen that money can be borrowed to help those in need, how can we ever justy leaving people homeless on the streets  Now we know therersquos no limit on the cost of state intervention, why should anyone struggling ever have to pay for childcare  When itrsquos clear that political will is all that stands between poverty and the spending of trillions of pounds, how can we ever look at a foodbank again The genie is out of the bottle: the free market is not infallible or inevitable ending inequality is possible. Things can never be the same again.Of course, this is not the utopia that any on the left would wish for. Short-term crisis response is not an ideology, and nor is the maintained concentration of the levers of power with a small group of politicians socialism. But the scale of intervention pledged by Sunak cannot be overstated or removed from its context in history: in the UK, in our letimes and beyond, we have never seen the likes of it.Coronavirus has already put immense strain on the worldrsquos citizens and the global economy, with far worse expected to come. Praise for Mr Sunak has been widespread across the political and media class since his announcement, with many who have long sneered at ldquoCorbynomics lauding the Chancellor for his decisive leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-rules-hurdle-salmond-holyrood-comeback","story":"When he resigned from the SNP in August , the party rules stated that any member who quit had to wait for two years before they could reapply.That means Mr Salmond cannot apply until the autumn.However the SNP is choosing its candidates for the  election right now, and the selections will be over by the time he is eligible to rejoin.He would need a change of the party rules to overcome this, but the SNP conference and other decision-making bodies are suspended because of coronavirus.Mr Salmondrsquos apparent thirst for revenge against Nicola Sturgeon also means the SNPrsquos National Executive Committee, which she dominates, is unlikely to help him.This block helps explain one of Mr Salmondrsquos outriders, MP Joanna Cherry QC, yesterday saying he ldquomust be allowed to re-join the party without delay.But it is not that simple, andSNP HQ refuse to let him back him, it could lead to an almighty row within the party.If Mr Salmond was let back in, he would still have to get through vetting about what even his legal team admitted had been ldquoinappropriate conduct with women.Potential seats include Aberdeen Donside and Banffshire  Buchan Coast, where the incumbent MSPs are standing down.As a close ally of Salmond, the verdict may also boost Ms Cherryrsquos chance of being the SNPrsquos Holyrood candidate in Edinburgh Central.Mr Salmond is an expert on comebacks.He led the SNP from  to  until he resigned as an MSP.He then became leader again in  and an MSP again in .After resigning as FM in , he was elected MP for Gordon in , a seat he lost in ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11187054.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-research-reveals-mindfulness-key-golf-success","story":"And many believe a huge part of being able to truly get to grips with golf goes on between the ears.Now new Scottish research reveals how crucial psychology is in being able to boost performance, through the evidence of top players.Eight of Scotlandrsquos top male players have revealed the secrets of their success and what goes on in their minds before and after that big shot during professional competitions.In the first study of its kind in Scotland, lead researcher Alex Oliver, a sport and exercise PhD student at Glasgow Caledonian Universitys psychology department, looked at how golfers control their attention, which is vital for successful skill execution.Mr Olivers advice to sportspeople looking to boost performance would be: ldquoDonrsquot force it because thatrsquos when your performance can unravel.\"The research found that the establishment of a pre-shot and post-shot routine helped to offset distractions and is \"beneficial\" to concentration in competition.It also highlights the importance of \"mindfulness training\" to be able to deal with the disappointment of that duffed shot.One golfer explained: \"I drum it into the youngsters coming through because they are the ones that will tell their pals, oh am level after six holes, this is my best-ever after nine. Next think you screw it up on the back nine because youre score orientated. So I think your focus, your attention, has got to be on as much as you can, just on the task at hand, which is the next shot.\"Alex said his research ldquohelps us understand what concentration looks like in sport and what golfers need to do to concentrate.They all use mental tricks to concentrate and stop bad shots having a negative impact on their score. Tiger Woods has adopted a -step psychology routine - anytime he hits a bad shot, hersquos trained his mind to forget about it  steps down the fairway.Another golfer told the research: \" As soon as the ball leaves the club face you canrsquot do anything about it. You canrsquot control the bounce, you can estimate it but as soon as that ball hits the ground it could do anything. It could hit a stone, hit a worm cast, it could do absolutely anything. You canrsquot control it and you need to be more accepting.\"Another explained: \"The big thing is realizing yoursquore going to make mistakes. Wersquore always going to make mistakes.

At some point that information, that facts and that evidence will see the light of day.Sources have already told The Herald that Mr Salmond is set to instruct his trial lawyers, Levy  McRae, to take legal action against the Scottish Government over its handling of the complaints against him.Now the trial has finished, some of what he wanted led in court can be reported for the first time.At a preliminary hearing in January, the defence Mr Salmond hoped to use was laid out by his QC, Gordon Jackson, before trial judge Lady Dorrian.As Mr Salmond sat in the dock, Mr Jackson went through the lines of questioning he wanted to take with female complainers in the case, a standard legal step given the sensitivity involved in questioning them.Mr Jackson said it was a ldquovery unusual case from a ldquopolitical bubble.At its heart was the Scottish Governmentrsquos botched in-house investigation into two complaints of sexual misconduct against Mr Salmond when he was First Minister.After news of the investigation leaked in August , Mr Salmond launched a judicial review into how the Scottish Government ran this investigation.On  January , Mr Salmond won the review after ministers admitted it had been flawed from the outset.Because the investigating official had been in prior contact with the two complainers, the whole process was deemed to have been unfair, unlawful and ldquotainted by apparent bias.Mr Salmond claimed at the time there had been a conspiracy. ldquoSome people are very clearly very anxious to remove me now as a political threat, which is why this is probably not over, he said.Mr Salmondrsquos legal team intended to claim this humiliation for Ms Sturgeonrsquos government spurred a coordinated campaign to discredit him.:Nicola Sturgeon faces profound questions of integrity after Alex Salmond acquittalAt the preliminary hearing, Mr Jackson estimated the ldquoshambles had cost taxpayers up to pound million in legal fees.He said people working in the Government, deeply unhappy at the judicial review outcome, therefore ldquoturned their attention very directly to the criminal process.These people ldquowith a clear motivation sought to influence that process in order to discredit the former First Minister, Mr Jackson said.He said there was a ldquoconcerted effort made by people within the Government to advance the criminal process ldquoas best they could.He said people who did not want to be part of a criminal inquiry, or did not think any crime had been committed against them, or want to complain, were ldquoencouraged to complain.He said the ldquoprime mover was one of the complainers in the indictment.At a further hearing in Glasgow in February, Mr Jackson also quoted a text message from one complainer to an SNP employee: ldquoJeez, think [a complainer] is in trouble. [Salmond] isnrsquot going to stop until he gets her and hersquos bringing down Nicola on the way.After considering Mr Jacksonrsquos proposed questioning, Lady Dorrian disallowed much of it and the judicial review barely featured in the trial.His legal team constrained, Mr Salmond pushed the conspiracy theory when giving his own evidence, saying some allegations were ldquodeliberate fabrications for a political purpose, while others were ldquoexaggerations.Besides Mr Salmondrsquos desire for revenge, Ms Sturgeon also faces two crucial inquiries into her conduct related to the judicial review.After the Governmentrsquos case collapsed in , Ms Sturgeon insisted that she had, rightly, not known about the in-house probe taking place.She said Mr Salmond had informed her about it himself when he visited her Glasgow home in April .She told MSPs the meeting had been a purely ldquoparty matter, not a government one, and so there was no need to have officials present or to report it to her private office ndash a potential breach of the ministerial code which will now be investigated.However, at the trial, Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff, who brokered the meeting, said he met Ms Sturgeon in her Holyrood office a few days earlier, something she has never revealed.A Holyrood committee inquiry set up after the review will want to knowMs Sturgeon misled Parliament.Ms Sturgeonrsquos husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, is also facing calls from Mr Salmondrsquos outriders for an inquiry into how the party handled complaints against the former leader.

Indeed, the necessity for them is that unlike citizens, who are considered free to do anything not expressly prohibited by law, governments cannot assume powers without legislation that explicitly grants them.Naturally, there are people mdash the ones under the delusion that the current Government is ldquothe most right-wing ever mdash who see this as a fascist coup along the lines of Kristallnacht. These are often the same people that have been complaining the Government hasnrsquot done enough to tackle the virus, even while declaring that the economic consequences of austerity have killed hundreds of thousands, and despite the fact that these opinions are mutually contradictory.OK wersquove grasped that they take a dim view of Boris Johnson. But even thosewho think the Government has, by and large, handled the crisis fairly well are right to cast a critical eye over these provisions.Almost all governments of every political stripe are reluctant to est themselves of powers once they have acquired them. In America, for example, the provisions of the Patriot Act, introduced hastily and with little oversight after the terrorist attacks of , are still in place, representing a restriction on civil liberties that would have been highly controversial  years ago.So a built-in two-year expiry date, and the undertaking to review the powers at six-month intervals, are essential components of this legislation. And, once this crisis is over, we should remind the powers that be that the extraordinary powers with which the state has armed itself are just that mdash out of the ordinary.Mr Johnson will be aware of the cautionary account given by Livy of Lucius Manlius Imperiosus, appointed dictator in BC to tackle a plague opinion on the epidemiological usefulness of this measure has moved on, who then got too full of himself, and was removed from office and put on trial. The Prime Minister no doubt intends to cast himself more in the mould of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, who, after being appointed dictator in BC, swtly achieved victory, immediately renounced his powers and retired back to his smallholding.The reason that we remember Cincinnatus, and cities are named after him, however, is because his example is such an unusual one. Lord Actonrsquos line about what absolute power tends to do corresponds far more to the normal pattern.Despite that, therersquos a surprising level of idiotic approvalof quite despotic powers, from people who will tell you that ldquothere are no libertarians in an epidemic or that, whenever we face a crisis, the measures that we turn to are basically socialism in action. The objection of the Prime Ministerrsquos critics is not so much to sweeping powers, but the fact that hersquos the one who gets to employ them.Exceptional measures are either necessary or not, and whether you approve of the current governmentrsquos other policies doesnrsquot come into that. If, when the exceptional circumstances have passed, such powers ought to be rescinded, itrsquos because they offer too much power to the government of the day mdash and they do so whatever its political colour.As it happens, we might just as easily learn the opposite lesson from what has happened in response to the pandemic. Some of the action to help us deal with the situation has been a matter of relaxing regulation mdash for example, allowing restaurants and bars to work on a delivery and takeaway basis without applying for a dferent licence, recognising the qualications of retired medical professionals, or paring back the bureaucracy around, to take only a few examples, sick leave, council powers over care duties, death certicates, tax credits, freelance tax s, VAT payments and housing benefit.At a more informal level, too, itrsquos already apparent that some things which have been considered normal practice are less than vital: commuting and face-to-face meetings turn out not to be necessary to many industries, which may even be more productive without them. And despite the irresponsibility of panic buyers, even parts of the economy that cannot be conducted remotely, such as the food supply chain, seem fairly resilient and adaptable.When the time comes to challenge police powers to shut down public gatherings, or other examples of what would normally be overreach, but most of us concede are currently essential, we may also want to consider whether those regulations that were quickly and easily dropped to cope with the crisis were all that useful in the first place.There is a danger of seeing the coronavirus crisis as a way of vindicating all sorts of changes that happen to correspond with the political priorities you already hold. Irsquove seen arguments that it proves the case for almost any hobby-horse: universal basic income, nationalising the railways, increasing teachersrsquo pay, abolishing zero-hours contracts, introducing bans on vaping and junk food and, inevitably, stopping Brexit.We will not be able to know what mistakes have been madein dealing with this pandemic until we have the benefit of hindsight. Nor is it likely that current predictions of quite how the world will change as a result of it are going to be accurate mdash evenwe assume that the world will almost certainly be changed by it.Butwe accept ndash as most responsible people now do mdash that strange and dangerous times justy extreme measures, and demand sacrices and altruistic responses from each of us, then it is because we understand that the circumstances are unprecedented. When we get back to normal, whatever the new normal turns out to be, we must insist that our laws and freedoms do as well.Read more: New figures confirm four more deaths as a result of pandemic"},{"url":null,"title":"jeanne-freemans-coronavirus-advice-right---not-exceptional","story":"That, in order to effect real and vital change in the world, you could just sit on your behind, let your blubber settle and do absolutely diddly squat all.Imagine no longer!

Here weve been stuck indoors over a long and storm laden winter. Now, finally, the weather has turned and we had two beautul, crisp, sunny days to play with.Yet we werent meant to play with them. We were meant to stand at the window and gaze out at them, forlornly.The government advice is that a walk outside is good for you so, like others and understandably, I tried on Sunday to go for a walk. The park was hoaching with people and keeping a solid two metre distance was not possible so I ed home.Thats part of the problem with social distancing - it only workseveryone gets on board. If some of us are weaving about and leaping out of the way like Jumping Frenchmen of Maine while others wander blindly in our path, its not effective.The messages from the English and Scottish governments is also conflicting. Late on Saturday night - far too late - Boris Johnson advised that people should not visit their mums for Mothers Day. Stay put, he advised.Scotlands National Clinical Director Jason Leitch, who is excellent, calm, measured and clear, gave his three-step advice for Mothers Day. Dont visit, he said, or try to have a video all with mum. Butyou do visit then wash your hands, have mum wash her hands, and stay two metres away from each other.The upshot was everyone translating the advice dferently - some insisting you cant visit your mother at all, others saying it would be fine.On Friday night Mr Leitch appeared on BBC Scotlands The Nine and said visiting the hairdressers was fine, as salons tend to be one of the more sanitary places you can visit. On Monday Nicola Sturgeon said hair salons should close.The messaging is not straightforward. \"Social distancing\" is relatively meaningless. I saw a great tweet asking why the messaging isnt \"the two metre rule\" - much easier to grasp.What really is easy to grasp, though, is that we should stay at home unless for vital journeys or a bit of solo exercise. All  is paused for now.If you have symptoms and live with other people then  days at home and dont cross the doorstep. Ive come across people who have symptoms and are going out and about as usual. That is unconscionable. Why are they doing it  Because they dont think the rules apply to them and, while they have symptoms, they dont believe them to really be Covid-.Its really moot, for the purposes of the behaviour of the general public, whether its Covid- or not. This is not the time for self-diagnosis or taking chances because you believe yourself to be the exception to the rule.Jeane Freeman MSP put it beautully: \"You are neither an exception nor exceptional.\"This is not the time for bending the rules to suit your bespoke and special circumstances. This is the time for knuckling down and doing exactly whats asked. If you have symptoms and you go outside then your actions could be responsible for a death. Being stuck indoors when the sun is shining is rubbish. Is it worth making other people gravely ill The advice to just stay in your house is more dficult when you live with people you dont particularly like or you have flatmates who are a pain in the behind. Its frightening advice when you live with someone who is abusive.But for the majority of us it just means a prolonged spell of slight tedium, perhaps with some whining weans wed like a break from.

Save lives.Because the UK does not have an emergency alert system, network operators are sending out the text on behalf of the Government, resulting in it arriving at dferent times.Trials of a text alert system were run in  and were apparently successful, with a final report highlighting strong public support for the idea.: Coronavirus: Wetherspoons boss tells staff to get a job at TescoThe report also concluded that such a system would be ldquoan effective way of getting people to take specic protective action during an emergency, though it was never implemented.South Korearsquos success in slowing the spread of Covid- has been at least partly attributed to an aggressive text messaging system deployed by the country, where alerts were sent out detailing the movements of people who had tested positive.In the UK, the NHS has also started to send out messages to people it recognises as most vulnerable to the virus and urged them to remain at home for at least  weeks.But the alerts come as cyber security experts encourage people to be aware of potentially malicious texts and emails, where criminals pose as official agencies to try and elicit personal information from users.The UKrsquos National Cyber Security Centrehas warned of increased activity of this type, highlighting incidents where clicking on links in bogus emails claiming to have important updates has led to devices being infected.These ldquophishing attempts can lead to victims being left out of pocket or stripped of sensitive data.NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said: ldquoWe know that cyber criminals are opportunistic and will look to exploit peoplersquos fears, and this has undoubtedly been the case with the coronavirus outbreak.ldquoOur advice to the public is to follow our guidance, which includes everything from password advice to spotting suspect emails."},{"url":null,"title":"rishi-sunak-delays-uk-government-spending-review-ministers-can-focus-tackling-coronavirus-emergency","story":"The CSR, which sets departmental spending limits for the next three years, was set to conclude in July but could now be postponed until the autumn or possibly even longer.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.Ian T # South Korea has followed WHO guidelines, testing more people per capita than anywhere , and the number of new cases there has dropped drastically.The country recorded  new cases of Covid- yesterday, compared with a peak of  cases on February th.I understand there is every chance the virus will spread again in South Koreaonce social contact restrictions are lted, but at the very least their efforts to contain the spread has bought them more time.More time to make sure their NHS and other essential services are prepared as well as possible. More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  .

It is as simple as that.This Virus can not get to youyou do that simple thing. It is not rocket science!!!Yes it can, via an envelope retrieved from a mailbox, groceries and any other items brought into your home that have been handled by other people.There are some strategies you may employ to minimize risk of contamination.Wear disposable gloves when retrieving mail, disinfect the mail before bringing it into your house.Junk mail should go directly from the mailbox to the bin. Retrieve mail only every two to three days to minimize exposure.As to groceries, avoid fresh produce.Wear disposable gloves when shopping.Only buy canned or frozen items and sanitize them before putting into storage.Ideally, buy enough that you can rotate the stock.Use only grocery items, canned or frozen that have been in your possession for  days or more.On the other handyou literally stay in your house and not opened the door to anyone or thing, for the next month or two, or three, or four# the virus probably will not be able to get to you.

Sandi B - Make the world go around. I love happy dance tunes. I’ve great memories at Kelly’s  Circus when this tuuuuuuunnnnnee came on. . The Cult - She sells Sanctuary. No other reason than this should only be listened too at full volume. Lethal car tune. Many odd looks at traffic lights when I have this on! . Pink Floyd - Shine on you crazy diamonds. I had the pleasure of seeing Pink Floyd in London mid ’s with one of my oldest friends.I love their music but this song always reminds me of that concert and the mental weekend. . The Fureys - I will love you. This is a breathtaking love song.I imagine this is how my parents were. . Sylvester - Do ya Wanna Funk  This is my No dance tune.It reminds me of our disco dance team at Ballykeel youth club.Later during our Rave years BinMan used to play this as a mix.It was lethal. I left all those tapes behind when I moved back from England. A huge regret.I’d love to hear them again. Especially this mix. . Glee cast - Oh Holy Night. This is thee most beautul Hymn.I love the lead up to Christmas. It’s a constant in my house. On repeat! I gave off to my girls about watching yet more American rubbish and then became utterly addicted to Glee myself. Their covers are often better than the originals. . Donna Summer - McArthur ParkIn our house I would have frequent discos with my girls.We didn’t have much and often le was hard but we always danced and put on shows. It’s was disco, disco, disco!We had to see who could hold the Note the longest. A few years back Santa brought me a new record player and the girls bought me this album.It’s still a favourite with the  of us. They still love the ‘old’ tunes. . James Arthur - Falling like the stars. I love James Arthur.This song is another level. It reminds me of my partner. . Eurthymics - Here comes the rain again. Another one that should only be played with serious volume. Annie Lennox was so cool. I aspired to have her hair styles.I loved so many of their songs and I still do. . Fleetwood Mac - Songbird. My Shared No album.I got the record again a few years ago and listening to this with the crackle of the record player is a rush of memories Reo Speedwagon ‘Hi Infidelity’ is the other No album I know every word to.

We watched as petrol bombs were made on a makefht production line and stored behind the barricade at the top of Ramoan Gardens. Young as we were, we knew that this was an epoch-making time.My most vivid memory from those franticfew days in August is of Patcheye Doyle standing on the roof of a Morris  which was caving in under his weight. His one eye dancing, he was roaring at a gathering of local men, urging them to get organised before the next onslaught. A fearsome and fearless scrapper of some reknown, Patcheye took the lead while others dithered. He was a hard man, in a time when that epithet was more than a throwaway schoolyard taunt.And of course, there was real fear abroad. There were no weapons to hold off an invasion, no police force to turn to for protection.And yet, the people did pull together defences, after a fashion. Barricades went up, British Army ‘ex-servies’ patrolled the streets and the people turned to each other for support and comfort.Mistakes were made too in the maelstrom. Some concerned matters of le and death, others were less consequential but remain with me: I remember the proud pine trees on the Glen Road being cut down to block the road. You can still seethe gaps where they once stood – and where their more fortunate cousins continue to watch over us.And, yet,we survived. Not in one piece, admittedly. But we emerged on the other side. Changed for sure, stronger undoubtedly but also scarred.And so what I can retrieve from thoseall-but forgotten memories of the heady days of August ’ to help us as we march headlong into this coming Cornavirus hurricane  Well, put up the barricades. Protect your neighbour. Gear up for the fight.But most of all, listen to the key men and women – those selfless heroes who we will find today not on car roofs but in the hospital emergency rooms and the Intensive Care Units. They have given us fair warning: keep your distance, isolate and defend the elderly, wash your hands and, above all , stay at home.I can put it no better than in the words of a -year-old paper boy who arrived, complete with surgical gloves, to the Andersonstown News offices last week insisting that he be allowed to do his door-to-doorpaper round — which we had cancelled in light of the crisis. Pointinga gloved finger at me, he said, “I will knock the f*** out of this Coronavirus.” Patcheye must be smiling down.Today it’s not Shankill against Falls or unionist versus nationalist. It’s all of us, one people, one city, and one battle which we cannot and which we most certainlyWILL NOTlose."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus nearly 600 ryobi workers put on","story":"Reports Ryobi has temporarily put staff on leave.

When am I allowed to leave the house A. Rules state that leaving the house should be kept to a minimum or as infrequently as possible, as Boris Johnson said during his televised address. It is only permitted when getting to and from work“absolutely necessary”, attending a medical appointment or buying necessities.You will also be able to leave the house once a day for exercise, such as running or cycling. This should be done alone, unless it is with members of your household.If you provide care or help to a vulnerable person you will also be able to leave home for this purpose.If you are a “key worker”, such as a police officer or nurse, and your child children are attending school, you will be able to dropped them off and pick them up.Q. The UK Government says I must only to travel to and from work“absolutely necessary” - how do I knowit is “absolutely necessary” A. All those who are able to work from home have been advised to do so, however for many jobs this is not possible. Those providing essential services or goods will still be able to travel to and from work. Social distancing rules, however, should still be enforced. This means you should stay at least two metres apart from anyone and work gatherings should not take place.Q. Will the children of orced parents be able to visit both of them Cabinet minister the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has confirmed that children under  can move between the households of separated parents, as long as this is normal practice.Q. Can I attend any outside events A. All social events, such as weddings or baptisms, will not be allowed to go ahead. Funerals will be permitted with only immediate family members in attendance. All social gatherings of more than two people will also be prohibited.Q. What businesses are allowed to remain open A. Only businesses providing essential goods or services will be permitted to stay open. In the food and drink industry, this includes restaurants operating takeaway or delivery services and canteens at hospitals, care homes, schools and prisons.Facilities offering food or drink to the homeless are also permitted.All retail shops will shut, except for supermarkets and other food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, hardware shops and laundrettes.Pet shops, newsagents and banks can also remain open.Businesses that are permitted to stay open have been asked to ensure a distance of two meters is kept between customers and shop assistants, to only let people enter in small groups, and to introduce queue control measures outside the premises.Hotels, hostels and BBs can only remain open for those guests staying while their primary residence is unavailable. Key workers can also continue to stay at such accommodation.Q. How will these measures be enforced A. Police will have the power to disperse public gatherings and issue fines, however it is unclear how officers will monitor whether people are breaking the rules, what action will then be taken, and how much the fines will be.Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will enforce the rules regarding businesses. Those found to be breaking the rules can be subject to prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines.Q. How long will the restrictions be in place for A. The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks, at which time they will be reviewed. At this stage they could be relaxed or tightened.Many have speculated that the restrictions will be in force for longer than three weeks, such as First Minister Arlene Foster.“If I was a betting person, I would say it would continue long after three weeks.

It had to be unique and it had to be of a spec that would appeal to the decision makers at Apple, James says.“We thought about how we, as desk workers, have all the tools at our disposal, on our laptop and tools that help us collaborate, but whatyou work in retail, manufacturing and transport  Those sectors have a huge percentage of their workforce that don’t work at a desk and probably don’t even have a work email account.”James and his team, which now amounts to  staff, created Thrive.App to serve that working community and today they have almost a quarter-of-a-million employees across  global firms using the app from their smart devices.“When we looked at businesses we saw that up to % were using noticeboards and line manager briefings to communicate with staff. It hadn’t moved on in  years and this app would be revolutionary for those kinds of workplaces,” adds James.“The thinking is, today you can’t buy any phone other than a smartphone, and in the UK % of people have one, and that was the driver. The employees of those non-desk sectors have the devices but the employers didn’t have the channel so we provided one that would allow them to update it themselves.”James says the app equates to a cost outlay of £. per employee per month for its customers.“We are seeing a lot more smaller organisations looking to get set up on it and what’s key is they can get up and running in a day or two at a very low cost to them, and that business model seems to work well.”Since the outbreak of the coronavirus James has seen business boom. He says: “We’ve seen a real increase and last week was a real shellshock week for people. We are mindful and sensitive to what’s going on around us and we have noted that a lot more of our clients are relying on remote communication.“We had enquiries from Florida and Thailand in one day, but that’s indicative of a normal week, and I think the coronavirus has sharpened people’s attention to how we communicate and they’re asking questions like: do we have the methods in place ”The Covid- outbreak isn’t the first external event that has brought businesses’ attention to remote communication tools like Thrive.App. James says last winter’s influx of storms saw many firms put systems in place as a safety precaution.Among Thrive.app’s larger client base is SSE, which has over , employees, as well as Moy Park and Carlsberg. An Post and Henderson Group are also among its customers in Ireland, as well as a healthcare provider in Calornia and, more recently, a Brazilian firm.James’ interest in IT was supported by his parents in his early years at school.Raised in Lisburn, James studied at Wallace High. He believes he is the product of a “great education system” and recalls the school’s first computer with great fondness and a feeling of being “privileged”.His mum, a homemaker, and dad, a former photographer, were very supportive of his passion for what was a relatively new sector back then. They bought a PC for the home encouraging James’ pastime and later he went on to study computer science at Queen’s University.“I never really enjoyed the academic side of learning but during university I built websites for people on the side and it was a like a lightbulb went on. Work experience during the course was a great experience for me. I went to a company called Apion, a telecom software firm, and they were writing the first mobile internet gateway in the world.”Travelling globally, from Tokyo to San Diego, further fuelled James’ passion for tech and nurtured his skillset.“When I left Queen’s I went back and forth to Silicon Valley working with some very bright people. As a Queen’s graduate, it was an exceptional experience and when the dot bubble came and burst I was fortunate enough to have my own tech start-up.”Looking at the gap between technology and education, James is hopeful more partnerships between companies and education authorities will cultivate a stream of skills for the future.He says: “The school system is still very results-driven, but you need people with not just the theory, but practical and mentoring abilities. I think it’s things like modern apprenticeships that will help and encourage people to come into the industry. We would love to see more primary school children use technology more, and use apps that improve on what’s there already.”James, a father-of-three, believes having supportive parents is key to success. He adds: “When I look back I see how important my parents’ support was so I encourage my daughter to do coding and to use the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyScratch App. It’s great for fostering an interest, and during a time when we will be looking for things to keep our children occupied this is great.“I think working le has become a challenge and carving out time is dficult, but something like this resets our priorities and whenever we come out of it, what ever we can learn, we should enjoy the time we have to spend with our children.“We have a saying at work and it’s: ‘Don’t just survive, but thrive.’ And I don’t think that could be any more appropriate right now.”Q What was your best business decision A Gaining as much ied work experience as early on in my career as possible, to learn lots and discover what I really enjoyed doing. Taking the opportunity to live and work outside of Northern Ireland for a few years gave great perspective, too. Q If you weren’t doing this job, what would be your other career  A I have a real passion for using technology to solve problems, so I’m pretty sure I would apply my knowledge and experience in another field — Formula  would be the dream. I was fortunate to visit the Williams Formula  team last year and met Frank Williams himself. Q What are your hobbies interests  A Growing up I was a huge motorsport fan, in particular Formula . I would have never missed a race, but became bored of it over the last few years and stopped watching. I’m glad to say the Netflix series Drive To Survive has recently rekindled my interest, lting the lid on what really goes on behind closed doors in the teams. Q How would you describe your early le  A I always enjoyed discovering new things, whether that was computers from an early age, taking things apart to see how they worked and hacking them into new gadgets. I was fortunate to grow up in a supportive environment with lots of opportunities to do those things. Q How do you sum up working in the tech sector  A It’s a really exciting time to work in the tech sector anywhere. The advances we have made over the last  years compared to the previous decades are pretty mind-blowing when you pause to think. The fact that %-plus of the population are carrying such a sophisticated device in their pocket and using it for so much of their daily lives is a massive sht.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

virus on workers and employers with more stringent social distancing rules.Gatherings of more than four people are being restricted as part of the tough new measures to combat the virus.All theatres, gyms, hairdressers, casinos and bingo halls are to close.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said all existing coronavirus measures including the closure of schools will be extended until Sunday April .Mr Varadkar thanked the public for listening to the advice on physical distancing and hand washing so far.He said It#s too early to know for sure but we do believe it#s making a dference.However we do believe we need to do more.He said he was asking people to stay at homeat all possible.Mr Varadkar said people should only leave home to go to work,they can#t work from home, to get essential supplies and to take physical exercise.No unnecessary travel is to be taken within the country or overseas, the Taoiseach said.All non-essential retail outlets are to close to members of the public, while restaurants and cafes are to limit to takeaway only.These are unprecedented actions to an unprecedented time, Mr Varadkar said.We#re in this in for the long haul, and this could go on for weeks.There will be increased patrols by park rangers and the gardaí to make sure physical distancing is being practised in public areas.Mr Varadkar said new powers will only be used when necessary.He said that Ireland recently commemorated the centenary of the  Rising and the men and women that won Ireland#s independence.He said he never believed we would be called upon to match their courage or example but we are now working as a country to respond to this emergency.He said: our greatest generation is not in the past and added better times are yet to come.Emergency welfare payment for workers who have lost their jobs due to the coronavirus crisis will increase to € per week.And in a signicant new move the Government will also pay % of employee wages up to € per week for businesses who are willing to meet the remainder of their staff’s weekly payment.Last week, the Irish Government introduced the Covid- Pandemic Unemployment Payment which was initially set at € per week.However, the Cabinet on Tuesday agreed to signicantly increase the payment for those who are out of work due the Government’s demand that businesses close during the crisis.The payment, which is available to employees and self-employed workers who are down income because of the coronavirus, will now increase to € per week.The Government is also planning to announce a new payment for companies whose income has dropped by % but still want to retain their staff.In these cases, the State will pay % of employee salaries up to € per week and the company will be asked to pay the remaining %.The Irish Congress of Trade Unionshas also proposed a €.bn plan in which the State would pay % of wages for three months, up to €, of pay per worker.Meanwhile, the school and college shutdown is being extended until Monday April  at the earliest, but no decision has been taken in relation to the State written exams in June.The Leaving Cert and Junior Cycle exams are still scheduled to go ahead as normal, but that could change, depending on the spread of Covid- in the community.In the worst case scenario, schools would notuntil end of August  September, more than five months after closing their doors on March .The extended shutdown leaves little time for post-primary schools, which wrap up by the end of May, to resume in a meaningful way in the current academic year.The primary school year continues to the end of June, so that offers more latitude for a resumption of classes at the country’s , primary schools,circumstances allow.Some , students are entered for the June exams – , due to sit the Leaving Cert and , at Junior Cycle level.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the extension as part of a wider package of measures to restrict the spread of the virus.The Government is also to introduce emergency legislation to allow retired soldiers re-join the Defence Forces.The new laws have been in the pipe line for a number of months but are now being fast-tracked as part of the Government’s response to the Covid- pandemic.The Defence Forces are preparing for a greater role in the State’s response to the national health crisis and the legislation will clear the path for retired soldiers toto service.Defence Minister Paul Kehoe brought an amendment to the Defence Act to Cabinet ahead of the Dáil holding an emergency sitting on Thursday.It is unclear how many ex-soldiers will seek to re-join the Defence Forces but there is understood to be some interest among retired security personnel in taking part in the State’s fight against the virus.The new measures in Ireland come after

I knew every song, she laughs, taking a drag of her vape.The teacher told me to go and get my book. I said, I dont need it and she said, Go and get your book and I said, Shove it up your arse.She came back looking for me, but I never went back.Derry was always going to be too small for Noella and at  she headed to London with her guitar on her back and gigs with the likes of Van Morrison already under her belt.There was nothing here in , she says.I would have done anything to escape.Not long after she arrived, The NoellaHuttonBand landed a residency at Madame JoJos, a legendary Soho strip club frequented by actors and popstars.Youd have people like Robbie Williams, theyd all come in there mincing about, says Noella.Before we went on wed be sitting in the green room with two totally naked strippers.But it was just normal. It wasnt a big deal. It was just work and they were so professional.Mariah Carey came in one night and she tried to move my friends from the front seats and I said, Naw, thats my friends there.She asked meI had a demo and I said naw. Honestly, I just didnt want to give her anything, she smiles.Boy George was another regular and after watching her play, he asked her to sign to his label More Protein.He said to me, No one has ever scared me before, but you scare me, she recalls.So, you signed with Boy George Naw.One of things he said to me was, So, youre a big dyke then That got my back up right away. I said George, my sexuality has got f**k all to do with what I am.Its such a small, small part of who I am.And its really nobodys business. It wasnt because I was ashamed, I just thought, Im not going to ride on the back of that honey.If he hadnthave said that, who knows  But it just wasnt meant for me.The pair still hit it off and Noella sang with Boy George at a string of gigs in Shepherds Bush Empire, dueting on a punk version of Karma Chameleon.They also enjoyed wild nights out together, where people used to confuse them for brother and sister.He was a good guy - very intelligent.And he loved me and he was so proud of me.Noella was having the time of her le, singing at Paul OGradys thbut still working at Camden Market on the weekends to make ends meet.She was hanging out with the likes of Oasis, Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence and the buzz around her was starting to grow.Then she got the call that would change her le.It was from the head of Radioactive Records who had signed the likes of Garbage and Debbie Harry.He asked me how much I wanted, I could barely afford to make it to the bus stop, she laughs.Radioactive asked Noella who she wanted to produce her album and she chooseJerry Harrison of Talking Heads, who had just produced for the American rock band Lives album Throwing Copper.The label flew her to LA to record it and soon she was living the American dream with a substantial advance and her own cab driver who was on call around the clock.I was just happy to be able to do stuff for people, she says.Sure whats the point of having money  You cant take it with you.Noella released her self titled album NoellaHutton in , toured extensively in the States and was put up in the likes of New Yorks Cha Hotel.I slept the best I ever have in my le when I was in New York, she says.It was just the characters.

Thats very important. Youre only here for a wee while.Fame never interested me. It was terrying.I knew too many people who were miserable and had no le.I had too much badness to get up to.And what a le Noella was having. She was dating Taryn Manningand her album was No  on the playlist of the Virgin record store in Hollywood.She was living the kind of le most of us can only dream of, but her mental health was suffering and in  Noella suffered a complete nervous breakdown.Everything just crashed in my head at the one time, she says with characteristic frankness.It all closed in at the one time.I had just been putting it off my whole le.Everything that had went on reared its head.Id had a breakdown in London too, but this was on a dferent scale.It was just trauma. You think youve dealt with certain things. But naw, you havent.Im amazed that Im still here to be honest.Noellas sister, JeanetteHutton, brought her back to Derry, where she worked very hard to get better with the help of Gransha Hospital and the support of her family.A couple of years later she met American singer songwriter and producer Justin Black, who had her album as a teenager growing up in Arkansas.He said my album inspired him to play the guitar, she laughs.He didnt even know I was Irish.She also formed the band Blood with her sister Jeanette and brother-in-law Ruairi ODoherty and two years ago they released an album of the same name.Shes the eldest girl in the family and Im the youngest and all we do is laugh at stupid sh***, said Noella.Shes so loved. Shes brilliant. Shes my hero.In recent years Noella has also channelled her energy into animal rescue charity Friends of Rescue founded by her best friend Suzanne Fleming.Together with Suzanne, Keith Rutherford and Carly Russell, Noella helps rescue and rehome neglected and abused animals.The day before yesterday we rescued  dogs, she said.Its the most rewarding, heartbreaking, devastating, incredible all-encompassing thing.Im fearless when it comes to the well being of animals, children or old people.Noella is now sponsored by world-renowned bespoke guitar makers Emerald Guitars, who are based in St Johnston.Justin persuaded her to record her recently released solo album Love and Liars which deserves to be heard on the world stage, but Noella has no plans for a big tour.Ive honestly never made a plan in my le, she says.I dont believe in forcing squaresinto circles, do you know what I mean Its something that has to happenorganically, naturally.And this feels right at the minute.To find out more about Noella, visit her Facebook page The First Noella.Her music is available at noellahutton.bandcampA documentary about Noellas le, The First Noella, made by Justin Black is now available on YouTube.If you would like to support Friends of Rescue you can find them at Friends of Rescue Ireland on Facebook.For more information on Emerald Guitars visitwww.emeraldguitars googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Stockpiles of Personal Protective Equipmentwere said to be making its way to frontline healthcare workers but those in retail appear to be the ‘forgotten frontline’. The Derry News has spoken to workers in dferent stores who have had to bring their own hand sanitisers or other protective equipment to work. PPE shortages are understood to be widespread across the health service and also include GP practices. The government has made clear that it is making efforts to deliver emergency supplies to hospitals. googletag.cmd.push However, retail workers who are serving thousands of customers every day in a pressurised environment as a consequence of panic-buying have been somewhat overlooked. They are on the frontline too, trade unionists say, and face daily abuse from angry customers upset over food shortages. The Derry News contacted the major supermarkets based in the city to ask what ‘specic measures’ they have put in place to protect staff. In response, Andrew Opie, Director of Food  Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents all the major supermarkets except for Tesco, said workers have been briefed on ‘strict hand washing’. “Retailers are continuing to adhere to high standards of hygiene, and all employees are fully briefed with measures including strict hand washing policies. This remains the best way of protecting staff and customers,” he explained. googletag.cmd.push When asked to expand on ‘specic measures’ being implemented, a spokesperson for the consortium said that some have drawn up ‘rotas to allow employees to wash their hands at regular intervals’. Meanwhile, Tesco gave assurances that the safety of its customers, colleagues and suppliers is its ‘number one priority’. Strict health and safety processes are said to be in place in its stores and its supply chain and the retail giant is directing all colleagues and suppliers to follow public health authority guidance on how to keep themselves, fellow colleagues and customers safe. Again, it could not say whether hand sanitisers, gloves, masks or other protective equipment would be provided to ensure staff are adequately protected. PROTECTION Derry Trades Union CouncilChairperson Niall McCarroll has called on all supermarket owners and management to provide workers with ‘adequate and fit for purpose’ PPE. He said COVID- will bring many challenges and changes to how we go about our daily working lives. “Some workers will be able to remain at home and shelter against the fast approaching virus. Signicant numbers won’t have the luxury of remaining at home. “Frontline workers is the term used to describe those of us who must face COVID-, keeping keep vital services operating, basically keeping people alive. “One group of frontline workers who are particularly at risk and largely forgotten are supermarket workers. “These workers need protected and above all  they need valued and respected by their employers. “Over recent years supermarket workers have suffered with their terms and conditions of employment being attacked and devalued. With company sick pay being hit hard through cuts from the bosses.” RESPECT DTUC has therefore called on the Retail Consortium to reverse all cuts to workers terms and conditions, by taking control and showing leadership at this time. Mr McCarroll said: “DTUC are calling for full sick pay to be paid to all supermarket workers who are self-isolating or caring for someone at risk. Full sick pay to be paid to all staff regardless ofof service. “For those workers who would be considered to be vulnerable to Coronavirus, those over , any worker with underlying health conditions and pregnant workers should be allowed to self-isolate and work from homethey wish. “These measures would be seen as in the public interest and widely supported. Frontline workers must come before profit.” He continued: “All supermarket workers must also have access to adequate and fit for purpose Personal Protective Equipment. Risk assessments, and widespread testing of all workers within this sector must be seen as a priority. “DTUC ask all members of the public to back the call for supermarket workers to be valued and protected. “Practice social distancing when in store and in the absence of respect from the bosses, show respect to these workers, without them things would be signicantly more dficult.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scoreline didnt do the Derry kingpins justice, Their tremendous determination and work-rate was enough to see them overwhelm Errigal Ciaran. The Tones never really let the Tyrone champions get a snf of glory. They trailed by - to - at half-time, but that scoreline disguised the fact that they dominated possession in the first half despite battling against a huge wind. The problem was they couldnt score. They hit seven wides to Errigals three in the first half, missed an open goal chance after  minutes, and failed to capitalise on the fact that they won nearly twice as many frees in the opening half. googletag.cmd.push In contrast, the Errigal Ciaran attack, with Eamon McCaffrey at full-forward and Chris Quinn filling the vacant spot at centre-forward, feasted well on the few crumbs of possession they received. As expected, Bellaghy dispatched David ONeill to mark the legendary Peter Canavan at corner-forward. He looked to have his hands full when, after five minutes, The Great fired over a trademark point to open the scoring. But thereafter, Canavan rarely got the better of the Derry county defender who completely dominated him in the air. ONeill received some brilliant support, particularly from corner-back and man of the match Peter Diamond and half-backs Cathal Diamond, Ciaran McNally and Kevin Doherty. googletag.cmd.push Errigal still looked dangerous up front, their scant possession yielding brilliant points from Eoin Gormleyand Peter Loughran. Bellaghy were left wonderingtheyd rue the Louis McPeake fumble which cost them a great goal chance in the opening quarter, after Fergal Doherty and Cathal Scullion had combined to create the opening. Seamus Birts timely introduction of Joe Cassidy greatly increased their powers of penetration. Errigal Ciaran werent helped when driving rain and dimming light, with a . throw-in and a lack of floodlights. The Bellaghy forwards got braver when the second half began. Three superb long-range frees in as many minutes from Gavin Diamond gave them the confidence they needed to capitalise on their possession. Points from Francis Glackin and Cassidy saw them surge three points clear by the th minute. And with key men like Karl Diamond funnelling back to defend in packs, they kept the Tyrone champions scoreless for  minutes of the second half until Mark Hartes consolation goal in injury time.

From this evening people must stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, daily exercise, any medical need and travelling to and from essential work. Shops selling non-essential goods will also be shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together prohibited. The UK death toll has reached . It was announced this evening that a third person has died from the disease in Northern Ireland. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Boris Johnson said in a televised statement from Downing Street. googletag.cmd.push The Department of Health said the third patient to die in Northern Ireland was in their late sixties and had underlying health conditions. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “My heart goes out to the loved ones of this patient. “This is the third tragic announcement of this kind I have had to make in recent days. “The lethal threat from this virus is very real and we all have to do everything we can to combat it.” Below is Boris Johnstons full address this evening:  Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. googletag.cmd.push All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen where, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply,too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it – meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope – and save more lives. And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. And though huge numbers are complying – and I thank you all – the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: – shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible – one form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household – any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person and – travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That’s all – these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine — and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: – close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship – we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with – and we’ll stop all social events , including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with , former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy – by simply staying at home – we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together, to halt the spread of this disease, to protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together. And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.

McCourt and his family made the decision to self isolate almost two weeks ago, after seeing how the spread of the coronavirus has affected other countries throughout the world, and he encouraged the people of his hometown city to heed the professional advice. “If you look at the consistency of all the reports, you can see that you can help everybody by doing the simple things like washing your hands, only going outyou have to go out, not socialising and not going for needless visits,” he said. “If youre helping an older relative or helping someone like a neighbour who cant get out for groceries, then thats fine, but dont just be calling to your mates house to play the Playstation or have a beer. “I think people really need to start listening to the advice were being given because its coming to a critical time.

That would be the worry so as a football club we decided not to. “I suppose were very lucky to have equipment to monitor the players from home.

In that respect theres a bit of trust there from staff to players, but on a wider issue, it is really important for people to listen to the advice they are being given on a daily basis.

You can go for walks thats the one thing Ive been doing every day,” he explained.“We go for a good long walk, all of us together, and when were out we pick up what we need and were back home. Were probably only out  minutes of the day but thats what we need to do for the foreseeable future. “Hopefully some day well look back on it and say these were crazy times and we got through them unscathed. It is a period of two or three months andyou keep the brain active and keep feeling safe, thats more important at the minute than sport.”McCourt caused something of a reaction on Twitter over the weekend when he stated that he would be getting back into football when this scare ended. The Derry Pele has claried his statement.“I think people picked that up wrong, in terms of trying to come back and playing, certainly not,” he laughed. “What I meant by that is that Im going to get back onto it, playing -a-side or -a-side once this all blows over. In the last  months since I retired, I went straight into that job at Derry, which was very, very time-consuming and still is. “When this does blow over Im definitely going to get back into some kind of playing, whether its just a mess about or playing amateur, because I do miss it now.“Over the last two weeks, weve all had loads and loads of time to think and I probably havent had that time to reflect since retiring because I was out of one job and into the next and it was full steam ahead with that.

The date for a potentialto League of Ireland action was set by the Football Association of Ireland and the National League Executive Committee this past weekend in the wake of the Covid- pandemic.The decision was made at a tele-conference conducted from FAI HQ at Abbotstown on Friday, with all  League clubs represented. Both parties agreed to work together to play as many games as possible this season to minimise the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on attendances and sponsorship, and to consider the needs of clubs who have qualied for Europe.The new plan is based around UEFA guidelines on ato club action across Europe, as presented to the FAI last Tuesday. This decision will see the Premier Division and the First Division of the SSE Airtricity League resume on the weekend commencing Friday, June . The Premier Division will finish on Friday, December  and the SSE Airtricity League season will close on Friday, December , with the second leg of the promotion relegation play-off. The Extra.ie FAI Cup Final will go ahead as scheduled on November , whilst the EA SPORTS Cup will be deferred.The new schedule will require the cancellation of the last round of fixtures in the Premier Division, now reduced to  games in total. Changes to the dates for European club fixtures may force alterations to the new calendar of games as the season develops and this will be continually reviewed.The First Division clubs will examine the possibility of fulfilling their -game schedule within this timeframe from June to December.Welcoming the decision, FAI Competitions Director Fran Gavin said: “These are very dficult times for our clubs and players and the FAI remains committed to doing everything we can to get us all through this crisis together.“There are no certainties around the COVID- pandemic but this decision offers us something to aim for. UEFA hope to have European football back up and running by early June at the latest so June  is a realistic target for us at this moment in time.“Together with the clubs and the Professional Footballer’s Association of Ireland, we will work together towards this date and continue to liaise with the NLEC and the PFAI to protect our clubs and players as best we can.“The FAI will continue to work with the Department of Health and the HSE to prioritise the health of our players, match officials, supporters and staff at this time and we will continue to follow all government guidelines.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The date for a potentialto League of Ireland action was set by the Football Association of Ireland and the National League Executive Committee this past weekend in the wake of the Covid- pandemic.The decision was made at a tele-conference conducted from FAI HQ at Abbotstown on Friday, with all  League clubs represented. Both parties agreed to work together to play as many games as possible this season to minimise the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on attendances and sponsorship, and to consider the needs of clubs who have qualied for Europe.The new plan is based around UEFA guidelines on ato club action across Europe, as presented to the FAI last Tuesday. This decision will see the Premier Division and the First Division of the SSE Airtricity League resume on the weekend commencing Friday, June . The Premier Division will finish on Friday, December  and the SSE Airtricity League season will close on Friday, December , with the second leg of the promotion relegation play-off. The Extra.ie FAI Cup Final will go ahead as scheduled on November , whilst the EA SPORTS Cup will be deferred.The new schedule will require the cancellation of the last round of fixtures in the Premier Division, now reduced to  games in total. Changes to the dates for European club fixtures may force alterations to the new calendar of games as the season develops and this will be continually reviewed.The First Division clubs will examine the possibility of fulfilling their -game schedule within this timeframe from June to December.Welcoming the decision, FAI Competitions Director Fran Gavin said: “These are very dficult times for our clubs and players and the FAI remains committed to doing everything we can to get us all through this crisis together.“There are no certainties around the COVID- pandemic but this decision offers us something to aim for. UEFA hope to have European football back up and running by early June at the latest so June  is a realistic target for us at this moment in time.“Together with the clubs and the Professional Footballer’s Association of Ireland, we will work together towards this date and continue to liaise with the NLEC and the PFAI to protect our clubs and players as best we can.“The FAI will continue to work with the Department of Health and the HSE to prioritise the health of our players, match officials, supporters and staff at this time and we will continue to follow all government guidelines.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational. He also hopes that councillors will be provided with an estimate of the cost of the repair work.ldquoThis is Downpatrickrsquos only public cemetery and I hope that once the insurers have completed their assessment and the Fire and Rescue Service report is discussed, that repairs can get underway, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe cemetery is widely used by people from across the district and while the scale of the damage was signicant, it is somewhat comforting that the blaze is being blamed on an electrical fault and was not as the result of an arson attack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cheltenham.jpg","title":"Cheltenham joy  ","story":"THERE was local success at the Cheltenham Festival last week.Ravenhill, bred in Comber by Aaron Metcalfe, won the National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival last Tuesday.The  year-old, ridden by leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd and trained by Gordon Elliott, romped home at  .

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our communities.Other councillors who spoke at Monday nightrsquos debate included Roisin Mulgrew, Michael Savage, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold

Fountain Foodbank has launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic.The cross-community facility mdash which has seen an upsurge in demand over recent days and handed out almost  food parcels last week mdash introduced the new service this week in the wake of Mondayrsquos advice from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that people should avoid all ldquonon essential contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon. The contact numbers are   or email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org.Newcastle and District Football League committee members are to donate food packs to the local food banks.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :.

The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.This week, Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon confirmed that work to install the new street lights in Castlewellan will be carried out in two phases.Phase one starts next Monday and will continue until Thursday, April , while phase two is scheduled to start on Monday, April  and conclude on May .Ms Mallon said she has made clear her commitment to address the issues which matter most to the people of Northern Ireland.ldquoStreet lighting services are crucial in ensuring those driving, cycling and walking can do so safely within their communities, the minister continued.ldquoThis investment provides new LED technology along Castlewellan Main Street. It is important that adequate street lighting not only improves the quality of lighting but is more energy efficient given my commitment to climate action.The government department has confirmed that during work on the scheme, a traffic management system will be in operation between .am and pm and between pm and pm from Monday to Friday.Roads officials say that they have programmed the work operations and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but motorists are advised to expect some delays and to allow additional time when travelling in the area.And in order to help ensure the safety of road users and contractors, drivers are asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with extra care when travelling in the vicinity of the works.News of the Castlewellan investment has been welcomed by South Down MLA Emma Rogan and Slieve Croob councillors Roiacutesiacuten Howell and Hugh Gallagher.Ms Rogan said that the investment not only will provide the latest LED technology and improve the quality of lighting, but will also be much more energy efficient. She said ldquoquality and adequate street lighting in local towns is essential for businesses and traders as well as pedestrians and other road users.Cllr Howell said while the investment is welcome, there are areas across the district awaiting street light repairs and have been for many many months. She urged Ms Mallon to make these a priority and ensure adequate investment is put into maintenance of street lighting.ldquoCertain areas have had light outages for several months and local residents are feeling very vulnerable, she added.Cllr Gallagher said the Castlewellan investment will ldquomake a dference and said it underscores the SDLP commitment to regionally balanced infrastructure.He added: ldquoI am delighted that Minister Mallon has made Castlewellan an early priority. There will be somedisruption for the next few weeks as work gets underway but the Department has provided assurances that this will be managed as much as possible so that people can get where they need to go.Roads officials say that completion of the work in Castlewellan by May  will depend on the progress of the scheme and favourable weather conditions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Supermarkets.jpg","title":"Supermarkets deal with unprecedented demand  ","story":"AMID unprecedented scenes of shopping hysteria throughout the district supermarkets have been struggling to keep stock of basic supplies.A member of staff in one major store said it was ldquolike Christmas all over again.One supermarket staff member said he had filled the shelves to capacity with toilet rolls three times by lunchtime.He said that he had been working in the store for almost  years and he had never witnessedessential supplies such as hand wipes, milk and tin foods fly off the shelves so fast.Another staff member said he was worried about the back stock running low because when that was gone, a more dficult situation could arise.Shopper Christine Toland said she is not panicking but remains worried that supermarkets may run out of essentials supplies.The Downpatrick mother said: ldquoMy mother and father in-law hope to fly over from Manchester this weekend for a visit and are worried they might come in contact with the virus.ldquoIrsquom very concerned that we may not have enough essential items for the duration of their stay.Christine added that both herself and her eight year-old daughter Cha are asthmatic andare worried this will only weaken their immune system.Meanwhile, a Downpatrick nurse said she is refusing to give into the widespread hysteria to buy more than she needs.Karen OrsquoReilly said: ldquoMy father is unable to get out so Irsquom picking up some things for him.

It is evident that the church has little or no interest in the public worship of God. What God has commanded is now seen as mere lip service. The Headship of Christ is now openly denied.Letter to the editor : Johnston Press Resell \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...What is equally troubling is that these buildings were erected for the preaching of the gospel. That is now publicly denied.In addition, the planned closure for months indicates the church is effectively irrelevant even to its members and adherents. More troubling are those who within the church are demanding the closures thereby demonstrating that the vast majority of worshippers are unconverted. Equally troubling is the future.If the church has collapsed on this issue, then it will be no surprise that it will equally collapse under persecution.God has tested the public professing church of Christ and it has been found wanting. Exposed as nothing more than pop-Christianity. Also exposed is the  message of healing. All such services have been cancelled to avoid close contact! How pathetic. Rather than close, there should be a dozen services in every building. When I see the elderly who came through a letime of storms bemused at all the snowflakes whose theology is incapable of getting them to church, it is little wonder the buildings are closed. Without a shot being fired or anyone burned at the stake, Christians in general have run away. The backbone of the Puritans and the Covenanters, of Knox and Calvin, does not exist in the Church today. They have all become marshmallows.The church has been judged. It has failed.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We donrsquot feel safe.Mr Hancock also said construction workers could continue to go to work as long as they could remain two metres apart at all times.But a spokeswoman for the mayor said the Government needed to provide ldquoproper financial support to freelancers and the self-employed.She added: ldquoThe Government must act urgently to get more people staying at home rather than going to work unnecessarily ndash that means taking the dficult decisions they are refusing to take to ban non-essential construction work and provide proper financial support to freelancers, the self-employed and those on zero-hours contracts to stay at home. vw,vw,px, px\"London Mayor Sadiq Khan in Downing Street The union Unite said construction workers were facing the choice of risking their health or losing their job.The -year-old worker who spoke to PA said large companies were deliberately ignoring the advice from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to cease all ldquonon-essential construction work.He said the site where he works, Queen Street Station in Glasgow, is the busiest train station in Scotland, but that the work being done was not essential and was putting lives at risk.ldquoThe advice being given by ScotRail is to ldquostay home and save lives, but that does not apply to us, he said.ldquoSturgeon can talk all she wants but until she puts into practise what shersquos seen and actually make demands of these companies, we are lost in limbo between Johnson, his subordinates and then our own devolved parliament.ldquoItrsquos mental, no one knows whatrsquos going on.Assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail added: ldquoThere is an immediate public health emergency on construction sites, due to a lack of social distancing.ldquoBy construction workers being compelled to work unprotected and travel, the lack of Government safety coordination, is risking their health, the health of their families and the health of the general public.Mr Khan had previously said he told Mr Johnson ldquoforcibly at a Cobra meeting that construction workers should not be going into work.After more scenes of packed Tube trains on Tuesday morning, Mr Khan was askedconstruction workers in London should be among the travellers.He told ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain: ldquoMy view is no, and I made that point quite forcibly at yesterdayrsquos Cobra, I made that point quite clearly to the Prime Minister.ldquoAccording to the Governmentrsquos advice, the answer is yes.Builders and construction workers said they felt ldquoangry and unprotected going to work following the introduction of the stricter anti-Covid- measures.Prime Minister Boris Johnson placed the UK on lockdown on Monday evening.But Downing Street has defended its position and said that construction work should continueit can be done following Public Health England and industry guidance.The Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said that the Construction Leadership Council had issued guidance to the industry.He added: ldquoIt should continue where it can happen in a way that follows Public Health England and industry guidance.ldquoWe urge employers to use their common sense when managing live projects and ensuring that employees can follow the Government guidance and practice safe social distancing on site.Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was clear construction sites should ldquobe closed unless the building that is being worked on is essential, such as a hospital.A crane operator at a London construction site with  to  workers said: ldquoEveryone on site at the minute feels angry and unprotected. vw,vw,px, px\"The man, who asked not to be named, saidhe opted not to go in he ldquowouldnrsquot get paid or even could lose my job.He added: ldquo scary really ndash Irsquove got a family and kids at home. Irsquom in London around all these people, bringing it all back into an isolated home.Electrician Dan Dobson said the Government must provide support to self-employed workers, including about a million in the construction industry, and then shut down building sites.He added: ldquoThey have no incentive to stay at home, they have bills to pay.ldquoEveryone on site at the minute feels angry and unprotected.ldquoNone of them want to go to work, everyone is worried about taking ithome to their families. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoBut they still have bills to pay, they still have rent to pay, they still have to buy food.ldquoConstruction sites will stay open until the Government issues an order to close.ldquoBut the Government cannot issue the order to close until it offers support to the one million-plus construction workers ndash it has to go hand in hand.While some companies said they were closing sites down and suspending work, others said they would remain open with ldquostrict precautions in place.Transport for Londonannounced on Tuesday that work on its Crossrail sites was being temporarily suspended, but that essential maintenance of the transport network will continue.HS said it will be reviewing the majority of works on its construction sites in line with the Governmentrsquos advice on dealing with Covid-.House-builder Taylor Wimpey also said it has closed its construction sites, show homes and sale sites. vw,vw,px, px\"Construction workers at the Waterside Quarter development site in Maidenhead But earlier on Tuesday, rival Redrow said its sites remain open with ldquostrict precautions in place including enhanced levels of cleaning, additional hygiene facilities and social distancing..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Government urged to ban non-essential construction work article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Moy Park says many of these positions could be particularly suitable to those from within the hospitality industry due to an existing awareness and familiarity with food hygiene.Moy Park HR and Performance Director, Kirsty Wilkins said “There has been a noticeable increase in grocery sales as people practice social distancing and self-isolate. This has resulted in a heightened demand for chicken produce and with it, opportunities in the sector to meet this demand. We are committed to ensuring we provide nutritious food for our communities, and we are keen to support iniduals who are looking for short term employment to meet changing consumer purchasing habits.“This increase in grocery retail comes at a time when there has been a fall in demand across our sister sectors of hospitality and tourism as people’s socialising and travel plans are curtailed. We hope the pressure being faced across these industries is short term and, in the meantime, we are keen to help anyone looking for a job through these new opportunities.” Kirsty added: “The health and wellbeing of our team is our most important consideration and we are following all relevant government advice and protocols.
