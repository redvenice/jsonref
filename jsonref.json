Despite seeming in good spirits that day, it seems yesterday’s event, marking 200 years of the Order of St Michael and St George, was a step too far for the Queen.The Queen on the final day of Royal Ascot on Saturday June 23rd (left) and shaking hands with Susan Sarandon at the Guards Polo Club Sunday June 24th          With Harry and Meghan on Tuesday June 26th at the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders reception at Buckingham Palace She was represented at the morning service by the Duke of Kent, the Grand Master of the Order.However, it was Hollywood royalty that stole the limelight, with Angelina Jolie among the attendees. The actress, 43, was invited to the service as a recipient of an honorary damehood from the order, which recognises service in relation to foreign or Commonwealth affairs.Miss Jolie, 43, wore an elegant ivory cowl-neck gown by Ralph \u0026amp Russo, a favourite designer of the Duchess of Sussex, with matching hat, handbag and gloves.Yesterday marked an unusual absence for the Queen, who is known for her strong constitution and no-fuss approach to her infrequent illnesses. Last month she had eye surgery to remove a cataract, but she was treated as a day patient and did not cancel any appearances.

Rackstraw  Investigators dedicated to uncovering the true identity of infamous 1971 airplane hijacker DB Cooper (left in police sketch) claim they now have the final pieces of evidence that proves he is Vietnam veteran Robert W. Rackstraw (right) The confession letter was obtained by television and film producer Tom Colbert after he successfully sued the FBI for the DB Cooper files.He has led a team of 40 private investigators in the hunt for the real identity behind the mastermind.  The newly uncovered letter reads:  \u0027This letter is too (sic) let you know I am not dead but really alive and just back from the Bahamas, so your silly troopers up there can stop looking for me.

He said, \u0027\u0027Tom, you\u0027re not going to believe it, but his confession is in here,\u0027\u0027\u0027 Colbert said.Sherwood identified four phrases that were used multiple times – \u0027D.B.

He added that the SWS stood for Special Warfare School, which is where the veteran supposedly learned coding Rackstraw has been on the team\u0027s radar for quite some time. Colbert had revealed in early January that a code-breaker working for him had noticed a secret coded message in a court-released letter supposedly sent by Cooper.He said at the time that a nine digit number typed at the bottom of the letter could have only come from Rackstraw because it referred to three covert military units he had ties to during the war.Colbert revealed in February that his code-breaker had since uncovered the new hidden messages in four other taunting notes sent by Cooper in the late 1970s.Coding in one note, which was sent on November 30, 1971, said: \u0027IF CATCH I AM CIA… RWR\u0027.The investigators believe the \u0027RWR\u0027 in the coding is Rackstraw\u0027s initials and that it also indicated that he expected a get-out-of-jail card from the federal spy agency if he was captured.Another note contained coding that read: \u0027CAN FBI CATCH ME… SWS\u0027, which Colbert said was Rackstraw taunting agents to track him. He added that the SWS stood for Special Warfare School, which is where the veteran supposedly learned coding. Colbert said two of the letters were mailed within 30 minutes of Rackstraw\u0027s old California mountain town.          Coding in this note, which was sent on November 30, 1971, said: \u0027IF CATCH I AM CIA… RWR\u0027. Investigators believe the \u0027RWR\u0027 in the coding is Rackstraw\u0027s initials   Colbert revealed in February that his code-breaker had uncovered the new hidden messages in four other taunting notes sent by Cooper in the late 1970s, including the one above          Colbert said the letter mentioned in the article above featured coding that read \u0027NGJS\u0027, which he says stands for his National Guard Jump School training unit          Colbert revealed in  January that a code-breaker working for him had noticed a secret coded message in this letter. He said the nine digit number  at the bottom  could have only come from Rackstraw because it referred to three covert military units he had ties to during the warHe added that the recent evidence supported what he has argued for some time - that the dare-devil heist was carried out a Rackshaw, who is alive and well in California.Investigators questioned Rackstraw about the Cooper case in 1978 and eliminated him as a suspect.  When Colbert first publicly named and linked Rackstraw to the hijacking, the veteran\u0027s lawyer called the accusations \u0027the stupidest thing I ever heard\u0027. Rackstraw had an illustrious military career as a pilot in the 1st Cavalry Division - one of the first major American air assault isions.It was there that Rackstraw learned to parachute and was given two Distinguished Flying Crosses for his performance while in the air - but he was kicked out of the army after they discovered he had lied about dropping out of high school and attending two colleges.Colbert believes the military gave him all the skills he needed to pull off the extraordinary heist.The FBI revealed in July 2016 that they were closing the investigation, saying that Cooper - whose real identity has never been confirmed by authorities - died of exposure in the woods between Oregon and Washington after jumping from the plane.           A nine-digit number typed at the bottom of a letter, supposedly sent by Cooper, could only have come from one person - a maverick Vietnam veteran Rackstraw          The notorious hijacker, who is one of the 20th century\u0027s most compelling masterminds, hijacked a Boeing 727 at Seattle-Tacoma airport in 1971 and held its crew and passengers hostage with a bomb          Colbert said two forensics experts said the handwriting from the letter (right) was so similar to the writing on Cooper\u0027s boarding card (left) that it was \u0027likely\u0027 that they \u0027were written by one person.\u0027          In recent years, Rackstraw has repeatedly denied any involvement in a crime that gripped the nationSoon after, Colbert sued the FBI to obtain reams of previously undisclosed information about the case, including the letters written by Cooper.Four of the letters were already known to the public, but Colbert obtained the fifth letter in November in the latest Freedom of Information request he had submitted. Copies of the typewritten letter were sent to The Seattle Times, The New York Times, The LA Times and The Washington Post by the hijacker at the time. Colbert argues the letter, which was sent 17 days after the hijacking, proves the existence of an FBI cover-up. \u0027I knew from the start that I wouldn\u0027t be caught,\u0027 the letter started, before later saying \u0027I left no fingerprints.\u0027 The letter wasn\u0027t public knowledge beyond a few brief reports in the newspapers that played it off as a prank, according to Colbert. Colbert said he and his wife hired two forensics experts - one a past president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners and the other an ex-FBI agent - to examine the  handwritten note.The two men both said the handwriting was so similar to the writing on Cooper\u0027s boarding card that it was \u0027likely\u0027 that they \u0027were written by one person.\u0027Colbert said Rackstraw may have included the coded messages in the letters to signal to his co-conspirators that he survived the leap from a Boeing 727 after he hijacked it.            Colbert said his team found what they believed to be a parachute strap and foam padding (above) from skyer\u0027s backpack in the forest near Cooper\u0027s alleged jump location last year. They turned over the two items, along with the dig site itself, to the FBI          Copies of the typewritten letter were sent to The Seattle Times, The New York Times, The LA Times and The Washington Post by the hijacker at the timeHe believes other men, who were seen in a small plane in another airfield around the time of the hijacking, picked up Cooper after he landed and flew under the radar to drop him off safely so that he could make his getaway.Colbert is adamant the FBI was too hasty to wrap up the investigation and now says the revelation of the hidden messages, especially the links to the CIA, proves why the agency has been stonewalling.He said his team found what they believed to be a parachute strap and foam padding from skyer\u0027s backpack in the forest near Cooper\u0027s alleged jump location last year. They turned over the two items, along with the dig site itself, to the FBI.Colbert believes the FBI still hasn\u0027t taken action on any of the team\u0027s efforts despite what they provided them.           Colbert has spent several years conducting his own investigation into the mysterious crime, writing a book and producing a documentary series on it in the processHe has spent several years conducting his own investigation into the mysterious crime, writing a book and producing a documentary series on it in the process. Colbert said he has extensively investigated Rackstraw as well. In 1977, six years after the hijacking, Rackstraw was suspected of kiting checks for $75,000, but fled before arrest and went to Iran to teach the Shah\u0027s men how to fly helicopters.Meanwhile, back at home, police raided his storage units and found 14 rifles and 150lbs of dynamite. He lost his his Iran chopper job and he was brought back the USA, where he was arrested for fraud and the murder of his stepfather. Philip Rackstraw was found in the grounds of his parents\u0027 home with two bullets in his head. Rackstraw was acquitted of murder and made bail on the fraud charge. Then he faked his death, pretending to crash his plane in the ocean at Monterey Bay, California. He was found and taken in by the FBI, who believed he might be Cooper, but a lack of evidence and the sudden discovery of some of the hijack money in Washington - planted, Colbert says, by an accomplice - led to his release.Rackstraw made a plea deal and after serving a year in prison for his Stockton convictions, he moved to Riverside, California.There he taught a law course in mediation before retiring to his yacht, \u0027Poverty sucks\u0027.The hunt for DB CooperNY Daily News - We are currently unavailable in your region"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/07/4DBF7FAA00000578-5899703-image-a-23_1530252191005.jpg","title":"School SCRAPS pupils uniforms temperatures soar 90F","story":"    Pupils at the school have ditched their uniforms in favour of PE kits in what the headteacher insists is a move to encourage the best learning environment possible \u0027The weather we have experienced is extraordinarily hot and, as this is an old building, on some days it is not as cool as many modern day air-conditioned buildings,\u0027 he said.\u0027Therefore, we are doing everything we can to ensure that our pupils have the best learning environment possible.\u0027We have taken the decision to let them come to school, if they wish, in their PE kits, as long as they bring a second kit should they have PE that day, to optimise their learning.

In 1893, he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, and went on to have five sons, including Albert, who would be crowned George VI. The royal family became known as the House of Windsor in 1917 when King George V dropped the German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha amid anti-German feeling during the First World War          Princess Margaret (1930-2002) - seen above in 1950 - was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and sister to The Queen. She was born on August 21, 1930. The Princess played an active role in the Royal Family\u0027s public work, supporting The Queen. During her lifetime, she was patron or president of more than 80 organisations, including ballet companies and children\u0027s charities. She married Antony Armstrong-Jones (who later became Earl of Snowdon) in 1960 their marriage was dissolved in 1978. Two of her children with him survive her: Lord Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto          Seen here is the Queen\u0027s grandmother - Queen Mary of Teck (1867-1953), who was the consort of King George V. Born and raised in England, she was the only daughter of Prinz von Teck, a member of the royal house of Württemberg, a historical German territory. Mary was the mother of kings Edward VIII (later Duke of Windsor he abdicated to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson) and George VI          HRH Princess Mary (1897-1965) is seen here, on piano in 1915.  The only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary, she was born at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate. She was the third of the six children of her parents, who were the Duke and Duchess of York at the time of her birth          HRH Prince Henry (1900-1974), son of King George V, is seen here in 1924. The third son of George V and Queen Mary, he was created Duke of Gloucester in 1928. In 1921, he joined the 10th Royal Hussars. During the Second World War, he served as Chief Liaison Officer between the British and French armies in Europe and (from 1941) as second in command of the 20th Armoured Brigade. He married Princess Alice in 1935 and went on to have two sons, Princes William and Richard          The Queen and Prince Philip with baby Anne in 1950. Princess Elizabeth and Philip first met when they attended the wedding of his cousin, Princess Marina of Greece to The Duke of Kent, who was an uncle of Elizabeth, in 1934. Their engagement was announced on July 9, 1947 and the couple were married in Westminster Abbey on November 20 the same year. Prince Charles, now The Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the throne, was born in 1948, and his sister, Princess Anne, now The Princess Royal, two years later. Their third child, Prince Andrew, arrived in 1960 and the fourth, Prince Edward, in 1964The original black and white photographs were painstakingly colourised by housewife Nicola Branson, 47, from Wellingborough, Norhtamptonshire. \u0027I decided to look at the Royals for colouring as a private project originally that I was going to share on my Instagram account. But a few close friends who have seen me working on these photos suggested they were amazed how they looked more like a colour photo rather than a coloured photo,\u0027 she said.Celebrated royal photographer who took portraits of the...Prince of profligacy: Charles runs up £1MILLION bill jetting...Prince Harry leads surge in men growing beards as Britons...Share this article\u0027The Royals through their generations have all been very photogenic and my personal favourite is the Queen Mother. My dad, a few months before he died, said to me, What\u0027s the point of having all these photos when now you can keep them on your phone or PC?.\u0027My response was that they are all memories - and memories can live forever. Through today\u0027s technology, old photos can be restored and colour added - those people can have pride of place in a photo frame.\u0027The royal family became known as the House of Windsor in 1917 when the Queen’s grandfather King George V dropped the German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha amid anti-German feeling during the First World War.     Mary of Teck, pictured in 1889. At the time, she was known as Princess Victoria Mary. In the run-up to the birth of William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s second child, Charlotte, in 2015, there was intense speculation among bookmakers that she was also going to be called Mary          HRH King Edward VII (1841-1910), above in 1902. The future Edward VII was born on November 9, 1841, at Buckingham Palace. He was the first-born son and second child of Queen Victoria and her consort, Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. During his mother\u0027s reign, he undertook public duties but was excluded by his mother from acting as her deputy until 1898. His high society lifestyle as Prince of Wales caused her considerable misgiving. Edward was 59 when he became king, having been heir apparent for longer than anyone else previously in British history. In 1863, he married Alexandra of Denmark. They had six children, including George V          Princess Mary (1897-1965) and son George Henry, in 1923. Mary was born during the reign of her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria          Princess Margaret Rose with the Queen Mother. Margaret was born on August 21, 1930. The Princess was educated at home with her sister Princess Elizabeth (now The Queen). She learned to ride, enjoyed swimming and became a keen gardener. By the age of four, she had piano lessons and would go on to become an accomplished pianistMs Branson, who used Adobe Photoshop to restore and instil colour into the photos, explained how she became interested in the quirky hobby. \u0027I started restoring and colourising old photos by my interest in genealogy,\u0027 she said.\u0027When my dad died, I started looking at the old photos that had been passed down from my grandparents. \u0027I was intrigued by how they would look in colour after being hidden away in a suitcase. After all, life was never in black and white.\u0027It helps to have an exceptional eye for detail, as the detail required to bring them back to life all makes the effect. \u0027Many layers of different colours and tones are added to the black and white photo.\u0027Over the time I have restored and coloured photos, I love the joy it brings to other people, seeing their faces light up with amazement when they see their ancestor in colour.\u0027          HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, above in 1950. After a successful naval career during which he saw active service in the Second World War, Philip began to focus on his work in support of The Queen following her Accession in 1952. In 2009, he became the longest-serving British consort (companion to the Sovereign), a distinction previously held by Queen Charlotte, George III’s consort. His Royal Highness also has many interests which he pursues separately to his work with Her Majesty, including conservation, engineering, and The Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s Award which he founded in 1956.

What we found was a diary containing a daily list tracking all of her symptoms, as it came closer to the day of her death, the writing evidently became more erratic.\u0027An examination of her phone also showed a number of searches regarding the question how much Mirtazapine will kill you, a drug used to treat depression.\u0027Shortly before her suicide Mrs Chapman had made a call to her sister, who reported nothing strange about the call at the time. However, it was very shortly after this conversation that she took her own life.Recording a conclusion of suicide and reading from the medical report Mr Sullivan said: \u0027Evidently she had begun to struggle under the weight of her many worsening physical and mental issues and, as a result, she saw fit to take her own life in a moment of impulsiveness.\u0027Mrs Chapman, had been involved in the borough council since 2007 having moved to Bovingdon, Hertforshire, with her husband Barrie in 1994 when he retired from a medical career in the Army. He died in 1997.She was the representative of Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield on Dacorum Borough Council before becoming civic head of the community.

They have three grown-up daughters. Lesley says:Since buying our five-metre bell tent three months ago, it’s been the star attraction in the garden of our detached home overlooking the River Trent.We enjoy throwing parties and the bell tent is an extension of our social life. We’ve fallen in love with it!Cone-shaped with a supporting pole, it is made from waterproof cotton canvas.It cost £600 from local business Bell Tent Boutique and is worth every penny. The distinctive shape makes it pretty to look at, and I wanted it to be a beautiful and luxurious haven inside. So, I’ve had a ball choosing cushions, throws, rugs and low Indian-style wooden tables.Ahead of Wimbledon I’ve stocked up on strawberries and champagne, which I intend to devour with my friends in the tent while our husbands watch the World Cup in the house.When my girlfriends visit, we’ll be found, as the sun goes down, lounging with a glass of Prosecco, putting the world to rights. The perfect place for a perfect evening.

She lives in London.I’ve had lots of bell tents, but this Luna version from boutiquecamping.com is my favourite.It’s five metres in diameter and so spacious inside I can stand up and walk around.And it’s a doddle to put up, which means I can take it to any festival in the UK or abroad, as well as friends’ festival-style weddings.I simply lay the tent out on the ground and attach the guy ropes, then once the central pole’s in position it’s easy to put the ropes and pegs into place.Ten minutes is all it takes, but I’ll happily spend a few hours accessorising. My house is full of the accessories I’ve picked up. I love to plan different themes depending on the occasion and the season.  Becka Cutler, 32, redecorates her bell tent depending on the occasion and takes it away with her if she goes camping I once pitched my previous bell tent on the beach in Ibiza with friends, having taken it on the plane as extra baggage. On the beach, I decorated it with a Scandinavian theme, with faux Reindeer hides, plus furry cushions and throws.With this incredible heatwave, I couldn’t resist buying a load of new accessories with a tropical feel, including potted palm trees, cool rugs and botanical printed cushions. I’ve also got my eye on some ornamental flamingos.Overnight, I want a great night’s sleep and a little luxury! So, I basically build a bedroom in my bell tent with a blow-up double bed, cosy pillows and throws, low tables to put lanterns on and fairy lights, too.I love to invite my girlfriends to the tent when it’s pitched in my garden, and we’ll just kick back with some girly cocktails and nibbles or a barbecue.          The inside of Becka\u0027s tent is stylish and filled with accessories. She also takes it to the beach          Becka puts a double bed inside the tent if she wants to take it away but fills it with decorations at home  It\u0027s perfect for my hen party...             Helen\u0027s family are farmers and have 1500 acres.

She says:My giant teepee is two linked ‘big hat-style teepees’ (models with brims that can be attached to other tents). From Country Tipis, it fits 200 people standing or 140 seated.Tonight I’m having 50 friends over for my hen party ahead of my wedding in September. Mum has organised it and is keeping the finer details secret, but I’ve gleaned that the teepee will be decorated with fresh flowers and balloon displays, with a Prosecco bar as the centrepiece.Sam and I will also be using it for our wedding reception, with a barbecue, cocktail bar and DJ.It’s atmospheric with smaller groups,, too, which is why I love to invite friends over to hang out there with us on Sunday afternoons in this glorious weather.          Helen Wood from Newton Longville, Buckinghamshire has a spectacular double big hat teepee.

She says:On Sunday afternoons, with a book, I love sneaking over to my 7.5m bell tent — the largest UK version available — for a snooze.The tent is pitched in our seven-acre apple orchard, where I have three smaller ones, and it is my oasis of calm. I paid £800 for it from Bell Tent Boutique and it’s so vast you can wander around. It accommodates several double beds.Recently, the tent was the venue for my cousin’s 13th birthday sleepover party with 12 of her giggling girlfriends.When I looked into buying a tent I found bell tents are the new thing, so I bought four. It means friends can sleep over in comfort and I can also rent them out to ‘glampers’.Each one has a chandelier suspended from the roof with LED tealights — you can’t have naked flames in a tent — and they are bedecked with bunting.Last month I had friends over from Australia and we had a wonderful time camping beneath the trees and laughing about old times. I love to lead friends through the trees to my gigantic tent because the general reaction is: ‘Wow!’It really is a magical spot.

He added that the SWS stood for Special Warfare School, which is where the veteran supposedly learned coding Rackstraw has been on the team\u0027s radar for quite some time. Colbert had revealed in early January that a code-breaker working for him had noticed a secret coded message in a court-released letter supposedly sent by Cooper.He said at the time that a nine digit number typed at the bottom of the letter could have only come from Rackstraw because it referred to three covert military units he had ties to during the war.Colbert revealed in February that his code-breaker had since uncovered the new hidden messages in four other taunting notes sent by Cooper in the late 1970s.Coding in one note, which was sent on November 30, 1971, said: \u0027IF CATCH I AM CIA… RWR\u0027.The investigators believe the \u0027RWR\u0027 in the coding is Rackstraw\u0027s initials and that it also indicated that he expected a get-out-of-jail card from the federal spy agency if he was captured.Another note contained coding that read: \u0027CAN FBI CATCH ME… SWS\u0027, which Colbert said was Rackstraw taunting agents to track him.

Coding in this note, which was sent on November 30, 1971, said: \u0027IF CATCH I AM CIA… RWR\u0027. Investigators believe the \u0027RWR\u0027 in the coding is Rackstraw\u0027s initials   Colbert revealed in February that his code-breaker had uncovered the new hidden messages in four other taunting notes sent by Cooper in the late 1970s, including the one above          Colbert said the letter mentioned in the article above featured coding that read \u0027NGJS\u0027, which he says stands for his National Guard Jump School training unit          Colbert revealed in  January that a code-breaker working for him had noticed a secret coded message in this letter. He said the nine digit number  at the bottom  could have only come from Rackstraw because it referred to three covert military units he had ties to during the warHe added that the recent evidence supported what he has argued for some time - that the dare-devil heist was carried out a Rackshaw, who is alive and well in California.Investigators questioned Rackstraw about the Cooper case in 1978 and eliminated him as a suspect.  When Colbert first publicly named and linked Rackstraw to the hijacking, the veteran\u0027s lawyer called the accusations \u0027the stupidest thing I ever heard\u0027. Rackstraw had an illustrious military career as a pilot in the 1st Cavalry Division - one of the first major American air assault isions.It was there that Rackstraw learned to parachute and was given two Distinguished Flying Crosses for his performance while in the air - but he was kicked out of the army after they discovered he had lied about dropping out of high school and attending two colleges.Colbert believes the military gave him all the skills he needed to pull off the extraordinary heist.The FBI revealed in July 2016 that they were closing the investigation, saying that Cooper - whose real identity has never been confirmed by authorities - died of exposure in the woods between Oregon and Washington after jumping from the plane.           A nine-digit number typed at the bottom of a letter, supposedly sent by Cooper, could only have come from one person - a maverick Vietnam veteran Rackstraw          The notorious hijacker, who is one of the 20th century\u0027s most compelling masterminds, hijacked a Boeing 727 at Seattle-Tacoma airport in 1971 and held its crew and passengers hostage with a bomb          Colbert said two forensics experts said the handwriting from the letter (right) was so similar to the writing on Cooper\u0027s boarding card (left) that it was \u0027likely\u0027 that they \u0027were written by one person.\u0027          In recent years, Rackstraw has repeatedly denied any involvement in a crime that gripped the nationSoon after, Colbert sued the FBI to obtain reams of previously undisclosed information about the case, including the letters written by Cooper.Four of the letters were already known to the public, but Colbert obtained the fifth letter in November in the latest Freedom of Information request he had submitted. Copies of the typewritten letter were sent to The Seattle Times, The New York Times, The LA Times and The Washington Post by the hijacker at the time. Colbert argues the letter, which was sent 17 days after the hijacking, proves the existence of an FBI cover-up. \u0027I knew from the start that I wouldn\u0027t be caught,\u0027 the letter started, before later saying \u0027I left no fingerprints.\u0027 The letter wasn\u0027t public knowledge beyond a few brief reports in the newspapers that played it off as a prank, according to Colbert. Colbert said he and his wife hired two forensics experts - one a past president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners and the other an ex-FBI agent - to examine the  handwritten note.The two men both said the handwriting was so similar to the writing on Cooper\u0027s boarding card that it was \u0027likely\u0027 that they \u0027were written by one person.\u0027Colbert said Rackstraw may have included the coded messages in the letters to signal to his co-conspirators that he survived the leap from a Boeing 727 after he hijacked it.            Colbert said his team found what they believed to be a parachute strap and foam padding (above) from skyer\u0027s backpack in the forest near Cooper\u0027s alleged jump location last year. They turned over the two items, along with the dig site itself, to the FBI          Copies of the typewritten letter were sent to The Seattle Times, The New York Times, The LA Times and The Washington Post by the hijacker at the timeHe believes other men, who were seen in a small plane in another airfield around the time of the hijacking, picked up Cooper after he landed and flew under the radar to drop him off safely so that he could make his getaway.Colbert is adamant the FBI was too hasty to wrap up the investigation and now says the revelation of the hidden messages, especially the links to the CIA, proves why the agency has been stonewalling.He said his team found what they believed to be a parachute strap and foam padding from skyer\u0027s backpack in the forest near Cooper\u0027s alleged jump location last year. They turned over the two items, along with the dig site itself, to the FBI.Colbert believes the FBI still hasn\u0027t taken action on any of the team\u0027s efforts despite what they provided them.           Colbert has spent several years conducting his own investigation into the mysterious crime, writing a book and producing a documentary series on it in the processHe has spent several years conducting his own investigation into the mysterious crime, writing a book and producing a documentary series on it in the process. Colbert said he has extensively investigated Rackstraw as well. In 1977, six years after the hijacking, Rackstraw was suspected of kiting checks for $75,000, but fled before arrest and went to Iran to teach the Shah\u0027s men how to fly helicopters.Meanwhile, back at home, police raided his storage units and found 14 rifles and 150lbs of dynamite. He lost his his Iran chopper job and he was brought back the USA, where he was arrested for fraud and the murder of his stepfather. Philip Rackstraw was found in the grounds of his parents\u0027 home with two bullets in his head. Rackstraw was acquitted of murder and made bail on the fraud charge. Then he faked his death, pretending to crash his plane in the ocean at Monterey Bay, California. He was found and taken in by the FBI, who believed he might be Cooper, but a lack of evidence and the sudden discovery of some of the hijack money in Washington - planted, Colbert says, by an accomplice - led to his release.Rackstraw made a plea deal and after serving a year in prison for his Stockton convictions, he moved to Riverside, California.There he taught a law course in mediation before retiring to his yacht, \u0027Poverty sucks\u0027.The hunt for DB CooperNY Daily News - We are currently unavailable in your region"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/07/4DBF910E00000578-5899703-image-m-27_1530252270038.jpg","title":"Moscow columnist accuses young Russian women acting like wh foreign World Cup fans","story":"    Platon Besedin wrote in Moskovsky Komsomolets: \u0027Social networks are overloaded with videos where young and not quite young Russian women are behaving like overused prostitutes with low social responsibility\u0027.

Among them is Elizabeth the Queen Mother (1900-202), seen above in the 1920s. She was born the Honourable Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon on August 4, 1900. She spent her early childhood at St Paul\u0027s Waldenbury in Hertfordshire. When her father inherited his Earldom in 1904, she became Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon          Elizabeth the Queen Mother, in 1920. On April 26, 1923, she married HRH The Duke of York (Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George), The King and Queen\u0027s second son, in Westminster Abbey. They had two children - Princess Elizabeth (the current Queen) and Princess Margaret          This striking colourised shot from 1911 shows George V (1865-1936), the Queen\u0027s grandfather. The second son of Edward VII - and grandson of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert - he reigned from 1910 to 1936. He was born into the the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In 1893, he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, and went on to have five sons, including Albert, who would be crowned George VI. The royal family became known as the House of Windsor in 1917 when King George V dropped the German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha amid anti-German feeling during the First World War          Princess Margaret (1930-2002) - seen above in 1950 - was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and sister to The Queen. She was born on August 21, 1930. The Princess played an active role in the Royal Family\u0027s public work, supporting The Queen. During her lifetime, she was patron or president of more than 80 organisations, including ballet companies and children\u0027s charities. She married Antony Armstrong-Jones (who later became Earl of Snowdon) in 1960 their marriage was dissolved in 1978. Two of her children with him survive her: Lord Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto          Seen here is the Queen\u0027s grandmother - Queen Mary of Teck (1867-1953), who was the consort of King George V. Born and raised in England, she was the only daughter of Prinz von Teck, a member of the royal house of Württemberg, a historical German territory. Mary was the mother of kings Edward VIII (later Duke of Windsor he abdicated to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson) and George VI          HRH Princess Mary (1897-1965) is seen here, on piano in 1915.  The only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary, she was born at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate. She was the third of the six children of her parents, who were the Duke and Duchess of York at the time of her birth          HRH Prince Henry (1900-1974), son of King George V, is seen here in 1924. The third son of George V and Queen Mary, he was created Duke of Gloucester in 1928. In 1921, he joined the 10th Royal Hussars. During the Second World War, he served as Chief Liaison Officer between the British and French armies in Europe and (from 1941) as second in command of the 20th Armoured Brigade. He married Princess Alice in 1935 and went on to have two sons, Princes William and Richard          The Queen and Prince Philip with baby Anne in 1950. Princess Elizabeth and Philip first met when they attended the wedding of his cousin, Princess Marina of Greece to The Duke of Kent, who was an uncle of Elizabeth, in 1934. Their engagement was announced on July 9, 1947 and the couple were married in Westminster Abbey on November 20 the same year. Prince Charles, now The Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the throne, was born in 1948, and his sister, Princess Anne, now The Princess Royal, two years later. Their third child, Prince Andrew, arrived in 1960 and the fourth, Prince Edward, in 1964The original black and white photographs were painstakingly colourised by housewife Nicola Branson, 47, from Wellingborough, Norhtamptonshire. \u0027I decided to look at the Royals for colouring as a private project originally that I was going to share on my Instagram account. But a few close friends who have seen me working on these photos suggested they were amazed how they looked more like a colour photo rather than a coloured photo,\u0027 she said.Celebrated royal photographer who took portraits of the...Prince of profligacy: Charles runs up £1MILLION bill jetting...Prince Harry leads surge in men growing beards as Britons...Share this article\u0027The Royals through their generations have all been very photogenic and my personal favourite is the Queen Mother. My dad, a few months before he died, said to me, What\u0027s the point of having all these photos when now you can keep them on your phone or PC?.\u0027My response was that they are all memories - and memories can live forever. Through today\u0027s technology, old photos can be restored and colour added - those people can have pride of place in a photo frame.\u0027The royal family became known as the House of Windsor in 1917 when the Queen’s grandfather King George V dropped the German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha amid anti-German feeling during the First World War.     Mary of Teck, pictured in 1889. At the time, she was known as Princess Victoria Mary. In the run-up to the birth of William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s second child, Charlotte, in 2015, there was intense speculation among bookmakers that she was also going to be called Mary          HRH King Edward VII (1841-1910), above in 1902. The future Edward VII was born on November 9, 1841, at Buckingham Palace. He was the first-born son and second child of Queen Victoria and her consort, Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. During his mother\u0027s reign, he undertook public duties but was excluded by his mother from acting as her deputy until 1898. His high society lifestyle as Prince of Wales caused her considerable misgiving. Edward was 59 when he became king, having been heir apparent for longer than anyone else previously in British history. In 1863, he married Alexandra of Denmark. They had six children, including George V          Princess Mary (1897-1965) and son George Henry, in 1923. Mary was born during the reign of her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria          Princess Margaret Rose with the Queen Mother. Margaret was born on August 21, 1930. The Princess was educated at home with her sister Princess Elizabeth (now The Queen). She learned to ride, enjoyed swimming and became a keen gardener. By the age of four, she had piano lessons and would go on to become an accomplished pianistMs Branson, who used Adobe Photoshop to restore and instil colour into the photos, explained how she became interested in the quirky hobby. \u0027I started restoring and colourising old photos by my interest in genealogy,\u0027 she said.\u0027When my dad died, I started looking at the old photos that had been passed down from my grandparents. \u0027I was intrigued by how they would look in colour after being hidden away in a suitcase. After all, life was never in black and white.\u0027It helps to have an exceptional eye for detail, as the detail required to bring them back to life all makes the effect. \u0027Many layers of different colours and tones are added to the black and white photo.\u0027Over the time I have restored and coloured photos, I love the joy it brings to other people, seeing their faces light up with amazement when they see their ancestor in colour.\u0027          HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, above in 1950. After a successful naval career during which he saw active service in the Second World War, Philip began to focus on his work in support of The Queen following her Accession in 1952. In 2009, he became the longest-serving British consort (companion to the Sovereign), a distinction previously held by Queen Charlotte, George III’s consort. His Royal Highness also has many interests which he pursues separately to his work with Her Majesty, including conservation, engineering, and The Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s Award which he founded in 1956.

Rising from a series of limestone terraces above a scrubby valley of olive trees, this metallic box is the new $21m (£15.95m) home for the AM Qattan Foundation, an arts centre that its founders hope will stand as a “beacon of culture” in the occupied West Bank.“It is more than just an arts centre,” says Omar Al-Qattan, the Beirut-born, British-educated chairman of the foundation. “We hope it might be a modest microcosm of urban public life, something that Palestinian cities lack.”It is no small ambition, but then the Qattan Foundation has always dreamed big. Founded in 1993 by Omar’s father, Abdel Mohsin Al-Qattan, a Palestinian refugee who made a fortune in the Gulf construction industry, it now employs more than 100 people in the West Bank and Gaza, running educational outreach programmes and public activities with a focus on science, drama and the arts. Its efforts have always been dispersed across numerous sites, and Al-Qattan’s dying wish was to see everything brought together in one place, with a gallery, library, theatre, artists’ residencies and studios for dance and art, along with one of the first public plazas in the city.Look at a map of Ramallah and you will see several intersections deceptively marked as “squares”, which turn out to be traffic-choked roundabouts. Visitors to the new complex will enjoy the rare treat of standing on a car-free limestone plaza, where fountains will soon spurt, with a cafe and views of the rolling valley beyond, all shielded from the street by a long, perforated stone wall. The building’s multilevel terraces teemed with excited families at the public opening on 28 June, when more than 1,500 people showed up to explore the facilities.It is the work of Seville-based Donaire Arquitectos, who were chosen following an invited competition of small, young practices. They have brought a refined Andalusian sensibility to the arid site. “We are Spanish, so we had to bring a plaza and a bar,” jokes Juan Pedro Donaire, who relocated his team here for the last three years to supervise the work closely. “It has been years of fighting to achieve anything close to the standards we wanted. There are defects, but it is the best we could do while building under (Israeli) occupation.”They struggled with the lack of a skilled workforce – he says the best builders work across the border, where Israeli firms pay double or triple local wages – and endured endless delays, with imported materials held up by Israeli customs. The library shelves were mysteriously detained for three months, while a container of light fixtures a sheet of bulletproof glass needed for the gallery space to be able accept precious loans have yet to arrive.“We are used to the daily harassment,” says Al-Qattan, who received permission last year to visit his foundation’s Gaza children’s centre, after waiting for a decade, “but this is an absurd abuse of power.”Considering the constraints, the architects have pulled off an impressive feat and achieved a rare level of precision. There are some bodged details, but the result is far superior to most buildings in ramshackle towns of the West Bank.Greeting the street with a long, stone wall, it has the air of a corporate compound from the outside, and there is a defensive, citadel quality to its imposing presence on the hill. Once inside, you arrive in an oasis of calm. A shallow ramp leads you down past sunken gardens to the main gallery space (the largest in the city at 410 sq m) and down again to a small theatre, lined with Weetabix-like acoustic panels, and spaces for dance and painting, all of which open out on to a terrace looking over the valley. The perforated metal cube of the library and foundation offices emerges from this limestone plinth of cultural functions, standing as a glass box clothed with a pleated skin of louvres, giving a silvery corduroy finish. Glinting in the sun, it is alien enough to stand out, while doing so with modesty. As Donaire puts it: “We cannot be Zaha Hadid here. We had to be vernacular, but at the same time offer a surprise and bring something of international quality.”The shimmering continues inside, where a wall of aluminium, perforated with a traditional textile pattern, lines the oak-floored atrium. It is an airy space, flooded with light from circular openings in the roof, in a nod to Finnish architect Alvar Aalto’s Viipuri library. The two-floor library, teaching spaces and offices above offer spectacular views, while fresh air flows across the floors, helping to earn the building silver award Palestinian Higher Green Building Council – the second such project to be certified, following the Palestinian Museum last year. It couldn’t get a higher award, the architects say, because the required services simply aren’t in place. Great piles of construction waste spill down the hillside, awaiting collection.The fraught context is highlighted in the building’s opening exhibition, Subcontracted Nations. Once again struggling with what could be imported, the show nonetheless brings together an impressive range of politically charged work, from Bisan Abu-Eisheh’s speculative designs for Palestinian banknotes, to Alexandra Sophia Handal’s study of how expropriated Palestinian houses in West Jerusalem are repackaged for the Israeli market as “Arab style”. It is self-critical, too: anyone who has dealt with Middle Eastern bureaucracy will sympathise with the message behind Notarised by Majdi Hadid, a gigantic rubber stamp bearing the emblem of the Palestinian National Authority that greets visitors at the entrance.It is an ominous presence, and a reminder of the precarious situation. When you are waiting by the trash heap for a taxi, it is easy to question the viability of this gleaming new facility in a suburb not served by public transport. Al-Qattan says the foundation is in talks with the municipality about introducing a shared taxi route, or its own shuttle service, and he is optimistic it will soon feel more connected, given the rate of Ramallah’s growth.“But it is part of a much wider problem,” he says. “The events of 1948, when Palestinians were expelled from Jaffa, Jerusalem, Haifa, Acre, Tiberias, had a profound impact on the society’s relationship to the built environment. Because of the squeeze of the occupation, places like Ramallah were subject to this crazy wave of totally artificial immigration. There’s a kind of resentment and anger reflected in how they build and organise themselves. There is a temporariness to everything, informed by growing up in refugee camps.”He says the next big challenge is to think in a new way about Palestinian urban life and rebuild it properly, something that this new complex hopes to point towards. “We want this to be a place where strangers can meet, where ideas can be exchanged, where you can just come and be anonymous. A public space in every sense of the word.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/237263e696dea0a943f6f4c271071fb0cadcff67/0_0_3264_4928/master/3264.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=568ac456eecbfeb95ae0f9bf0cf97d2f 1760w","title":"emil gayed self described nurturing obstetrician who mutilated women","story":"Disgraced doctor is subject of two separate inquiries into his treatment of women ning five public hospitalsIn an online profile on a health website, Emil Shawky Gayed describes himself a “calm” and “sensitive” obstetrician and gynaecologist who has “practised medicine for many years”.“I have always managed to implement all the changes required to be able to provide the best quality care as possible... my approach is sympathetic, warm, and nurturing,” the profile says.Dozens of his former patients have a starkly different opinion. They describe him as someone who was rude and irate when questioned, and who dismissed or made light of their complaints of being in severe distress and pain. He has been found guilty by the New South Wales civil and administrative tribunal of professional misconduct for failing to adequately inform patients before performing surgery on them, and of needlessly performing surgeries such as hysterectomy and fallopian tube removal on women who could have been treated with painkillers and bed-rest. One of his patients died.But some of the hospitals where Gayed worked have no record of his employment. This is alarming given Gayed is now the subject of two separate inquiries investigating his treatment of women ning five public hospitals.What is known about Gayed is that he graduated from Egypt’s Ain Shams public university in 1976. The University’s faculty of medicine is one of the most highly-regarded medical training faculties in Egypt. A ledger of graduates held at the faculty’s registrar’s office shows Gayed obtained the second-lowest grade of ‘good’ out of a range of four grades ranging from ‘pass’ to ‘excellent’. Records held by the Egyptian medical syndicate show Gayed registered as a doctor in 1977. Egyptian doctors seeking to work abroad sometimes require a certificate of good standing from the medical syndicate and permission from the ministry of health, depending on the requirements of their workplace. No record of such a letter exists on Gayed’s file with the syndicate. Syndicate records show while he was licensed to practise medicine in Egypt with heavy supervision in a residency or similar program, he would have been unable to practise as a specialist or a GP without a masters degree or further specialisation, which it has no records of him obtaining.By 1982 Gayed was working overseas. Records from the General Medical Council, responsible for registering doctors to practise in the UK, shows Gayed registered there in 1982. The council has no record of where in the UK he worked or if he received further training there.By the 90s Gayed had moved to Australia where he trained to become a specialist gynaecologist and obstetrician. He graduated as a fellow of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1993. While records of the first years Gayed worked in Australia are scarce, it is clear that within several years complaints and concerns arose about his work in his chosen speciality.Gayed began working as a locum or visiting medical officer in rural and regional towns in NSW. He often consulted patients in private rooms and performed procedures on them in the public hospitals of those towns. Gayed did stints at Kempsey District hospital between 1990 and 2003, Grafton Base hospital between 1994 and 1995, Cooma hospital between 1994 and 1999, and Manning Base hospital between 1999 and 2016. He filled in for several months as an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Canberra hospital in 1996, and also did some work at Mona Vale hospital on Sydney’s northern beaches between 2002 and 2007. But the bulk of his career was spent in regional communities.An investigation was first launched into Gayed in 2000 relating to his time working in Cooma, where general practitioners and midwives who worked with him there and in Canberra expressed concerns about his dismissive and uncaring treatment of women. While the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists confirmed it was subpoenaed for information about Gayed at the time, it no longer has records of what specific information was requested, or the outcome of any investigation. The ACT health department said it could find no records of Gayed as an employee, including as a contract medical officer or a visiting medical officer. Several senior doctors spoken to by  Australia have confirmed, however, that he did work at Canberra Hospital as a locum in 1996, and that midwives especially had concerns about him. During this time, he performed ablation surgery on his own wife, which involves surgically destroying the lining of the uterus, at the John James private hospital. She was transferred to Canberra hospital’s emergency department after suffering complications.But the bulk of complaints surrounding Gayed relate to his most recent employment as a visiting medical officer at the Manning Rural Referral hospital in the small town of Taree on the mid-north coast of NSW. He consulted at his private clinic in Taree and at private rooms in Dee Why, a northern Sydney suburb 316km south. He appeared to return to his home at Collaroy Plateau, near Dee Why, on weekends, and regularly worshipped at the St Rewis Coptic Orthodox church. Although staff at the public hospital and patients had serious concerns about Gayed ning more than two decades, Gayed’s career did not start to unravel until 2015, when one of his patients made a complaint to the Health Care Complaints Commission. The complaint was made by a woman who nearly died after a procedure Gayed had performed. She mentioned to investigators that Gayed had paid for a friend of hers to get an abortion after he failed to detect she was pregnant before performing a procedure on her that would likely have harmed her unborn child.This complaint sparked a wider investigation that found seven women received inappropriate medical treatment from Gayed between 2011 and 2016, and that many of them did not give informed consent to major surgery. The investigation found he needlessly removed the uterus of a woman who could have been treated with painkillers and bed rest, and that he removed another woman’s healthy right fallopian tube. After details of their cases were published by  Australia, dozens more women came forward describing traumatic surgeries they did not want or did not need at the hands of Gayed. Some alleged they were left with serious infections and nerve damage. Manning hospital scanned Gayed’s ablation records and found ten further patients who Gayed had performed ablation on despite the presence of hyperplasia – which can be an early sign of cancer – in the uterus. Ablation should never be performed on women with hyperplasia because scarring from the procedure can mask cancer growth and trigger the development of cancerous cells. One of Gayed’s patients died after he failed to tell her that tests revealed she had hyperplasia. He performed ablation on her and did not follow- up or refer her to a cancer specialist. The hospital found Gayed had performed hundreds of ablations on women, at a far higher rate than other gynaecologists.Dr Osama Ali, the clinical director of Manning hospital who is now reviewing the cases of more than 45 women who have made further complaints to a hotline the hospital established for Gayed’s patients, said he “struggled to understand why” Gayed performed needless procedures on women.“It’s a question for him to answer, why he’s operated on all these ladies,” Ali said. “Whether it’s a matter of money, increasing his skills, recklessness, a lack of insight... I can’t tell. They’re all possibilities.” He said there was never any indication that Gayed was mentally unwell.The NSW Medical Board is now also under review for its responses to ‐ and management of ‐ historical complaints about Gayed. has tried to contact Gayed to comment on the accusations against him, but he has not returned calls. His current whereabouts is unknown.Adham Youssef contributed additional reporting from Cairo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f32fd8422bb421af9ff961b95fe23b7d122bd99/0_312_5213_3128/master/5213.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adffb573209e4822957432d4bc510389","title":"authors and publishers trade blows over plummeting author pay levels","story":"Responding to a survey that found the median author income had dropped to £10,500, Publishers Association said the figures were ‘unrecognisable’The Society of Authors has issued a sharply worded challenge to the UK’s biggest publishers after the chief executive of the Publishers Association questioned new figures revealing the plummeting incomes of writers, describing them as “unrecognisable”.But the Publishers Association’s chief executive, Stephen Lotinga, argued against blaming the trade body’s members, telling the Bookseller: “These figures will be unrecognisable to the majority of publishers as they just do not reflect the investments they are making in creative talent.”“If we are to have a genuinely constructive conversation about this issue, then we need a much sounder evidence base,” said Lotinga. “Publishers value authors enormously and their entire businesses are dependent on supporting them.”In an open letter to Lotinga, published on Friday, Solomon said that the decline in earnings revealed in the ALCS research echoed similar findings from surveys around the world. Along with ALCS chief executive Owen Atkinson, she called on publishers to state in their accounts what they pay to authors, illustrators and translators in advances, royalties and secondary income.She invited the Publishers Association to work with the society “to look at the causes of declining incomes for authors, and to ensure that profits are fairly shared along the value chain”, because “paying fairly and encouraging underrepresented voices to consider writing might just widen our reader bases enough to give everyone a bigger share of the pie”.The Publishers Association told the  it was considering a response."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7832602692bd7688af7edbf04278bcd7c6b6ec61/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91211f60a13692a33dbb693643b647e6","title":"faanga us tech giants facebook amazon apple netflix google","story":"Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google have so far dodged impact of trade war They are just five companies but they are together worth more than the huge international businesses that make up the entire FTSE 100, more than the companies that comprise Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, and more than Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac 40 put together.They are the US technology giants collectively known as Faangs – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (owned by Alphabet these days) – and their stellar stock market performances of the past few years has continued in the first six months of 2018 despite a number of serious headwinds.Technology companies in general have been buffeted by Donald Trump’s trade battles, in particular the idea of restricting Chinese investment in US companies and limit American technology exports to China. There have also been inidual difficulties – sometimes of their own making – for the top companies to confront, but their share price has continued to march on.But out of all the Faangs, the standout success this year has been Netflix. Its market value has more than doubled to $172bn – making it bigger than Disney. The company has found success with the likes of Stranger Things and Queer Eye, and has signed up Barack and Michelle Obama for their own series. It is perhaps the only one of the five which can still be described as a disruptor, rather than a fully established business.These soaring valuations mean that the top slots in the Bloomberg Billionaires list is dominated by tech entrepreneurs, with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos leading the way with a net worth of $141bn.Can the boom continue? Apart from the continuing uncertainties about Trump’s trade outbursts, there are concerns about tech companies’ current sky high valuations, which rekindle memories of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when loss-making businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing down to earth. There is also the threat of increased regulation following the well-rehearsed privacy issues.But there is a key difference to the dotcom era: these companies are profitable. In a recent note Goldman Sachs strategists Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson dismissed fears of another tech bubble, saying: “Unlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future.”Russ Mould, investment director at asset manager AJ Bell, said the five – with the possible exception of Netflix – are leaders in their fields and are making impressive profits at a time of modest economic growth, providing products and services people are willing to pay for.He added: “These companies generally have little debt, lots of cash and are thus seen as ‘safer’ than many other firms – and these funds are being used to pay out huge idends and buybacks to shareholders in the case of Apple.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722a5edd8736cfc61aa6e96549cc9a0d8f9d5e24/54_302_7189_4314/master/7189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8810b2059183f161689ee56f57169b","title":"oxford buses turn to uber style apps in on demand experiment","story":"Passengers can summon a minibus to and from any street corner in eastern half of cityMeet the new bus: not quite the same as the old bus. With echoes of the Latin American colectivo or Israeli sherut but in super-smart vehicles networked by Uber-style apps, on-demand services are popping up in cities around Britain – with the big transport companies unshackling their buses in the hope of driving cars off the roads.The biggest on-demand experiment yet launched this week in Oxford, where passengers can use an app to summon a minibus to and from any street corner in the eastern half of the city.At £2.50, the fare is a fraction of a taxi and only slightly more than the normal bus but the PickMeUp service is not limited by routes – although it will stop to pick up more passengers going the same way. With an almost identical scheme, ArrivaClick, launching in Liverpool later this summer, could on-demand bus services lure car owners onboard, cutting congestion and pollution?David Brown, the chief executive of the Go-Ahead transport group, which owns the PickMeUp operator, Oxford Bus Company, is cautiously optimistic. Speaking at Oxford’s science park, on the fringe of the city, he says: “This is classic territory where it’s tricky for a traditional bus service to deliver. But with the new technology you can identify where people are and provide for them in a way you couldn’t before.”Brown says: “If you don’t own a car, how do you get there? If it’s your first job you’re pretty stuffed. And if people can’t get to work and jobs that leads to another raft of social issues.”PickMeUp is looking to attract the well-heeled professional, too: the six low-emission Mercedes-Benz minibuses have free wifi, USB charging points and comfortable seating for 17, plus wheelchair space. There is no public subsidy but Go-Ahead has garnered support from employers in the business parks around Oxford’s periphery to encourage staff onboard, to reduce their own problems with car parking and congestion. Testing the service, the  was notified by the app on schedule, at St Aldates in the city centre, that its vehicle would be on the corner with Speedwell Street, 200 metres away, in two minutes. No other passengers were onboard but some people had already become regulars, according to the driver, Ryan Palmer. Having switched from driving double-deckers, he says. “I love it – it’s much more sociable. You get a hello on the normal buses but here you could really get to know the passengers.” Later, a bus arrived on cue at the science park, driven by Dawn, who enthuses: “I’ve been to places I never knew existed – and down some very narrow streets.”According to drivers and the firm, the service is proving popular with its 750 early adopters: for many, significantly quicker than other public transport and a lot cheaper than a taxi, with a similar level of convenience. Fares are planned to become dynamic – and potentially lower – when more people are on onboard but the current £2.50 fare will double for anyone seeking a bespoke ride along routes served by normal buses. “We don’t want to cannibalise our own service,” Brown says.The green shoots of on-demand buses come at a bleak time for many other services. Public subsidy has been squeezed, directly and indirectly, through years of government austerity: central grants to operators have been slashed, while financially stricken councils have stopped supporting routes deemed commercially unviable. Oxfordshire county council scrapped all bus subsidies in 2016, leading to the immediate disappearance of dozens of routes. Those villages are unlikely to ever provide enough demand for services such as PickMeUp to work, the company concedes. Phil Southall, the managing director of Oxford Bus Company, says: “It’s not going to solve rural bus problems overnight. But if people want to talk to us …”Data collated by requests to the app – built by the New York ride-sharing service, Via – can show where demand could potentially allow new, fixed routes to be created. Stagecoach, which gave a trial to a low-tech, landline version of on-demand buses along a linear route in Fife as far back as 2003, suggested that new technology could make them work in rural areas but would need public subsidy. It recently experimented with cab-to-bus tickets in Kent, an option First Group is developing with an app for “last-mile” shared taxi rides between homes and bus stops along a main route in Bristol. Other experiments, on linear routes, include CityMapper and Ford’s Chariot in London, and targeted, peak-hour ride-sharing schemes such as Slide in Bristol. Go-Ahead’s venture has the biggest scale and flexibility to date: almost 2,000 “virtual stops” in its app, operating from 6am to 11pm, to cover work shifts of employers such as TripAdvisor located in the science park. On-demand bus trials to date have not been unqualified successes: a scheme in Sydney, Australia, has been attacked as a scandalous waste of money after so far costing an average of A$100 (£56) per trip. However, Go-Ahead has pledged to run the service for at least a year to see if the firm’s £850,000 investment works. Brown says: “There is high travel demand and this links people for employment and social needs. If it doesn’t work here it won’t work anywhere. Then the car has won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c89b2c7e29b5e51e145ce64a0fa0d13b33341640/0_233_5610_3366/master/5610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80707f19ca385a3680e228812bb23c1a","title":"pretty peppery perfect for summer heatwave boosts uk radish sales","story":"Suppliers say Instagram-friendly looks are also behind rising demand for vegetableCould the humble radish be challenging the avocado as the trendiest food?Sales of the peppery root vegetables have soared in the past three months. Suppliers say this is the result of their Instagram-friendly looks, new ways of cooking and serving them, and the UK’s prolonged period of warm weather, which has left family cooks looking for ways to liven up salads.According to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel, which monitors food sales, 900,000 more UK households have bought radishes in the past 12 weeks.“It’s an exciting time for radishes,” he added. “I don’t think we’ve ever sold so many. It could be the new avocado.” They also look pretty on the plate. “With more choice on the market and brightly coloured, Instagram-friendly fruit and veg doing well at the moment, growth is likely to continue,” Griffiths said. “As plant-based and flexitarian diets become more visible, it’s unsurprising that consumers are widening their repertoire.“The humble radish is popular for many reasons. Two-thirds of consumers eat them because they’re healthy.” Andy Weir, at the salad grower Reynolds, where radish sales have risen by a third year-on-year, said mooli, also known as daikon or the oriental radish, was also selling well, helped by demand for fermented foods and Korean cuisine.Nina Cooper, a food trends expert at the consultancy Dragon Rouge, said: “People want more spice in their food, which is compensatory if you are not having so much sugar and fat. Cayenne pepper and wasabi have also skyrocketed and radishes could be part of that.”She said the trend for “grazing”, eating little and often, was also boosting sales, as radishes were small and easy to grab from the fridge or to eat with dip.

The definite agreement would be signed shortly, it added.The move followed a memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in September. Hiesinger had faced pressure from activist shareholders Cevian Capital and Elliott Advisors to extract more commitments from Tata Steel, whose European business performed worse than Thyssen’s since the deal was first announced in September, thus creating a valuation gap. Thyssenkrupp said that in case of an initial public offering of the joint venture, which is widely expected by investors and has been flagged by both companies, it would get a bigger share of the proceeds “reflecting an economic ratio of 55-45”. The German group also said it expected annual synergies of €400m-500m from the transaction, having previously communicated a maximum of €600m. Markus Grolms, the vice-chair of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, said Tata Steel would continue to remain liable for environmental risks in Britain, where its Port Talbot factory, the least profitable of the joint venture, is based. He said Tata’s Dutch unit would be part of the joint venture’s cash-pooling mechanism, which had been a key demand for German workers concerned that Tata would give its own workers better conditions in the new company. “Yes, we do want to protect people. But we also want a company with better chances and less risks,” Grolms said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/454fd648524d97a12aa73d302cd96d410cf437bc/1_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503ac523343049412712cbedcf6736be","title":"quiz how well do you know business jargon","story":"Want to get soaked in a thought shower?

But in Quebec, which has twice had referendums on independence, it’s when tenancies traditionally end – leading to mayhem on the streetsMontreal has a valiant knack for inconvenience. The winters are brutal, and when summer finally comes, one can safely bet that any well-attended park, shopping street or highway will become clogged with construction, as every builder in the province takes two weeks off at exactly the same time in July. The Quebecois love doing things all together, en famille – and in that spirit there is Moving Day: 1 July, when the majority of residential leases both begin and end. To call Moving Day mayhem is to prettify the truth of trucks double-parked three deep on narrow two-way streets, amateurs humping fridges up the city’s legendarily winding outdoor staircases (partly because nobody can get a professional mover – they’re all quadruple-booked), and creative Quebeckers devising all sorts of methods for relocating their stuff. On Moving Day, you will see bicycles pulling gigantic, self-made wagons, and compact cars with so much furniture bungee-corded to the roofs that homemade bumpers made of pool noodles must be employed.Prasun Lala, a technology researcher at McGill University and the École de Technologie Supérieure, argues that Montreal’s well-stocked rental market is to blame for the puzzling persistence of Moving Day.“A landlord is always looking for a year lease,” Lala says. “So if everyone is always moving at the same time, landlords have a better market and the chances of having months where an apartment is empty are less. If you find a place on an off month – say, January – most Montreal landlords will make you sign a lease that takes you to July, and then sign another one, beginning on 1 July.”Like so many aspects of Quebecois culture, including well-loved songs, recipes and turns of phrase long forgotten in France, Moving Day has its roots in the province’s colonial past. In 17th- and 18th-century Quebec, there was a fixed date – 1 May – for many legal agreements. It took until the 1970s for the Quebec government to abolish this law for housing leases, and then it moved all existing leases to 1 July because too many kids were being pulled out of school to help their parents move. Since 1973, then, Moving Day has not been law, but rather tradition – a problematic idea that refuses to peter out.It is compounded by the fact that many Montrealers move frequently – even yearly. “If you compare Montreal to a city like New York, where decent living space is such a commodity that a couple might stay together for the sake of the apartment they share, in Montreal, you have the opposite syndrome,” says Lala. “People are breaking up over and over again, because they found something more enticing down the block.”Kristian Gravenor, a local journalist, historian and author of Montreal: 375 Tales of Eating, Drinking, Living and Loving, says Moving Day has a political dimension as well: “It’s impossible not to realise that 1 July is also Canada Day.” In the rest of Canada, 1 July is popularly known as Canada’s birthday: a federal statutory holiday, formerly named Dominion Day, replete with fireworks, parades, street parties and a scary percentage of Canadians wearing red maple leaf-branded baseball caps with built-in beer can holders and umbilical drinking straws.  “Especially,” he adds, “when you also consider that Quebec has really intensely enshrined its own national holiday – La Fête Nationale, 24 June – only about a week before Canada Day.” But even with all Moving Day’s inconveniences, it’s easy to find Quebeckers who say they wouldn’t change a thing about it. “There is a very popular concept in Quebec,” says Gravenor, “described by this word s’entraider, something like neighbours helping neighbours out. People here take pride in it.”  Lala says he has helped friends on Moving Day at least a dozen times, “because they’ve all helped me more than a dozen times”. He agrees that Moving Day is a community-building activity, like barn raising. “Its feeling is of everyone being in something together.” He tells a story about trying to parallel-park his moving truck on Moving Day a few years ago. “The street was crazy with people and trucks, and I badly rear-ended my new neighbour’s car. Within an hour, her boyfriend was parking the truck for me. It makes me think of how, in Montreal, in the winter, if you see someone’s car stuck in the snow, you just go and help push them out. There’s no thinking, you just do it. This was the same. It was like, ‘It’s Moving Day. Disasters are to be expected.’”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a3a815c81c250ba0525c5a9060e41fc7d4cbc6/0_103_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de2fa72691d628eb415793321b18cddc","title":"a treat for the eye candy coloured churches of south india in pictures","story":"Between 2011 and 2016, Sabine Haubitz and Stefanie Zoche photographed churches and cinemas whose architecture is a unconventional blend of western influences and local construction styles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09924de7b342ac7f3b97e00cc3164db1a5d480e8/216_109_4262_2557/master/4262.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566698aad4c68726b73d3620aac66a5c","title":"england danny dyer brexit eu deal","story":"You can’t do a bespokered-white-and-blue EU deal. The pretend landlord of the Queen Vic has figured this out“It’s getting tickly now,” Alex Ferguson famously observed during a title run-in. “Squeaky bum time, I call it.” This was in 2003, seven years after arguably the definitive Premier League bum-squeak. More of a follow-through, in fact, as the then Newcastle manager, Kevin\u0026nbspKeegan, succumbed to his now legendary Ferguson-induced rant. “I will love it if we beat them – love\u0026nbspit!” he frothed, of Manchester United. The rest, of\u0026nbspcourse, is history.To watch Theresa May come out of this week’s EU summit with just six weeks of negotiating time left on the Brexit clock, and declare the EU was risking the lives of its citizens by not striking a security deal with her, was to experience a similar look-away moment. The prime minister is this close to jabbing her finger at the camera and declaring the EU27 have got to go to Middlesbrough and get something. Of the many roles in which May has cruelly miscast herself, that of crap blackmailer is the most excruciating.Still, what happened at the business end of things – the by now traditional bit of an EU summit where May has to leave while the other countries talk about the important stuff? Pas devant les enfants, as my grandmother used to say. In summary, they seem to have\u0026nbspcome to a tentative arrangement on migration. And the EU’s Michel Barnier appears to be broadly in agreement with the Queen Vic’s Danny Dyer.Look, without wishing to involve you in what might sarcastically be described as “my process”, I no longer remark that things are “sentences I never expected to type”. We passed the Typed Lands in 2016. Wherever this place is, this is normal. Nor does my keyboard raise so much as a ??? to report that the prime minister’s official spokesman was today formally asked if the prime minister concurred with EastEnders actor Dyer that her predecessor, David Cameron, was “a twat”. This is where we live now. Try not to choke on it.If you haven’t seen Dyer’s outburst on ITV’s Good Evening Britain, I urge you to take 36 seconds to do so. As fellow studio guests including Pamela Anderson and Jeremy Corbyn cock their heads thoughtfully, Danny begins by observing that Brexit is a riddle. “So what’s happened to that twat David Cameron, who called it on?” he wonders. The inquiry turns out to be rhetorical, as the Real Football Factories legend expands: “He’s in Europe, in Nice with his trotters up, yeah? Where is the geezer?! I\u0026nbspthink he should be held account for it. He should be held account for it.”As the producers pan out to get reaction shots from\u0026nbspstudio guests such as Harry Redknapp and the Conservative party deputy chairman, James Cleverly – like I said, this is where we live now – Dyer can be heard lobbing in a final “Twat”. Speak for England, Danny! Or rather, speak for south-east metropolitan centres, Scotland and Northern Ireland! The rest think you’re the\u0026nbsptwat, but that’s showbiz.Wherever you stand on Brexit, though, we can at least\u0026nbspthank Dyer for his hilarious addition to Westminster’s annals of quotable quotes. God knows, they can always use the material. I was reminded this week that Neil Hamilton once won the Spectator’s Parliamentary Wit of the Year – an award that certainly puts Nigel Mansell winning Sports Personality\u0026nbspof the Year twice into perspective.Danny’s latest pensée is easily as amusing as his rumination on the 11th anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center. “Can’t believe it’s been nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the twin towers,” this ran. “Still freaks my nut out to this day.”It is, however, not as amusing as the big-hitting Brexiters and four-star political commentators who have spent the hours since Dyer’s Brexit communique mobilising to condemn the reaction to it. Why are people listening to an actor, wonder various sorts who take themselves rather too seriously. I don’t know, guys – but let’s face it, they’ll probably have better luck down the bookies than if they listen to newspaper columnists.Why is his ghastly swearing being lionised, runs another line of inquiry. That I do know\u0026nbspthe answer to – it’s because it’s funny. And at this\u0026nbspstage in the Brexit U-bend, arguably the best we can hope for is a shit deal on\u0026nbspservices and a cheap giggle. Contrary to what half you lot told us, they can’t do us a bespokehaute-couturered-white-and-bluemoney-spraying Brexit. The pretend landlord of the Queen Victoria pub appears\u0026nbspto have figured this out, and is trying to salvage a point from the tie. Why haven’t you?Chiefly amusing, however, is the erstwhile Danny\u0026nbspDyer’s Deadliest Men presenter scooping David\u0026nbspCameron on his own memoirs. I don’t know what\u0026nbspthe former prime minister has been tossing off in his £25,000 shepherd’s hut over the past 23 months, but\u0026nbspI can already tell you it will lack the sparse precision of Dyer’s summary. In fact, if they want it to sell the book to people other than nerdy completists like me, then the publishers should consider running Danny’s precis as a cover quote. I’ve no idea what the book’s title will be – let’s hope it’s one of Cameron’s catchphrases, like It Was The Right Thing To Do – but I’d love to see the words “Twat … Danny Dyer” emblazoned above the\u0026nbsptitle, to bring in the punters.As for how Theresa May will characterise the coming summer of heatwaves and cabinet warfare in her own eventual memoirs, who can say? But with the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator privately warning there are just six weeks to go before both sides are required to sign a final deal, the situation must – in the words of the Chips Channon de nos jours – be freaking her absolute nut out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eec4b34252269df7ca83d851f2bc114a1e4df84/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abe5065fe306f4a886fac2f6ad79a59","title":"jacinda ardern is the very hero the global left needs right now","story":"The future of the left is bright if it looks like Jacinda Ardern and Alexandria Ocasio-CortesAs social media birth announcements go, Jacinda Ardern’s handheld Facebook Live of herself and her newborn Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford is charming.New Zealand’s prime minister introduces her new baby with radiant sincerity. She thanks her midwife and the hospital staff for their generous professionalism, and New Zealanders for their kindness and gifts. With a quick cutaway, she even jokes with the baby’s father about his “dad jumper”.But as a political communication, the video is matchless. In an epoch overcast by growing shadows of reenergised rightwing authoritarianism, Ardern’s public hospital nativity offers a luminous symbolic affirmation of her leadership not just of New Zealand, but of the western electoral left.The leader of the first Labour government in New Zealand for a decade shares the explicit left agenda for investment in health, education and climate action, public housing, social justice. Ardern’s pledge to build “a kind and equitable nation where children thrive, and success is measured not only by the nation’s GDP but by better lives lived by its people” is the ancient standard of our side. Yet while recent celebrity left leaders have failed to win elections, or even nominations, Ardern gained the leadership of her party seven weeks out from an election, and she won. To understand why is to look beyond policy and into her representation of it. What distinguishes Ardern is her active embrace of what Walter Benjamin referred to as “the time of the now” and the erse and complex identities of a community that no longer sees itself as by, for and of propertied, straight white men. Doing so shatters a traditionalism that imprisons the left even as much as it inspires today’s right.Ardern is the first elected world leader to ever go on maternity leave. Of this, former NZ Labour prime minister Helen Clark noted: “These are the kinds of practical arrangements working women make the world over – the novelty here is that it is a prime minister who is making them. The signal this sends, however, is that this is life in the 21st century.” But the insight is enhanced by considering theorist Stuart Hall’s old observation that “Politics does not reflect majorities, it constructs them”. Local NZ commentator, Michelle Duff, lauded the events of Ardern’s maternity as a national achievement, writing, “Let’s just take a moment to appreciate that we, as a nation, have pushed the boundaries and created an environment where this can happen.” Clark said for New Zealand, this was merely “evolution”.Observe, also Ardern – who is Pakeha, not Maori – meeting the British queen wearing a Kahu huruhuru: a Māori feathered cloak “bestowed on chiefs and dignitaries to convey prestige, respect and power”. It was a demonstration of a status conferred, and not stolen, and a representation of a New Zealand unafraid to show pride in its indigenous past even as it engaged in diplomatic pleasantry with its colonial one. In this case, the spokeswoman was responding to Ardern’s choice of “Te Aroha” as her newborn’s middle name, which refers both to a mountain where Ardern grew up an a Maori language word for love. “Everybody knows what aroha means,” says Ardern in her baby video. Even though“everybody” doesn’t, every New Zealander certainly does. Ardern’s grasp of the local – from giving birth in a public hospital, to announcing her pregnancy on Instagram – is exemplary. The town of Te Aroha is planning a celebration of their namesake baby’s birth plans are to paint its buildings pink.The achievement here is Ardern’s marriage of the old left economic programme with the new explicitness of identity politics – and it resonates because it’s sincere. Failure to bridge these positions will doom all of us.Theorist Wendy Brown explained this in her 1999 essay of prophetic relevance to today’s particular political moment. Brown writes of a “left melancholy” as a state of wilful, purist political nostalgia, in which the left “has become more attached to its impossibility than to its potential fruitfulness, a Left that is most at home dwelling not in hopefulness but in its own marginality and failure, a Left that is thus caught in a structure of melancholic attachment to a certain strain of its own dead past.” It’s hard not to see this melancholy in the celebration of electoral defeats as somehow moral victories, when across the world the present, visible reality for women, indigenous people, the LGBTQIA+ community, refugees and so many others is that electoral outcomes represent life and death stakes. The alternative proposition is to remember “that the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power” – and they should pursue power, without shame. This statement was quoted by the victorious Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes, who delivered a shock upset to the established order when she won a Democratic primary in New York this week. In a party where the top three positions are held by septuagenarians, commentator Dana Milbank saw Ocasio-Cortes’s election not as a disruption to the Democratic trajectory but an event of happy augury. “The emerging electoral majority that already dominates the party and will soon dominate the country,” he observed “(is) progressive, young, female and nonwhite. It is no accident that Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old Latina, is all four.”If today’s left is going to stand a chance against an ascendant, muscular right, my hope is that she and other avowed socialists emerging within her electoral generation eschew the stale temptations of left melancholy for energising examples of a visionary left that looks as different to its past as a pregnant woman in a feathered cloak does to a room of suited men.“Strong men” of the right are now lining up governments from Italy to Turkey to the USA. The times of the now are ones in which we can construct majorities of a ersity they cannot – and do not wish to – represent. We can hope the influence of Jacinda Ardern and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes spread, or we can ensure that it does. The stakes for the marginalised remain life and death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d633b476af3d19b39f704b9ae939c9b09099ac5d/0_76_2952_1771/master/2952.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6d574199f0cdc36e7c195d9c5309a8c","title":"the guardian view on the eu migration deal fault lines in the fortress","story":"Europe’s leaders came up with a last-minute deal on migration. But it may not last, it may not work and the political sting has not been drawnThe politics of migration are an entirely different matter. They follow a separate path. Austria and Italy have both elected hardline governments in recent months to join the eastern bloc of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in resisting refugees and opposing any EU quota system. Germany’s coalition government is also under huge internal pressure to take a\u0026nbspmuch tougher approach than in the past.Seen from Britain, the June 2018 EU summit in Brussels was supposed to be a milestone in the Brexit process. In reality, the EU council barely debated Brexit at all. There was a brief speech on the first evening by Theresa May, and a discussion among the 27 on Friday which generated an even briefer, though notably bad-tempered, communique. The difficult Brexit issues have all been postponed. Instead, the issue that forced the 28 national leaders to argue among themselves until dawn on Friday was not Brexit, but migration.It was very important that the EU struck its deal this week. Failure to do so would have signalled the union’s impotence in the face of external migration and of the politics that this migration has thrown up in almost every member state. It might also have brought down Angela Merkel’s government, leading to a power vacuum within the EU on the eve of Donald Trump’s hostile and troublemaking visit to Europe next month, and perhaps also triggering a domino process of national border closures that would have brought the Schengen free travel area to its knees.Whether the deal will last, or will work, or will begin to draw the sting of the migration issue are all profoundly doubtful, however. It is very hard to be confident that any of these things will happen. The summit communique may say that the issue is one for Europe “as a whole”, but the practical reality is that differences were papered over, not resolved. The EU’s much-vaunted principles of solidarity were\u0026nbspconspicuous by their absence in words of studied vagueness.Crucially, the 28 were as unwilling as ever to share the impact of refugees. Italy’s demands got nowhere because of blanket central European objections (backed by Britain). Instead Italy’s grievances were ultimately bought off by a voluntary system of new “control centres” in those countries willing to allow them, in which the claims of rescued migrants would be processed. There were, though, few details and the position of humanitarian NGOs was ignored.The response to Mrs Merkel’s insistence that all member states should commit to take “all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures” to prevent refugees from heading across internal EU borders in order to get to Germany is equally problematic. Though Greece seems willing to work with Germany on this, it is unlikely that Italy, in particular, will do what Berlin wants. Relief for the German chancellor may not last long, especially if Mr Trump, who has Germany in his sights over trade and military spending, has his way.The leaders backed plans to put more money and resources into external border controls and agreed to create “processing centres” outside Europe. But it remains to be seen whether these commitments are bankable or effective. This was a very fractious summit on a deeply isive issue, and it may signal a more fractious EU, not an EU that has pulled back from the brink. Italy’s attempt to block every single summit conclusion on every subject unless its migration control demands were satisfied may have gone down well among anti-migrant Lega voters back home. But it signalled that, if this is a “fortress Europe”, it is a fortress full of faultlines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c39f36eb50de2d034a51c2bef5142bf530f41681/0_0_7138_4284/master/7138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9126e372c34200bd3b74d8e6a8ced6a","title":"unbelievable uk homes rent airbnb","story":"Eco pods, beach retreats and treehouses – just a few of the many unique properties for a home from home on your next UK break"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d192f52215f68aec561dab7b931534ab20c8fd21/0_778_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f701302a952c14dea0b1ed98c393251f 660w","title":"what wore this week cropped trousers jess cartner morley","story":"Would you rather look like Audrey Hepburn – or Oliver Twist?I have a confession. I haven’t always been completely honest.I fess up to almost everything: which fashions I think we should borrow from and which I think we should ignore what I have learned from my own outfits that worked and what I have learned from those that didn’t. The bit that I have sometimes fudged is that when I have these conversations in my head, they focus more on the degree to which clothes are or are not flattering than ends up on the page. I filter it out from what I say out loud.Now, there are good reasons for this. Whether or not they are flattering is the least interesting, most reductive way to talk about clothes. Spending the whole time craning over your shoulder to critique your back view in the mirror is the quickest way to suck the joy out of fashion. Also, the internal logic that tells me I “can’t” wear a short skirt doesn’t mean that someone else can’t wear one. Setting stupid rules in my head for myself is stupid enough – but setting stupid rules in my head for other people is a stupid step too far.So, anyway, today I sat down to write about cropped trousers and I thought, well, obviously it’s about getting the right combination of trouser width and heel height so that your ankles look OK. Then I thought, I can’t write that! Ankles hinge your feet to your legs, enabling you to walk. Any ankle that does that is a top-notch ankle. Which is true. But it is also true that most of us would rather look like Audrey Hepburn than like Oliver Twist while baring our ankles in short trousers.There is always an easy way to get an elegant line, which is by wearing very high heels with everything, but I don’t think a cropped-trouser day is usually a four-inch-heel day, so I try not to cheat. A cropped-trouser day is probably a relaxed day when you want to mooch about on foot. So without hoicking yourself on mega-heels, the best cropped-trouser strategy is to pair slim trousers with relatively dainty flats (a slender loafer is your modern version of a ballerina pump here) or to team wide trousers, like the ones I’m wearing here, with a modest block heel. (A chunky two-inch heel is infinitely more comfortable than a skinny one of the same height.) A bold, wide-legged trouser with a meek shoe looks unfinished, as if you have been caught in beta commute-footwear and have your proper shoes in your bag a slim capri pant with chunky shoes is a bit 90s girl band. Not that there’s anything wrong with 90s girl band as a look. I’d just rather go with Audrey, if I’m being honest. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

On a beat-by-beat basis, writer-director Matt Palmer’s feature debut skates close to the edge of cliche – only to swerve suddenly in an interesting new direction almost every time. It makes for a work that feels simultaneously familiar and fresh, just like a good, solid bout of genre-tweaking should do.Anchored by a brace of range-flaunting performances from its two leads Jack Lowden and Martin McCann, Calibre evolves unexpectedly into a moral puzzle about the limits of friendship and forgiveness. Just when you might expect Palmer to break out the fake blood, the film goes unexpectedly, and quite literally quiet, after a somewhat plodding first third. That’s a point worth stressing should you consider watching this on Netflix, given on that platform it’s so much easier to skip on to something else if the opening 10 minutes of a film fails to grab you. In the foundational first section, we meet Vaughn (Lowden), a nice regular guy living in a smart street near the park in Glasgow, who is about to become a father with his partner (Olivia Morgan). Up for a bit of mock-macho manoeuvres before the onslaught of parenthood, Vaughn agrees to go on a deerstalking trip in the Highlands with his friend Marcus (Michael Fassbender-lookey-likey Martin McCann), a chum from the boys’ boarding school days who now makes serious bank in the financial sector.After a night on the lash with a couple of local lassies (slightly underused Kate Bracken and Kitty Lovett), the two set out for the woods armed with rifles, ammo and hangovers. That’s where it all goes horribly wrong, and this is definitely an instance where saying much more than that would spoil the ensuing surprises that give the film its impact. Suffice it to say, that most of the rest of the movie involves Palmer twisting the knife in the wound as the characters try to disguise their guilty cold sweat and nausea that isn’t just a result of alcohol poisoning. Amongthe more thoughtful flourishes here is the way Palmer plays with the notion of debt and investment. The locals, led by hale fellow Logan (the redoubtable character actor Tony Curran), are troubled by the community’s economic misfortunes and keen to draw Marcus and his imagined oodles of capital into shoring up the area financially. And so they lavish the young visitors from down south with hospitality they can’t refuse, no matter how eager they are to get the hell out of Dodge. The constant invitations to stay for the bonfire and ceilidh will evoke anticipation in some that this might go the way of The Wicker Man. Another welcome departure from expected form is to have the way the film emphasises the cultural, intra-national ide between urban and rural Scots – a duller, less imaginative movie might have made the unfortunate but self-centred visitors Englishman or blokes from abroad. Elsewhere, Palmer and co flirt with the conventions of horror movies, although ultimately the horror is purely psychological, not supernatural in origin. The last shot of a character’s stunned, ravaged expression – an emptied out look of despair – is truly chilling in a way that no hand suddenly shooting up from the ground or it-was-all-a-bad-dream reveal could be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6eff777d1644c19e318336c9dc6aa290a9b132/479_0_4273_2565/master/4273.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=630d35b238c38d3dfaddf93eb71dc7ad","title":"the best passers hardest workers and slowest players of the world cup so far","story":"When it comes to passing, shooting and crossing one team outclassed all others in the World Cup group stage. When it came to winning, sadly, Germany didn’t do quite so wellThe group stage is over, 48 of the 64 matches have been played, 122 goals have been scored and after the first rest day of the tournament this is the perfect time for a statistical analysis of the World Cup so far. So let’s take a deep breath and e into a worryingly deep but also enjoyably refreshing sea of stats.Spain may have only a few survivors of the tiki-taka generation that won the competition in 2010, but they still pass the ball more than anyone else. Passing is of course a good thing: eight of the tournament’s top 10 passers qualified from their groups, the exceptions being Germany, whose statistical excellence was not reflected on the pitch. They were out-passed only by Spain and Saudi Arabia, who were No4 in the pass charts (though tellingly they were joint fourth at backwards passes and just joint 14th at forward passes).Most successful passes in a game1. Spain (v Iran) 7012. Spain (v Portugal) 7003. Spain (v Morocco) 6784. Argentina (v Iceland) 6735. Brazil (v Costa Rica) 645Fewest successful passes in a game1. Iran (v Morocco) 1272. Iceland (v Argentina) 1323 Iran (v Spain) 1394 Iran (v Portugal) 1395. Sweden (v Mexico) 147In general, teams that play a lot of long balls don’t also play a lot of short balls. So Spain attempted the most short passes, but were 24th in the long-ball charts. Brazil were third on the short-passing statistics, but 31st on long passes. Saudi Arabia however enjoy long and short passes equally, ranking No2 on short passing and No3 on long passing. As for iniduals, of the 15 players who have played the most long balls, 14 are goalkeepers. The other is Toni Kroos. The good news is that Toni Kroos played very good long balls. The bad news is that Germany were still rubbish.Three of the five teams that ran the furthest during the group stages qualified for the knock-out stages, though so did two of the five teams that ran the least. But there is an enormous disparity between how hard some teams work to defend their area and win back possession, and the more laid-back attitude preferred by others. Denmark, the tournament’s hardest grafters, collectively outran Argentina, the most indolent side, by almost 250m per minute spent without the ball. Serbia, Costa Rica and Egypt were rewarded for their hard work by being among the top five teams ranked by ball recoveries. Spain were in last place, but tellingly no team won the ball more often in their opponents’ half than their 13.Distance run by teams in metres per minute out of possession – the top five1. Denmark 735.82. Serbia 719.13. Costa Rica 713.64. Egypt 704.15. Australia 668.6Distance run by teams in metres per minute out of possession – the bottom five32. Argentina 497.431. Spain 505.130. Germany 522.829. Croatia 556.128. Saudi Arabia 557.2 Germany only scored two goals in their group games, the joint lowest tally (along with 12 other teams). This may not come as a complete surprise to those who watched them labour through their matches but the statistics say otherwise: they had the most shots, the second-most shots on target, the most shots blocked and the most shots that hit the woodwork (level with Costa Rica). Nobody had more shots from inside the area, and not from outside the area either. When it came to shooting the only area where they didn’t excel (other than actually scoring, of course) is from set pieces: they only had one such attempt, the joint lowest. England and Portugal were joint top on that ranking, with seven. Another area in which Germany’s numbers are bizarrely high. This was traditionally England’s forte, but in Russia, Germany have hit 2.5 times as many crosses as the English, and not far off twice as many as the next crossiest team. But their flank-focused forays were very one-sided: while the average team at the World Cup attacked 27 times down the left flank, 28 times down the right and 21 times through the middle, Germany attacked a bang-average 27 times down the left, a slightly below-par 19 times down the middle, and a wildly excessive 49 times down the right, where Joshua Kimmich was the tournament’s top crosser. No other team attacked down either side more than 39 times (Brazil, down Neymar’s favoured left side). England, meanwhile, are beautifully balanced, with 24 attacks down each flank and 21 down the middle. The two players who have lost the ball most often are Neymar and Lionel Messi, the Brazilian being dispossessed fully six times more often than the comparatively saintly Cristiano Ronaldo. Neymar and Messi are also the players who have attempted the most dribbles, but the others at the top of those rankings have been better at keeping the ball. Neymar is clearly a highly skilled footballer, but he’s no Nordin Amrabat. Cristiano Ronaldo is the fastest player at the World Cup so far, having been clocked at precisely 34kmh. England’s Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford are among seven players tied in sixth place, with a top speed of 33.1kmh. But the slowest outfield player at the tournament – counting only those who have played 15 minutes or more, long enough to launch into a sprint or two and thus excusing the slothful Danny Welbeck, whose top speed was just 22.7kmh but whose appearance against Belgium was conveniently timed at four seconds less than our minimum – is also very familiar.England have not often featured in these charts, but that doesn’t mean that they haven’t excelled at anything, or indeed disappointed. Here’s a quick run-down:England lead the way at: England are also pretty good at:But they are not so good at:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3c139a4028453a14b932b5b14f5b79b7657f75d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2f9fe5db1e64ccfccccb1aa0fa9c37c","title":"world cup 2018 best team of the tournament so far","story":"With the group stage in Russia done and dusted, we reveal our best XI, as voted by  readersAll the 48 group-stage matches in Russia have now been played and after each of them we have asked our readers to hand out their player ratings. The verdicts have then been inputted into our guide of all the 736 players at the 2018 World Cup – and we have now gone through them to see who makes our team of the tournament so far.According to our readers, Iran’s Alireza Beiranvand gets the nod in goal and it is difficult to argue with that selection. Had a difficult upbringing and was at one stage sleeping rough in Tehran. He worked in a carwash and as a pizza delivery driver before becoming a professional footballer. He has been brilliant in Russia. Saving a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty against Portugal was only one of the highlights as he has produced several high-calibre stops and started Iran’s attacks with his long and accurate throws. Before the tournament he said: “I want to shine in the World Cup, then maybe I can join a European big club. I’d like to play at Liverpool or PSG.” He will not be short of offers. After the three games he had an average rating of 8.67, the highest of all the players in Russia.Anyone who has done player-ratings knows that the full-backs are often the most difficult players to rate. You can get to 85 minutes and suddenly wonder what they have done. This has been reflected in our readers ratings with the centre-backs outscoring the full-backs by some margin. We have therefore opted for a three-man defence with an intriguing set-up. First we have Uruguay’s Diego Godín, who led his team from the back as they won all three Group A games without conceding a goal. The dominant Godín is joined by Sweden’s Andreas Granqvist who masterminded his country’s progress to the last 16 by being the leader of a very-well organised defence as well as scoring two of the team’s six goals, both on penalties. The final member of our backline is Manuel Akanji of Switzerland. The 22-year-old Borussia Dortmund defender has been one of the revelations of the tournament so far. Where to start? Probably with Croatia. The coach, Zlatko Dalic, has arguably the most talented group of midfielders in Russia with Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic both making our team. The La Liga duo have been instrumental in Croatia’s impressive performances against Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland and it will be fascinating to see how far they can go. A third member of the Croatia midfield, the irrepressible Ivan Perisic, just misses out on our XI.The Croatia pair take up the two central positions with Kieran Trippier of England on the right and Russia’s Aleksandr Golovin. Trippier has had a superb tournament so far, dominating his right side and creating so many chances for his team from set-pieces. It should be remembered that he only played against Tunisia and Panama, two of the weaker teams in the tournament (he was rested for the game against Belgium) but there is not much he can do about that. Golovin has been the hosts’ best player so far together with Denis Cheryshev but did not play in the defeat against Uruguay so ended the group phase with two eights while the latter started with two eights and was then given a five in the final group game. In a central attacking role, ahead of Modric and Rakitic, our readers have opted for Spain’s Isco. He has shown no signs of slowing down after a long season with Real Madrid and has been sublime to watch and was given an eight against Portugal, a seven against Iran and an eight again in the draw against Morocco. One of the players of the tournament so far.The readers’ two-man forward line is made up of Harry Kane and Romelu Lukaku. It is no surprise, perhaps, that they are both from Group G and were able to score against Panama and Tunisia but they both recorded on eight out of ten and one nine out of ten. They were then rested for their final game and therefore ended the group stage with an average rating of 8.5. Eden Hazard, Peru’s André Carrillo, Nigeria’s Ahmed Musa and South Korea’s Son Heung-min were other contenders for a place in the XI.

After 48 matches, 116 goals and a thrillingly varied swag-bag of drama, big-name angst and rolling VAR-palaver, Russia 2018 has now reached its midpoint.These things invariably alter from week to week, the tone and texture of a tournament defined by a few key games. But as the World Cup takes a breath, hitches its shorts up and contemplates a final punt through the laces at the knockout stage, it already feels like a tournament with its own distinctive character.Yes, it’s that time already. Welcome to That Was The Russia 2018 Group Stage that was.Whatever your view on the ultimate quality of the football, it has been a brilliantly entertaining World Cup so far, with few of the mind-numbingly dull games that have occasionally dogged the group stage.From the high-ceilinged quality of Portugal and Spain battering away at each other like a pair of hall-of-fame Mexican middleweights to the novel spectacle of simulcast video referee shenanigans to the emphasis so far on team play over star power: Russia 2018 has found its own shapes, mushroomed into some unexpected areas and confirmed some well-honed truths.Some of the big notes were nailed at the start. The host nation has played well and remains fully engaged. The opening game at the Luzhniki Stadium was a brilliantly staged piece of theatre, complete with an enjoyably opaque address from Vladimir Putin, iconic alpha-dog shots of Gianni Infantino lurking like an overattentive blini-waiter between Putin and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and a 5-0 defeat of a wretched Saudi Arabia.The grounds have all been ready and fit for purpose. Russia’s volunteers have been friendly and accommodating. And around the edges the social spirit of the country has come to the fore. Rather than battering visiting fans about the head with knuckledusters, the Russian people have been excellent hosts on the whole, often to a fault. There are plenty of tales of unsolicited rescues from the wrong side of town, drinks bought in bars and lost property returned.Undoubtedly Russia has prepared a face to meet the faces, its cities carefully scrubbed and posed, as is usually the case. But the top line, entirely unsurprisingly, is that this is just another country like all the other countries, built to a larger scale but with the usual variety of all human life. The basic spectacle of Senegalese, Moroccans, Peruvians and South Koreans twirling their flags around Red Square felt like an arresting transformative moment in itself.On the pitch the football has been relentlessly moreish, to the extent a rest day now feels like a hardship to be grudgingly endured. Some stats thrown out by the Fifa machine: Russia 2018 has seen an average of 2.54 goals per game in the group stage, slightly down on Brazil 2014 but up on every other World Cup of the last 30 years except for France 98 and USA 94.Belgium are top scorers with nine. Uruguay have yet to concede at all. Forty-seven goals have come in the first half, and 75 in the second. One could go on. Javier Mascherano, whose World Cup has once again resembled the harrowing final scenes of a notably gore-stained 1980s Vietnam war movie, has committed the most fouls.Neymar has been fouled an astonishing 17 times, though this depends on one’s specific definition of the words “being fouled”. Lionel Messi and Victor Moses are among five players tied on most handballs so far (two), another strand to the never-ending Moses v Messi debate.The fastest player so far, with a top speed of 34kph, is Cristiano Ronaldo, who is, lest we forget, 33 years old and in his 16th season as a pro. Finally, and another tribute perhaps to the reach of VAR, only one player has been booked for ing. Surprisingly this is dear old Son Heung-min, who might just feel a little wronged on that score.When it comes to the best teams so far Croatia are the obvious choice. The 3-0 defeat of Argentina is the outstanding result along with Mexico’s surgical dismantling of Germany. Luka Modric is arguably the outstanding player of the tournament to date. Belgium have looked like the genuine contenders their depth of talent suggests. The arm-wrestle between Portugal and Uruguay on Saturday will see a meeting of two teams with the necessary tournament bastardy, plus elite attackers in form.Otherwise everyone is below the radar, still looking to come to the boil. France have looked stodgy for all their dazzling talent. Brazil still seem to be finding a workable groove. Germany had more shots than anyone else but finished bottom of their group, victims of the dedication to method and systems that served them so well but brought a strange kind of entropy at this tournament. Spain have looked slow and underpowered at times but showed moments of exhilaratingly pure champion quality in the exchanges between Isco and Andrés Iniesta.Beyond this there has been a refreshing refusal to bow to the star players of club football. Ronaldo has been productive as ever but a semi-fit Neymar has had 17 shots at goal, scoring only once, and made 24 failed dribbles. Messi has produced just the one otherworldly moment. This is a different game from the relentless numbers of club football, each team stacked with a greater variety of human talent. The knockout phase, with its fine point details, may provide a more hospitable centre stage.There have been obvious tactical changes, alterations to the game’s rhythm driven by technology. Aided by the video referee, and by a lack of defensive prep from some teams, set pieces have played a large part. There have been 24 penalties awarded, 18 scored and six missed, leading to fears the game is undergoing a fundamental alteration in its gravity.Some have suggested teams will now focus tactics on winning penalties, will employ specialist penalty-takers, that a kind of apocalyptic penalty fixation is the future. More likely teams will simply adapt how they defend as has already begun to happen during the tournament. Overall the lessons of VAR from Russia 2018 are that when handled brusquely, when consigned to simple howlers and obvious mistakes, a little VAR can be a good thing.Otherwise some things remain the same. The dance between possession football and counterattack continues. Predictably Spain embody one side of this, completing 400 more passes than anyone else so far. England are sixth on that list, a significant moment in itself. As the tournament winds down, as players tire and stakes grow ever higher, it seems likely the teams that pass and keep the ball best will prosper.One irritation: there has been a surprising amount of play-acting, players writhing in apparent agony holding the wrong body part or shrieking when briefly touched. No doubt this is a misguided side effect of a greater refereeing presence. Countermeasures are required to stamp it out, as they are to restrain a related rise in the haranguing of officials.A final bonus point: a total of 2,178,894 ticket holders have watched with an average attendance of 45,394. The grounds have been boisterously full, with lulls in the partisan noise often filled by sudden outbreaks of “Ross-iy-ya” from the locals.This has felt like a genuinely epic-scale World Cup, football in a big country, with a vast bloom of interest and history in every city. The weather will now change, with a more staccato feel to the more micro-managed drama of knockout football. Over to you, part two. It won’t be an easy act to follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/886e646bb71f69f7827b1e0167737797eb93f26e/108_18_1727_1036/master/1727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54a76819dddcc78ebf180df80eb7d5dd","title":"americas outcasts women trapped in cruel cycle of exploitation","story":"Caught in a recurring pattern of prostitution and incarceration, they are among the most vulnerable women in the US. Yet gaps in the criminal justice system, ruthlessly exploited by sex traffickers, make escape almost impossibleby  Annie Kelly and  Mei-Ling McNamaraKate had spent three years behind bars at Lowell Correctional Institution, Florida’s largest women’s prison, when the letters from Richard Rawls started to arrive.Men had written to Kate in prison before, but this time was different. Although she had never met him, Rawls made her feel special. He wrote that he’d seen her mugshot online and couldn’t stop thinking about her. Somehow aware that she was getting out soon, he offered her money, a home and unconditional love when she was released.The letters promised Kate a future she never imagined possible – a way out of the cycle of prostitution and incarceration that had defined her life after a childhood of chaos and abuse. Soon, Rawls stopped signing his letters “Rick” instead, he urged her: “Come on home to your daddy.”“When you’re in prison, all you think about is getting out,” Kate says. “The hours go by and it really hurts to know that nobody thinks about you in there.“So when you get a letter it’s like a gift from God. He told me everything that I wanted to hear. He said I wasn’t going to be a prostitute any more, that I could go home with him and live at his house, and that he would be the love that I was searching for.”When Kate walked out of prison, Rawls, a career criminal and convicted felon with more than 47 charges for sexual battery, child abuse, drug possession and assault, was there to pick her up. Just as he had promised.“When I got into the car, he’d brought me two sweater dresses, a bottle of Heineken and a lot of crack,” she says. “I went right back to smoking crack my first day out of prison.”When she got back to Rawls’ house, Kate knew immediately she was in trouble. Instead of the comfortable home she had been promised, the house was filthy and chaotic. Cockroaches crawled up the walls. The windows were sealed shut. And hungry, chained pit bull dogs whined and barked outside. Inside the house, Kate found half a dozen other former Lowell inmates.“It was just crazy in there, really a living hell,” she says. “At first he gave me all the drugs I wanted, but he made sure that I watched him beat the other girls and I wasn’t allowed to leave his room. Then, after two weeks, it switched up and he started telling me that I owed him for all the drugs he’d given me, and now I had to go make him money.”Four months later, a heavily armed Swat team blew in the windows of the house and arrested Rawls, who was later convicted and jailed for human trafficking.An 18-month police investigation concluded that, over the course of five years, Rawls had trafficked Kate and at least 18 other women out of jails and prisons across Florida.At the time of his arrest, he was making thousands of dollars a month from prostituting the multiple women he was keeping at the house. Controlling them with narcotics, prescription pills and brutal beatings, he touted them on street corners and escort websites.Rawls remains the only person convicted of trafficking women out of criminal justice institutions in the US. Yet his case is by no means exceptional.A Observer investigation has found that jailhouses and prison cells across the US are routinely used as recruiting grounds by pimps and sex buyers. Exploiting gaps in the criminal justice system, predators are targeting some of the country’s most vulnerable and isolated women, trapping many in an endless loop of criminalisation and exploitation.State to state, the recruitment methods being used to target victims are broadly the same.The first stage involves finding potential victims. US public record legislation means that, in many states, anyone charged with a criminal offence will have their personal data posted on government websites. The information can include mugshots, home addresses and details of criminal records. In some states, details of arrests and charges are also printed in local newspapers. This means predators can cherrypick potential targets, find where women are being held, and on what charges, and – in some cases – learn when they are likely to be released. Information posted online can also include information on bail bonds set for women awaiting court dates. Becki, a trafficking survivor from Cincinnati, Ohio, said that in 10 years coming in and out of the criminal justice system, she routinely witnessed pimps and sex buyers using corrupt bail bondsmen to access women in jailhouses.Inside prisons and jails, the use of prison and jail commissary accounts – which allow inmates to receive money from outside to spend on food, toiletries and other essentials – is a key vehicle for recruitment. In many facilities, anybody can send money to an inmate.This means that many women are, in effect, financially supported through incarceration by men on the outside, who then demand repayment when they are released.Traffickers are also using inmate bank accounts to pay in-house recruiters to scout out potential targets. “When I was in prison I’d speak to my pimp every week and tell him about what new girls had come in and then he’d send me money,” said Chloe, a former inmate at a state prison in Ohio. “I’d tell the girl he wanted whatever they needed to hear to make sure she got in that car with him when she left. It was like ordering food off a menu.”In a remote and dusty prison complex in Venus, Texas, Anthony Harris, a former pimp who who was convicted of compelling prostitution in 2015, laughs when he is asked if he’s heard about pimps recruiting women from prisons and jails.When women are released, pimps wait outside to collect them “like a line of cabs”, says Harris.Over the course of the investigation, the  was granted access inside the Western Massachusetts Regional Women’s Correctional Center. It is one of the few institutions that acknowledges it has an issue with the trafficking of inmates.Nicole Bell, a trafficking survivor and founder of Lift, a local anti-trafficking organisation, runs workshops inside the jail to prevent inmates being groomed and recruited by pimps and sex buyers. She was repeatedly incarcerated at the jail when she was in the grip of addiction and prostitution on the streets of Worcester. “Trafficking for many of these women started with a relationship that turned exploitative, or a past that has led them to drug use – but because they’re involved in prostitution and addiction and have a criminal record, they’re treated like a throwaway population,” Bell says.In the US, trafficking is defined by exploitation, with victims controlled through fraud, force or coercion.“These woman have been hurt and exploited by people their whole lives, but society doesn’t care what happens to them,” says Bell. Inside the jail, female inmates showed letters from men they didn’t know. In an effort to befriend them, the senders offered to send them cash and provide them with money, drugs and housing after their release. This grooming process often goes on for months. “It gets so lonely in here,” says Jill, 24, her tiny frame swamped by a baggy regulation orange jumpsuit. This is her 22nd time in the jailhouse. “I have a boyfriend on the outside but he lets me prostitute, so does he really love me? And he lies to me all the time. When you get the letters from these men, sometimes you want to believe what they’re telling you is real.”She shrugs her shoulders. “When you’re in jail, you’re all alone. Sometimes, without them we’d have nobody,” she says. “My family won’t help me.”Many of the women here know the men writing to them are pimps or sex buyers, but say that without their support they’d have nowhere to go when released.“I know girls who survive in here because of the men,” says Katrina, another inmate. “Imagine you’re in here for a year and they’re supporting you. What do you think they want when we get out? Imagine you say you don’t want to go back to disrespecting your body. That’s just not going to fly. Nothing’s for free, I’ve learned that.”While many women in America’s booming $9.5bn (£7.2bn) sex trade work independently, pimp-controlled prostitution is now widely acknowledged as one of the most brutal and pervasive forms of human trafficking in the US.Of the 20 trafficking survivors who contributed to the investigation, the majority alleged they had been arrested multiple times for crimes committed while they were under the control of a trafficker.“Vulnerable women who are being controlled and exploited continue to be arrested every day,” says Rebecca Bender, a national anti-trafficking advocate. She says a recent move in many states away from arresting women for prostitution has been falsely held up as a solution to the criminalisation of trafficking victims.“There is little awareness that many women in a trafficking situation are also forced into many different illegal activities, which make them a target for re-arrest by the police,” she says.The impact of having a criminal record often makes it impossible for women leaving incarceration to find employment and safe housing, or to regain custody of their children.“I try to help them when they get out but we don’t have a safe house, so when they’re released the traffickers are the ones who can help meet their basic needs,” says Bell. “It’s a matter of survival.”Solutions, say advocates like Bell and Bender, have to start inside the facilities themselves, where there is an urgent need for staff training and more interventions to support women.Since the Rawls case, the Department of Corrections in Florida has implemented anti-trafficking training and awareness measures designed to educate staff and inmates about human trafficking.In a statement to the , the Florida Department of Corrections said it had fully cooperated with the Rawls enquiry and added: “The department is committed to preventing human trafficking and working with our partners in law enforcement to ensure any inidual involved is criminally prosecuted. We take all allegations of this devastating crime very seriously, and have implemented aggressive measures to protect our most vulnerable populations from this enterprise.”For many, however, support either in prison or outside is simply not available. “These are some of the most vulnerable, high-risk iniduals in our society,” says Bell. “At the moment, most are just trapped in a continuous loop of abuse and exploitation.”• Living in Freedom Together supports survivors of sexual exploitation in Massachusetts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/388c51111d7210479d4f517e9e2eaffa51f0fdf2/0_166_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97592590f04502ceb74dee77a689731f","title":"in the red again george osborne leads evening standard to 10m loss","story":"Formerly profitable freesheet, edited by ex-chancellor, has spent big to develop its brandThe Evening Standard has reported a loss of £10m for last year to the end of September, as the cost of “strategic investment” under new editor George Osborne pushed the London free daily newspaper deep into the red.Parent company ESI Media, which is controlled by Russian oligarch Evgeny Lebedev, also reported that stablemate the Independent has almost doubled profits to £3.26m in its first full year as a digital-only publication.The company said the Evening Standard’s swing to a major loss was because it has embarked on a strategic investment programme to develop the brand, editorial product and advertising proposition. It made a £2.2m operating profit in 2016. In 2015, it made £3.3m.ESI Media said the investment phase included “strong editorial innovation under former chancellor George Osborne”, who controversially took over as editor in May last year. Since his appointment, there has been a comprehensive redesign of the paper and the word “London” has been dropped from the title to reflect greater national and international ambitions. The paper has also invested heavily in the event market, including a London food festival. However, the title, which has a circulation of almost 900,000, was also hit hard by the ongoing slump in the advertising market. As a freesheet, it does not have the benefit of additional income from sales of each copy, making it particularly vulnerable. “We’re investing significantly in the Evening Standard,” said Manish Malhotra, group managing director at ESI Media. “Although the title has been subject to some broader issues that have impacted on all news brands, the brand is now enjoying strong digital growth and the emergence of a successful events business to complement the print title reinvigorated under George’s editorship.”The Standard also took on costs as a result of the closure in 2016 of the print edition of stablemates the Independent and Independent on Sunday.Malhotra said: “The Independent is demonstrating strong growth in profits and turnover following its move to a digital-only business. This is enabling us to continually invest in the brand, particularly in our US presence, to better serve our large, engaged and valuable global audience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19296e46760b0bdcc5bd0bfd68bde9fd410e2017/0_0_7000_4201/master/7000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1009ab003e4200e5d10bfcdb66cfc8b","title":"lets move to surrey quays london","story":"It’s quiet and relatively affordable right now – but about to get very busyWhat’s going for it? This corner of south-east London has been “regenerated” once before.

It was a banal vision of the future, compared with the area’s heroic past: mac ’n’ cheese or BBQ chicken pizza rather pales beside trading whales with Greenland, hauling forests from the Baltic, giving the Pilgrim Fathers a send-off, etc etc. So they’ve come up with a new plan. Worry not, nostalgists for the 80s: the Barratt homes and marinas are staying, as is Printworks, which once churned out Daily Mails, but now churns out EDM for the clubbing masses.

Moreover, he says, the comments are “killing me”, so much so that the personal note written by Drake and attached to Scorpion is entirely comprised of negative ones: DRAKE IS FINISHED, DRAKE IS A POP ARTIST, DRAKE MAKES MUSIC FOR GIRLS, etc.That seems astonishing on one level, and offers a curious insight into the life of one of the most successful artists of his era. It would appear that a man who’s had more Billboard Hot 100 hits than any solo artist in history spends his time sequestered away in his $8m Hidden Hills mansion ignoring the entreaties of neighbours Miley Cyrus and LeAnn Rimes to join them for a boozy barbecue in favour of rummaging around below the line and fulminating over what baz_27 has to say about him. “Scrolling through life and fishing for praise,” he offers on Emotionless, as a sample of Mariah Carey’s Emotions wails in the background. “Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways.”But on another level: well, of course he does. From the start, Drake’s whole schtick has revolved around solipsism and self-pity – how could he resist such a rich seam of inspiration, so many reasons to feel sorry for himself?If it’s true, then he can hardly have missed the gag that began circulating online when Scorpion was announced as two albums – one rap, one R\u0026ampB – prompting a wag on Twitter to remark, “Biggie released a double after he died too”, earning himself 12,000 retweets in the process, the joke being that Drake seems to have come off noticeably the worse in his beef with Pusha-T and Kanye West.Said beef shows no sign of letting up over the course of Scorpion. On the album closer, March 14, he deals with Pusha’s big allegation – that Drake fathered a secret son – in a way that you have to say is impressively on-brand. Above sparse backing involving nothing more than drums and an impressively warped, psychedelic D’Angelo sample, he admits the “harsh truth”, promises to be there for his child, then turns his attention to underlining the real victim in all of this, which, with a certain thundering inevitability, turns out to be Drake. “I’m out there on the front lines, trying to make sure that I see him sometimes, it’s breaking my spirit,” he raps, before breaking into an old Boyz II Men song: “No one to cry on, I’m all alone, I need shelter from the rain to ease the pain.”Elsewhere, Drake takes aim at West’s line about him being light-skinned, mocks him for the 2016 rumours that he was $56m in debt and huffs that West and Pusha-T’s recent albums were of uneven quality: “When I heard the shit I was skipping through that.” He sounds committed – as if the ongoing war of words has forced him on to his mettle – and he has a point, although one might reasonably respond: look who’s talking. You can understand Drake’s desire to make a grandiose statement that covers every musical base from trap to the 90s R\u0026ampB slow jam of After Dark, but the problem with Scorpion is that there isn’t quite enough strong material here to support its gargantuan running time. There is audible flab in the flat I’m Upset and Nonstop, and the featherweight pop of Ratchet Happy Birthday. Some missteps seem baffling – Mob Ties, a dreary, by-numbers homage to Migos frankly feels a bit beneath him – and others overly familiar: Finesse is another one of those minor, melodically rambling Drake tracks that gives every impression that he’s just making it up as he goes along.It’s infuriating because Scorpion is frequently fantastic, making a stronger claim for Drake’s greatness than any amount of swaggering braggadocio. Don’t Matter to Me isolates a Michael Jackson sample (from an unreleased vocal cleared by Jackson’s estate) over pillowy synthesisers, emphasising the overlooked eeriness of his voice. Summer Games is a bold exercise in minimalism – an electronic riff that consists of one note runs through the entire song – and feels hypnotic rather than wearying. The DJ Premier-produced Sandra’s Rose is a gorgeous confection of old soul samples and churchy organ.For an artist who’s not exactly renowned for his sense of humour, there’s a real wit about In My Feelings’ incorporation of a scene referencing Drake in Donald Glover’s TV comedy Atlanta. And if Finesse represents Drake’s Auto-Tuned meandering at its most shaggy, then Peak shows that approach at its best: crawl-paced and authentically weird, its atmosphere of small-hours melancholy supported by harsh electronic tones and the unexpected sound of British MC Stefflon Don and some schoolfriends discussing the state of their love lives.Whatever anyone’s saying in the comments section or on social media, Drake is such a huge star that Scorpion is a guaranteed smash. You wouldn’t be surprised if it breaks yet another streaming record. But the fact that it’s a good album that could have been great had a firmer editing hand been applied perhaps tells you more about the isolation of mega-fame than any of its author’s depictions of moneyed angst: it offers the sound of a world in which no one will tell a superstar that enough is enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a8528b01cbf8919bcacb7beb83ccdcacc28c65b/0_0_3061_2200/master/3061.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62fe2034d44864caa376093179a611a3 700w","title":"women often feel patronised by doctors health minister says","story":"‘Overwhelmingly male’ environment is affecting treatment of common issuesWomen struggle to get their needs met by doctors because the profession is “overwhelmingly male”, a health minister has suggested.Jackie Doyle-Price, the minister for mental health, said that in her experience, many women felt “patronised” and “diminished” when trying to access health treatments.“The doctor is the expert, the patient defers and basically presents themselves saying, ‘fix me’,” she said. “But actually, there needs to be a proper conversation about that.“There are a lot of issues about the asymmetry in that relationship, but they become particularly acute when you look at women. Quite often, the profession is still overwhelmingly male.”She added: “There is not a single female MP who hasn’t told me at some point they felt patronised and diminished whilst trying to access health treatments.” Doyle-Price said that if female MPs, who were “pushy, articulate, good-at-looking-after-ourselves kinds of women”, had problems, then it suggested there was a wider issue. Doyle-Price said this was a positive sign, but that the legacies of a previously “very male-dominated profession” remained. Doyle-Price said there was a lot of ignorance about fairly common female conditions with the potential for “seismic” impacts, such as endometriosis, fibroids and even the menopause, because women did not like talking about them. One in 10 women has endometriosis, but it takes an average of seven to eight years to be diagnosed. The charity Endometriosis UK has suggested that women with the disorder were often overlooked by doctors unless they were trying to conceive. Doyle-Price said the vaginal mesh scandal, in which thousands of women had to have the implants removed because of complications, was “an example of how there isn’t a proper conversation between women and health professionals about the conditions that affect them”. Women, in particular, needed “much more informed consent” to any procedure or medication they were given, she said.Doyle-Price said public education was needed to stop women suffering in silence. “We need to be much more sensitive to the particular needs of women, because the reality is, our bodies are different,” she said. “We have issues that cause more and more morbidities than men would have. That’s just a fact of life.”They also face a gender pay bias at the highest levels. The BBC reported earlier this year that just five of the 100 highest-paid consultants in England were women, with the top-paid man earning nearly £740,000 – two-and-a-half times that of the top woman.A study published last year found that female doctors were more empathetic than male doctors, and that this probably made them better doctors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9713858c5fffb007e13f9aa2d3472ccb43c61/567_327_3410_2046/master/3410.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fe36a1ddeb66a7e70628b4c42de16ba","title":"gb sprinters linford christie 100m record","story":"Reece Prescod, Zharnel Hughes and CJ Ujah lead the race to break 25-year-old record at national trials in BirminghamIt is one of the most prestigious and robust records in British track and field history. But shortly after tea-time on Saturday, Linford Christie’s national 100m best of 9.87sec – which has stood for 25 years – could finally be toppled.It speaks volumes for the strength in depth of British sprinting that there are three athletes with the speed in their legs, and the fire in their bellies, at the British Championships in Birmingham.Reece Prescod, who has run a wind-assisted 9.88sec and beat the world champion, Justin Gatlin, in May, said: “Everyone is raising their game and we have a really competitive field in Birmingham. It is probably the best ever 100m at trials. The record could definitely go on the right conditions and the right day.”Zharnel Hughes, who ran a personal best of 9.91sec this month, is even bolder. “The crowd will be in for something spectacular,” he said. “I’m not putting any expectations on myself but records are meant to be broken.”CJ Ujah, the reigning Diamond League 100m champion, is also gunning for Christie’s record, set in Stuttgart in 1993, as well as one of the three places on offer for the European Championships in August while Ojie Edoburun, who set a personal best of 10.04 three weeks ago, cannot be discounted.The expectation is that Prescod, who has kicked on impressively after finishing seventh in last year’s world championships, is the man to beat. Especially as he believes his recent performances only hint at his potential. “There is no limit to speed,” he said. “I still have so much to work on, so I know I can go faster than 9.8, so in the 9.7s. It won’t happen overnight but in a few years when I have got stronger and worked on my start a lot more, I feel like anything is possible.“If I told myself last year I would run 9.88 windy, I would have said no way, but you have to surprise yourself. Things happen.”In the past, the 100m was the ultimate mano a mano contest, with athletes glaring and talking the talk in the call room in an attempt to unsettle their rivals. But Prescod insists that there is no animosity among the new wave of British sprinters, who realise that if they get on with each other it can enhance their chances of a 4x100m relay gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.“Back in the day it was eyeballing, and who was the strongest man in the call room, but to me that is just a waste of energy,” Prescod said. “So I don’t go out there all angry. I have a little dance, set the blocks down and go. I am still young, I can’t be angry.”Even if Christie’s record does not fall in Birmingham there is a looming sense that it is on borrowed time, especially given that Prescod, Hughes and Edoburun are only 22, while Ujah is 24.The men’s 100m is the highlight of two days of competition that organisers hope will put British athletics back on the sporting map before next month’s World Cup – which a worryingly high number of big names are set to swerve – and the Anniversary Games a week later at the London Stadium.Last year, the UK trials had a distinct lack of stars – Mo Farah, Greg Rutherford, Laura Muir and Katarina Johnson-Thompson were all missing – and an absence of bums on seats. To make matters worse, when Ujah broke 10 seconds for the 100m, it took 10 minutes for his time to show because of technical problems.This time, though, most of the big names are back – although Rutherford misses out because of appendicitis and Farah has since quit the track – and UK Athletics insists that ticket sales for the two days are up.Other highlights of the weekend include Dina Asher-Smith and Muir in the women’s 100m and 1500m respectively, while Shara Proctor and Lorraine Ugen, who finished third and fourth in the Commonwealth Games, square off in the long jump.In a stacked men’s 1500m, Chris O’Hare is a slight favourite ahead of Jake Wightman, the NCAA champion, Josh Kerr and Charlie Grice.In the men’s 800m, Kyle Langford, who was fourth in the world championships last year, has a stiff challenge against Elliot Giles and Andrew Osagie, who is looking to put a long run of injuries behind him since running 1min 43.77sec in the final of London 2012 and earning bronze in the world indoors in 2014."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e95c1ceec6e70245a78d74086c77ce27b069ee7b/0_214_3280_1968/master/3280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cfbbd0d225f86cdea8f22307cab2a37","title":"st helens wakefield super league match report","story":"If the Super League title is indeed destined for St Helens this season, these are perhaps the moments the Saints and their supporters will look back on in a few months’ time and underline as season-defining.Make no mistake about it, with the way Justin Holbrook’s side are strolling on at the top of the table, these two points may not split them from whoever finishes second. But for the third time in a matter of weeks the Super League leaders found themselves in a position of jeopardy with minutes remaining and, yet again, they found a way to win.The script seemed as though it would be far more straightforward at half-time. Leading 20-6 after another irrepressible half of rugby, some St Helens fans may have been forgiven for thinking the job was done. But this Wakefield side are made of stern stuff and the way in which they fought back to lead 26-20 after an hour here illustrates they cannot be ruled out of the race for the play-offs yet.The fact they are one of only two sides to beat the Saints in 2018 also underlines that – but ultimately tries to Regan Grace, James Roby and Zeb Taia in the final 15 minutes secured victory.“I’m frustrated but equally proud,” the Wakefield coach, Chris Chester, lamented. Yet he should not be too disappointed because the manner in which they fought back with tries to Ryan Hampshire, Jacob Miller, Tom Johnstone and Mason Caton-Brown suggests there is still more to come from this side.It was fitting, though, that it was Roby who scored the try which put the hosts back ahead. After playing over an hour at high-altitude six days ago in Denver, the St Helens captain delivered another tireless 80-minute display here. It did not go unnoticed.“Nothing fazes him, does it?” Justin Holbrook, Saints’ coach, said of the hooker. “He’d play tomorrow if you asked him to.” And after he muscled his way over, Taia ensured there would be no way back for Wakefield - despite Reece Lyne’s try in the final minute which set up a frenetic final few seconds. This time, however, the Saints would not fall behind again.The scenes at full-time were all too familiar: and the scale of the celebrations illustrated just what a battle the Super League leaders had been in.

Now he’s back, for just a short run, performing his first live comedy in six years.The programme at Dance Base features work from 11 countries and includes the Grassmarket venue’s first full-scale ballet, Giselle by Ballet Ireland. But the eye-catcher on this year’s lineup is Sunshine Boy, Andy Howitt’s tribute to the extravagantly lipsticked Leigh Bowery – performance artist, designer, sitter for Lucian Freud, Clothes Show star and legend of London’s club world, whose signature act involved giving birth to his partner on stage.Her 2016 debut made waves, her 2017 follow-up, Sassy Best Friend, was wonderful. This time out, the high-energy, highly-strung standup Rose Matafeo tackles horniness, of all things, and – in a year when Flight of the Conchords’ return has towered over live comedy – is part of a Kiwi invasion that includes “Lorde’s favourite comedian” Paul Williams, newcomer Alice Snedden and an all-new show from the big-hitting mime act Tape Face.His 2012 show BigMouth was an arresting collision of speeches from the Greeks to George W Bush – told with a splash of Sondheim and Nirvana – that explored how words can lead to war. Now, in a new performance, Valentijn Dhaenens returns once more to deadly rhetoric and to what makes politicians tick.The title sounds like something you’d be promised amid the flyering blizzard on the Royal Mile. But the signs look good for this monologue, co-produced by Manchester’s Royal Exchange and performed by Julie Hesmondhalgh. It was written in secret for her by her husband, Ian Kershaw, and promises, she says, to offer “a bit of love and hope”.Two credits guaranteed to give your comedy career a head start are “Gaulier-trained” and “directed by Cal McCrystal”.

Richard Thomas (Jerry Springer – the Opera) writes the tunes.Styled as a disarmingly jaunty joint lecture, Michael Pinchbeck’s multimedia show revisits John Berger and photographer Jean Mohr’s account of the life of an English country GP. Grounded in Berger’s thinking about art and perspective, it asks what drives a doctor who rises at night and slips an overcoat over his pyjamas to cross fields and answer his patient’s call – and, as the NHS marks 70 years, what drives today’s overloaded medics.An Oscar-winning actor, a director and a playwright are at loggerheads while preparing a production in this world premiere by David Ireland. The warning that it is “not for the faint of heart” will be acknowledged by anyone who saw Ireland’s blistering Cyprus Avenue, which starred Stephen Rea as an Ulster loyalist who sees the face of Gerry Adams in his baby granddaughter.No pressure, Sam Campbell, but the last three winners of the Melbourne comedy festival’s Barry award have gone on to be nominated for its Edinburgh equivalent.

Glasgow-based performer Mele Broomes presents her full-throttle, one-woman dance version of the cult classic to a pulsating soundscape and a blizzard of projections.You can’t accuse Kiri Pritchard-McLean of bandwagon-jumping. She made her show about sexism in comedy, Hysterical Woman, long before #MeToo. Its follow-up, Appropriate Adult, made remarkably lively comedy out of her experiences mentoring vulnerable kids. But this year’s show, in which the impressive Welsh comic explores gaslighting, is undoubtedly of-the-moment.A Bon Jovi musical imagined each night with the help of the audience? Writer-performer Paul O’Donnell is making his fringe debut and may well be livin’ on a prayer but he’ll make it he swears. O’Donnell turns the story of Tommy (used to work on the docks) and Gina (works the diner all day) into a zero-budget musical epic. This late-night show might just have Edinburgh hit written all over it.It won’t come as news to anyone who saw her first two shows (think emphatic party-comedy meets self-empowerment seminar) that Luisa Omielan didn’t see herself as a political animal.

Her new show, Politics for Bitches (also in development for BBC3), lays that political education bare and, as you’d expect from this most democratic of comics, invites her audience to join in.A welcome return for Sh!t Theatre’s wonderfully warm 2017 fringe smash. The duo Louise Mothersole and Rebecca Biscuit recount their pilgrimage to Dolly Parton’s Tennessee theme park and their ersion to the same state’s body farm, where human decomposition is studied. En route they unravel unexpected connections between Dolly the singer and Dolly the sheep. A show about cloning, icons and iniduality, it is full of the duo’s love not just for the country star, but for each other.Sitcom regulars Anna Crilly (taciturn housekeeper Magda in Lead Balloon) and Margaret Cabourn-Smith (Miranda’s pregnant pal, Alison) team up as a double act reunited after a decade apart for one last gig. Sexism and ageism are on the agenda in a show by standup turned playwright Danielle Ward.With bobbling bobble hats, tempestuous tents and four pairs of wobbly wellies, this dance show for children aged three to five, staged by the inclusive company Indepen-dance 4, is directed by a hero of children’s theatre, Anna Newell. The autumnal colour design is a delight, as are the dancers who weave between showers of leaves.The BBC and Avalon are presenting four debut dramas at the fringe, written by former Perrier winner Frank Skinner, journalist Bim Adewunmi, Bafta-winning director Beryl Richards and the ever-excellent actor Katherine Parkinson, whose play Sitting finds three people posing for a painting in an artist’s studio years apart from each other.If you can judge a comic by the quality of her collaborators, Kate Berlant’s Edinburgh debut would be a home banker. In the US, the LA native is celebrated for her double act with Search Party star John Early, and also popped up in Reggie Watts’s Netflix special Spatial. But her solo work is just as acclaimed: the New York Times placed her “at the forefront of experimental comedy”.Jamali Maddix had no sooner established himself in live comedy when TV came calling – and the success he had hosting Viceland’s documentary Hate Thy Neighbour, about racial hatred and resurgent rightwingery, propelled him directly into the big league. This year’s fringe dates spearhead a maiden world tour for the Ilford boy, with a new show promising “more personal tales of hate and moral confrontation from his travels around the world”.Once seen, Jessie Cave’s 2015 show I Loved Her was never forgotten. A heartfelt, hyper-neurotic account of the anxieties and obsessions attendant on her life with fellow comic (and father of her child) Alfie Brown, it took oversharing to the nth degree. Now she’s back for the first time since, with another DIY solo show (“confessional comedy meets DIY performance art,” she calls it) about motherhood, Instagram and getting through a breakup.The fringe’s From Start to Finnish season includes circus, drama and a mask-theatre show about Finland’s myth of an elf that lives in the sauna. Meanwhile, the Helsinki-born choreographer Ima Iduozee performs his minimalist, shape-shifting solo This Is the Title, bringing a kind of hypnotic stillness to his B-boy stylings.Most people wouldn’t be able to name the 14 events in a tetra-decathlon, let alone compete in one. But Lauren Hendry cheerily decided to give a world championships a go despite being a self-proclaimed “serious amateur”. Her one-woman show is a 60-minute stroll through what happened, directed by Jenna Watt, who won strong reviews for Faslane in 2016.Pleasance at EICCToddlers can be the toughest theatre critics, but Starcatchers are a safe bet to keep young ones enchanted. The company’s co-production with Curious Seed, for the under-threes, invites the audience on to a nursery-style set for a closeup view of performers who make magic from the simplest of props, as they celebrate the bond between parent and child. The Mash Report host has been the go-to man for sharp political comedy for the last few years, and this year he’s back, albeit with a show billed – for its entire 24-night run – as a work-in-progress. There’s acute political humour elsewhere, too, from Ahir Shah and Ayesha Hazarika on the left, Fin Taylor antagonising everyone in the middle, and Geoff Norcott’s Toryism at the other extreme.Canadian ice-skating troupe Le Patin Libre return with their cool moves in a double bill performed in a rink that takes on epic proportions as they glide around each other, their blades cutting striking designs into the surface. Audiences watch the first part from the stands, then sit down on the ice for the second, where the gang thrillingly skate straight towards you.The Edinburgh film festival has long since shifted from August to the start of summer, but the fringe has a double dose of cult cinema courtesy of horror composer Claudio Simonetti and his band Goblin. They’re playing the intoxicatingly creepy original scores for George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead and Dario Argento’s Suspiria alongside screenings of the films.Shortlised for the Man Booker prize and the  first book award, Chigozie Obioma’s debut novel drew comparisons to both Chinua Achebe and Emile Zola. Gbolahan Obisesan’s adaptation distils the novel to focus on just two of the brothers who encounter a prophet on a fishing trip in Nigeria that spirals into tragedy.Scotland had its Colin “the British are coming!” Welland moment two years ago when an Edinburgh comedy award double-whammy, Richard Gadd and Scott Gibson, threatened a renaissance of Caledonian standup. Leading the pack of homegrown acts this year is cult TV and internet sicko Limmy, presenting the videos he made on the online platform Vine. There is also hotly tipped Christopher Macarthur-Boyd, Jay Lafferty, and a first fringe run in 25 years for Scot Squad and Absolutely star Jack Docherty.As publicity for your Edinburgh fringe run goes, winning Britain’s Got Talent can hardly be bettered. Lee Ridley, AKA Lost Voice Guy, whose cerebral palsy affects his ability to speak, performs a new show expressing scepticism of the “inspiration porn” he identifies in media depictions of disabled people. (Fellow BGT comics Robert White and Daliso Chaponda also play the fringe.)Penelope Skinner is bringing two new plays to Edinburgh this summer. Meek, which explores state control, is at the Traverse in a Headlong production, while Angry Alan is a response to both the men’s rights movement and the rise of Donald Trump. The story follows Roger, whose personal and professional life is imploding when he thinks he finds a saviour in an online activist. Skinner’s partner, Donald Sage Mackay, stars.After eccentric comedies about five-a-side (Jumpers for Goalposts) and indie bands (Broken Biscuits) comes Yorkshire playwright Tom Wells’s one-man musical about synchronised swimming and growing up gay, staged for Hull’s year as UK City of Culture in 2017. In his words, it’s about “having a go at stuff with your mates, and being 15, and wearing armbands”. It should make a splash at this popup in-the-round stage, which can really bring Edinburgh audiences together.With so many of last year’s Edinburgh award nominees not returning to compete (no Sophie Willan, no Mae Martin, no Spencer Jones), attention is bound to focus on 2017 shortlistees Mat Ewins, whose joyful DIY Indiana Jones take-off Adventureman 7 brought such uplift to Fringe 2017, and Jordan Brookes. The new show from the latter deeply destabilising presence addresses events in his personal life triggered by last year’s show.Cabaret star Le Gateau Chocolat has done Shakespeare at the Globe, performed opera at Glyndebourne and addressed his depression in an intimate fringe show, Black. This year he brings his first family show to Edinburgh. His take on The Ugly Duckling draws on his difficulties at school. “Duckie isn’t just about standing up to your bullies,” he says, “it’s about making sure that you don’t become a bully yourself.”Gary McNair has already proven himself a deft observer of both macho bravado and adolescent angst, so don’t miss his new play about a fight at the school gates. His co-writer Kieran Hurley, who had a hit with Beats, creates music-fuelled shows whose soundtracks linger long in the memory. Here, the tracks come from Glasgow group Frightened Rabbit. Elsewhere, McNair’s After the Cuts imagines a future without the NHS.After a scorching premiere in the US in 2016, Jennifer Kidwell and Scott R Sheppard’s razor-sharp and darkly comic take on race relations arrives in the UK. Two Stetson-sporting teachers deliver a lesson at a school where they don’t teach history by reading books. For a course on the American civil war, the pair ide the audience into armies and then all hell breaks loose.The documentary theatre company Lung have staged politically urgent shows exploring the Chilcot inquiry, the 1985 Bradford City fire and the campaign by single mothers in Newham, east London, against their eviction. This year, Matt Woodhead and Helen Monks (who played the teenage Caitlin Moran in Raised By Wolves) present a piece based on the inquiry into a fake plot to Islamise Birmingham schools.Whither the double act? It’s not the format it once was, but there are some fine two-piece comedy acts on the fringe, with women leading the line. Beard (Matilda Wnek and Rosa Robson) and Flo \u0026amp Joan will both be well worth a look, and there is a fringe return for Radio 4 favourites The Pin. Then there are the twisted pleasures of Norris and Parker, whose late-night offering in 2016 was a hoot. Sounds as if their new show Burn the Witch is cut from similarly macabre cloth.Nobody makes shows quite like Nick Mohammed. Performed in character as his bumptious alter ego Mr Swallow, his series of almost-solo spoof musicals (the Dracula one, the Houdini one) have been fringe highlights in recent years. In the Houdini one, you got incredible feats of escapology to boot, and the derring-do looks likely to escalate this summer, when Mohammed launches his newest spectacular on an unsuspecting world: Mr Swallow and the Vanishing Elephant.Katherina Radeva designed the 2017 Edinburgh hit Salt, in which Selina Thompson retraced the transatlantic slave triangle. Now, Redeva – who was born in communist Bulgaria – performs her one-woman show about the end of the cold war and reflects on borders past, present and future.A few years ago, they looked like the saviours of the sketch show, but Sheeps have been only an intermittent presence since. Instead, their component talents broke into TV comedy (Liam Williams’ Pls Like Al Roberts in Channel 4’s new Stath Lets Flats), producing (Williams co-runs Fight in the Dog) and theatre (Williams’ and Daran Johnson’s Ricky Whittington and his Cat). It is all the more mouthwatering then that the threesome return at this year’s fringe, with more skilful, smart and silly team comedy.Pins and Needles had a West End run with Mr Popper’s Penguins, a charming slice of Americana about a wannabe Antarctic adventurer whose home life is flipped upside down when a penguin arrives in the post. The company brings another puppet-powered, tuneful treat about an unexpected houseguest, this time based on Raymond Briggs’s book The Bear, which should be lunchtime fun.Apphia Campbell’s monologue, told with gospel and blues songs, was an awardwinner in Edinburgh in 2017 and returns for a limited run. It fuses the lives of two women: a student who fights for civil rights in the wake of Ferguson and Assata Shakur, a member of the Black Liberation Army in the 70s, who became one of the FBI’s most wanted.Cora Bissett had played only a handful of gigs with her indie band Darlingheart when, straight out of school, they landed a major record deal and found themselves on the road with Blur and Radiohead. She looks back at a three-year whirlwind of music, prompted by rereading her teenage diaries, and reflects on the future she wants for her daughter.There was once a fine (if not exactly distinguished) tradition of men playing women for comic effect. The tables have turned now, and – after Zoe Coombs Marr’s success as her sexist alter ego Dave – here comes 2017 best newcomer Natalie Palamides in character as Nate. “For the first time in history,” runs her blurb, “it’s hard to be a man” – an argument she’ll test probably to destruction in this clowning follow-up to last year’s surpassingly strange and delightful debut, Laid. Now, as then, she is directed by cult fringe favourite Dr Brown.Edinburgh resident and former Perrier award champ – back in the days when it was practically the plaything of budding Irish male standups – Dylan Moran now launches his new show Dr Cosmos at the fringe. Finally growing into the elder statesman role he’s long been fashioning for himself, Moran’s oddly wise and always off-beam commentaries on modern living will surely be one of the treats of the festival.Underbelly’s Circus Hub on the MeadowsSome of Mozart’s best known movements do just that in this new family show from the Australian company Circa, whose acrobats perform to the great composer’s music. A pair of circus performers are joined by a musician for a piece that – judging by their frequent past appearances at the festival – should hit the high notes.Disability-led performance company Birds of Paradise explore the issue of actors “cripping up” with an irreverent escapade about an am-dram society who decide to stage a musical inspired by the Daniel Day-Lewis film. Co-presented with the National Theatre of Scotland, it stars Dawn Sievewright, one of the triumphant “ladies of perpetual succour” from Vicky Featherstone’s 2015 fringe sensation.First staged before a date had been set for Ireland’s abortion referendum, Liz Roche Company’s politically urgent dance work about Irish women’s struggle for autonomy of their bodies arrives on the heels of the landslide vote to repeal the eighth amendment. It’s performed by two dancers against an abstract film and a specially commissioned poem by Elaine Feeney.His 2015 show Lance, about leaving home, losing faith and cycling, was a delight its follow-up Maestro, about classical music, was likewise Edinburgh award-nominated. After a year’s break – and now with a sitcom role in Two Doors Down under his belt – Kieran Hodgson returns with ’75, a comic storytelling solo about the first UK-in-Europe referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a0b30fc89f868ab520cbc61087d6a9e338efe2/0_361_5636_3381/master/5636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45f6e3fd602368b37417b3fe1773d665","title":"readers travel photography competition june the winners","story":"Moments of calm from Bruges to West Bengal are a theme in this month’s selection, chosen by Mick Ryan of fotoVUE.

But Austria, France, Germany and Italy made clear they had no immediate plans to open secure centres on their soil.Asked if Austria would open a centre, the prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, said: “Of course not … we are not a first-arrival country, unless people jump with parachutes.”Nonetheless, Merkel said the overall agreement was more than she had envisaged before the summit and said she believed it surpassed demands laid down by her coalition partners. Her hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, had threatened to close Germany’s borders to migrants, sparking a dispute that some feared would bring down Merkel’s government.Merkel was due to brief Seehofer’s CSU party on Friday night about the EU deal, as well as about bilateral agreements she had struck with Spain and Greece, which will require the Mediterranean countries to take back asylum seekers who had arrived in their country first before moving on to Germany.Under EU asylum rules, first-arrival countries are responsible for processing asylum claims, putting a disproportionate burden on southern states nearest north Africa and Turkey.Italy wants to tear up the first-country principle, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he did not want to change the rule, setting the stage for more confrontation over the overhaul of EU asylum rules, a process that has stalled after two years of talks.Central European countries claimed they had buried the idea of mandatory refugee quotas for all EU countries. “Now everyone has dropped the topic,” said the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, hailing that as a “a big success”.Donald Tusk, the European council president, told reporters in Brussels that it was “far too early to talk about a success”.Diplomats were left uneasy about the negotiating method of Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who pushed the summit to the brink of collapse by threatening to veto the entire summit communique, including unrelated parts on trade.When Conte, according to a source, told his fellow leaders: “I am a law professor,” the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, replied: “Well, I used to be a fireman and this is not how you negotiate.” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, added that he used to be a welder and he did not agree with the Italian’s way of making his point, either.Borissov described the Italian threat as “unpleasant” but conceded that leaders had at best reached a “fragile consensus that does not solve the whole problem”.Several EU leaders stressed they wanted to work with international agencies who were willing to set up migrant camps in north Africa to process asylum claims.However, a paper released by the UN agency for refugees and the International Organisation for Migration on Friday strikes a different tone. They called for “strong leadership from European Union member states on upholding the right to asylum and the rights of migrants”, while stressing that the EU could not outsource the problem. The agencies say they oppose closed detention centres."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11ff2e9edc5c8c67136c69933089f83577afa49/0_142_3008_1806/master/3008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc08f0c015313c342d530a18940c4767","title":"unesco names three new world heritage sites","story":"16th-century Kenyan dry-stone walled settlement, ancient city in Oman and oasis in Saudi Arabia recognised by UN bodyThree new sites have been awarded world heritage status by Unesco, including a remote Kenyan settlement and an ancient city in Oman.The 42nd session of the World Heritage Committee made the announcement on Friday afternoon following a meeting in Bahrain.The first to be named was Thimlich Ohinga in Kenya, north-west of the town of Migori. Unesco said the dry-stone walled settlement was probably built in the 16th century.It said the settlement seems to have “served as a fort for communities and livestock, but also defined social entities and relationships linked to lineage” and was the “largest and best preserved of these traditional enclosures”.“It is an exceptional example of the tradition of massive dry-stone walled enclosures, typical of the first pastoral communities in the Lake Victoria Basin, which persisted until the mid-20th century,” it added.Also listed was the ancient walled city of Qalhat in Oman, located on the east coast of the sultanate.Unesco said: “The city developed as a major port on the east coast of Arabia between the 11th and 15th centuries CE, during the reign of the Hormuz princes. Today it bears unique archaeological testimony to the trade links between the east coast of Arabia, east Africa, India, China and south-east Asia.”The last to be added on Friday was the Al-Ahsa oasis in Saudi Arabia, described as “an evolving cultural landscape in the eastern Arabian peninsula”.Unesco described the Al-Ahsa Oasis as “a serial property comprising gardens, canals, springs, wells and a drainage lake, as well as historical buildings, urban fabric and archaeological sites.”It added: “They represent traces of continued human settlement in the Gulf region from the Neolithic to the present, as can be seen from remaining historic fortresses, mosques, wells, canals and other water management systems. With its 2.5m date palms, it is the largest oasis in the world. Al-Ahsa is also a unique geocultural landscape and an exceptional example of human interaction with the environment.”The committee will make decisions on dozens more nominated places over the weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/545bd60eb02593f0d0babab0cc3deaa84c2b7c87/0_412_7259_4356/master/7259.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3999af39e26006b4ee4252ecc1f08663","title":"mongolias shamanic rituals in pictures","story":"Banned for 70 years under communist rule, the ancient practice of shamanism has been protected by Mongolia’s constitution since 1992"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548377.1530283492!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair and aer lingus cancel flights this weekend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRyanair and Aer Lingus have been forced to cancel flights this weekend because of a strike by French air traffic controllers. File photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersRyanair and Aer Lingus have been forced to cancel flights this weekend because of a strike by French air traffic controllers (ATC).On Friday, the airlines advised passengers to check their flight details for the coming weekend, and warned that numerous flights were at risk of cancellation due to the decision by French ATC workers to carry out further strike action. The industrial action is due to take place from 5.30am on Saturday, June 30th, until Monday, July 2nd. This weekend’s strike, which will affect passengers travelling to mainland Europe, particularly to Nice, Marseilles and Lyon in France, is expected to cause chaos for the many families booked to go on holidays as primary schools close for the summer break. A statement from Ryanair said that as a result of “this unjustified strike action” it had been forced to cancel a number of flights on Saturday and Sunday , adding that all affected customers had been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options.Ryanair customers affected by the cancellations are entitled to a full refund, rebooking on the next available fight or a transfer to an alternative flight. The airline advised passengers to keeping checking the status of their flight ahead of travelling.Ryanair has called for action from the European Commission to prevent more ATC strikes and staff shortages disrupting people’s travel plans over the coming months. It tweeted that this weekend’s industrial action will mark the ninth weekend in the last 13 that French ATC workers have gone on strike.By Friday afternoon Aer Lingus had already cancelled four flights for Saturday and warned of further cancellations and delays over the weekend due to “significant flight disruption” caused by the ATC strike. It advised passengers travelling to European destinations with the airline to check the status of their flight online before leaving for the airport.Aer Lingus is offering affected customers the chance to change their flight to a later date free-of-charge, but warned that due to the busy summer schedule there would be limited availability on many routes. Customers may also request a refund on their flight or to be accommodated on the next available flight. Dublin Airport tweeted that the strike had meant that a number of European flights to and from the airport had been cancelled. “Passengers are advised to check latest flight info with their airline before coming to the airport,” it wrote.For several months, France’s 4,000 air traffic controllers have been engaged in a series of strikes to protest against staff cuts and a lack of up-to-date technology for them, which is blamed on a “lack of investment”.Ryanair warned earlier this month that there would be an airspace “meltdown” unless urgent action was taken to halt the rolling industrial action by French controllers. A report published earlier this month found that between 2004 and 2016 French controllers were on strike for a total of 254 days, far more than the figures for controllers in any other European country. Second were controllers in Greece, with 46 days, followed by Italy, with 37 days, and Germany, with four days."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548680.1530298586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin hose pipe ban could be extended nationwide","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe watering of gardens attached to hotels or other businesses is banned, but garden centres and “visitor” gardens, such at the National Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, are exempt from the ban. Photograph: Getty ImagesBans on watering gardens, washing cars and filling pools from public water supplies could be faced by communities across the country to avoid nationwide droughts, Irish Water has said.The month-long hose pipe ban which comes into force in Dublin on Monday may have to be extended to other areas whose water supplies are at risk, the utility said.More than 100 water schemes around the country have been deemed “at risk” by Irish Water, and all will now be assessed for a possible hose pipe ban.Customers in Kilkenny, Longford, Athlone, north Galway, Louth and Kerry have already experienced restricted water supply and outages in some cases. Areas in Cork, Wicklow, Limerick, Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary, Clare, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Galway, Roscommon, Laois, Limerick, Kerry, Waterford and Offaly have been identified as being at risk.Irish Water has mobilised tankers across the country to fill reservoirs that are most at risk to protect water supplies and ensure customers have access to water. The utility said it was closely monitoring the water supply situation on the Aran Islands, and was ready to ship water to the islands in the coming weeks if necessary. “We are in touch with the farming organisations and offering assistance where water shortage is leading to animal welfare concerns. In critical situations we will accommodate farmers who need to collect water by tanker where it can be made available to meet urgent needs.”The measures in the capital will only apply to domestic water use, with businesses largely escaping the ban.“Irish Water is mindful of the impact that a water conservation order might have on businesses and the tourist industry, and for that reason the prohibition is mainly limited to domestic users with the exception of gardens,” said Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager Kate Gannon.The watering of gardens attached to hotels or other businesses is banned, but garden centres and “visitor” gardens, such at the National Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, are exempt from the ban.Water source levels, especially the main raw water storage facility at Pollaphuca, are dropping at similar rates to previous droughts in 1975, 1976, and 1995. Irish Water can produce 610 million litres of water per day to serve the Dublin area. Last summer an average of 565 million litres of water per day was used. This summer the average has risen to 585 million litres, but by last Monday the levels were at 609 million litres. On Tuesday demand fell to 603 million litres, but the following day shot up to 615 million litres, exceeding the production capacity by 5 million litres. On Thursday usage fell back to 607 million litres, but the recovery was not sufficient to avoid implementing the hose pipe ban, Irish Water said.A similar ban came into force across Northern Ireland on Friday evening for an indefinite period, with its water use running at 25 per cent above normal levels.The Northern Ireland ban covers similar activities to those in the South, but also extends to cleaning windows, walls, paths and patios using a hose."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548712.1530299611!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures to dip but once in a blue moon heatwave to go on","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A man sleeps in the shade in the Phoenix Park in  Dublin.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe .Ireland’s heatwave appears to have reached its peak with temperatures on Friday dropping below the mark of 32 degrees recorded a day earlier.Forecasters believe more hot weather is on the way in a summer now being widely compared to the searing heat of 1976.The highest temperature on Friday, 31.1 degrees, was recorded at Shannon at 4pm, around a degree below where thermometers there peaked on Thursday.More than four decades ago, it lasted, with varying degrees of heat and sunshine, from Easter until the end of August, with temperatures peaking at the end of June.Asked if a repeat of that lengthy summer was on the cards, Mr Eagleton said: “Nobody knows. But today’s the last day of the really mad temperatures.Met Éireann’s definition of a heatwave is five consecutive days of maximum temperatures of 25 degrees and over for a given location.One small corner of Ireland, however, managed to find a cloud. Malin Head in Co Donegal found itself under sea fog and temperatures had not risen above 12 degrees by mid-afternoon.For the rest of the country, a slight dip from the heat of recent days could be welcome.“It’s been an exceptional heatwave that comes to Ireland once in a blue moon, a generational heat wave,” said Mr Eagleton. “Let’s hope it is.”Despite the weather and the public’s enjoyment of it, emergency services have not reported any serious recent incidents.Beaches and seaside towns, particularly in parts of Dublin, have not experienced the kinds of anti-social behaviour or crowd problems that have occurred in recent years.The Coastguard said it had only had to deal with routine incidents on Friday, including offshore pollution reports and coming to the aid of broken down pleasure boats and jet-skis."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Soldiers in uniform will also participate in the LGBT eventLarge gaps and movement found in stairs at 50-year-old block in CoolockRegular pedicures, frozen fruit pops and air conditioning help inhabitants keep their coolFocus Ireland has opened a new Dublin service for families who do not know where they will sleep until late at nightIrish Water assessing more than 100 \u0026lsquoat-risk\u0026rsquo suppliesRapid rise recorded in temperature of the sea and river ShannonEU summit resolves to increase aid to Africa and consider refugee reception centresRepublic is a \u0026lsquosource country\u0026rsquo for sex trafficking and forced labour, report saysMacLochlainn commission finds serious failings in follow-up investigationFormer president to march with son and husband in Dublin Pride event on SaturdayAn Bord Plean\u0026aacutela has granted permission for the planned 138 km north-south connectorForecaster expects \u0026lsquoreally good\u0026rsquo weather in days ahead but mercury unlikely to pass 30 degrees againDiversions in place after van and car collide near Kildimo shortly before 5pm on FridayIt is no surprise that three European leaders took language classes in the State, experts sayCeremony hears call for more work to be done to secure the handing over of institutional records to the State\u0026lsquoNo-one in this country should feel isolated, discriminated against or bullied\u0026rsquoIrish Water assessing more than 100 \u0026lsquoat risk\u0026rsquo supplies around State which may also be affectedKBC claims some \u0026euro2.1m outstanding on loans provided to anti-eviction activistMan moved children from UK to Co Louth after social services ramped up engagement"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548693.1530307940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin zoo staff help animals bear tropical conditions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tYasmina the red panda investigating a refreshing frozen fruit block in Dublin Zoo on Friday afternoon. Photograph: Nick BradshawFruit filled ice-pops, cold showers, air-conditioned rooms, and regular pedicures are part of the treatments for animals at Dublin Zoo during the current heatwave.Gerry Creighton, operations manager of animals and grounds, describes it as “the Hilton Hotel for elephants”.The key to protecting the zoo’s vast range of species from the heat, according to Creighton, who has more than 35 years’ experience, is to provide the animals with “opportunity and choice”.“The weather is great but this spell has been consistently long for us. The biggest success for us for coping with the weather is choice. The animals can go into their air-conditioned houses if they want or they can come outside.”“Nothing is pushed to stay outside in the baking sun. That will always make for happy and healthier animals.”Thankfully, Dublin Zoo is not going to be affected by the possible water shortage, Creighton said. The zoo has three water sources: a well, a lake and back-up water tanks.“We always have a plan B. We know which species are more vulnerable and they’re giving extra time resources and observation. We’ve never lost an animal through adverse weather conditions, hot or cold.”Staff at the zoo are kept busy preparing ice blocks for the animals in a bid to cool them down, though these are not your average Calippo or Loop the Loop.“Ice blocks full of fruit, veg, fish, chicken, meat pieces are given to the animals. We make these massive big blocks for the elephants, about 100 kilos, with pineapples and apples and all different fruits in it. They love it.”Creighton said the role of a modern zoo has changed greatly and there is “no such thing as the wild” anymore.“We have a strong message that we need to give out to the people: it’s not for entertainment. It’s for education and conservation. We’re conserving some of the world’s most endangered species and we’re educating the public.”The zoo emphasises creating a natural habitat for each species, designed specifically for their needs.“It’s like a Garden of Eden. We’ve created a whole beautiful biopark for the city and for Ireland to enjoy. It’s hard to believe you’re a mile from Dublin city centre.”Creighton has worked as a keeper since he was 15 and says there is not a day that he doesn’t look forward to coming into work.“It’s such a lovely environment. You can’t but be inspired by it. You’re so close to nature, you’re so close to some of the most rare and endangered animals in the world.”Dublin Zoo has approximately 200,000 visitors during the summer months."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548428.1530286134!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"head of defence forces to walk in dublin pride parade","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSgt Richard Muldarry after  receiving his Defence Forces Values Champions Award, with his husband, Levino de Oliveira, at The Curragh Camp, Co Kildare.  Members of the Defence Forces are to participate, for the first time in uniform, in Saturday’s Dublin Pride LGBT parade.In a public gesture of support, chief of staff of the Defence Forces Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett and assistant chief of staff Brig-Gen O’Halloran will join the parade and walk with participating members of the forces.The Dublin Pride event starts in St Stephen’s Green at about noon with music and speeches, with the parade proper leaving at 2pm and proceeding along Cuff Street, Kevin Street, Patrick Street, High Street, Church Street, North King Street and ending in Smithfield market.The parade is expected to be particularly exuberant this year, coming as it does in the 25th anniversary year of the decriminalisation of homosexuality and following Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s apology on behalf of the State in the Dáil earlier this month, together with his commitment to expunge the criminal convictions of gay men prosecuted before homosexuality was decriminalised in 1993.For Sgt Richard Muldarry, military participation in the Dublin Pride Parade marks a personal high point. It would not be happening, he says, were it not for “progressive management” in the Defence Forces.Sgt Muldarry is a barrack personnel support service officer at Custume Barracks in Athlone. He has been in the Defence Forces for 19 years and in May received the award for moral courage in the inaugural Defence Forces Values Champions Award.It was given to him in recognition of the work of Defend With Pride, a support network for gay members of the Defence Forces and others in the military who need advice and support on LGBT matters, which Sgt Muldarry founded with other Defence Forces members in 2014.He himself came out in 2004.“I hit my peak of not feeling great about myself,” he says. “I had had girlfriends but at the same time, I had this dark secret inside that was destroying me.”He told family and close friends first, and then his wider circle in the Defence Forces.“I was incredibly lucky,” he says. “I didn’t change – I was the same person I was before I came out.”He says the Defence Forces were “completely supportive” of him and he sees himself as a better soldier and person since.“I was able to excel fully as an inidual and my work grew. Beforehand, I would have been insecure. I gained a lot of respect and I got promoted afterwards as my career has progressed.”Defend With Pride offers advice and support to members of the forces who are gay and open about it, and to others who are perhaps concerned about coming out.There is support also for members who have an issue at home, outside the Defence Forces, but which is impacting on them while serving.Consequently, Sgt Muldarry and his colleagues refer to their group as LGBTA – the “A” standing for “allied”, denoting family and friends. “A lot of soldiers have a gay brother or sister and don’t know where to turn. We are there for them as part of the Defence Forces family.”Sgt Muldarry says the message to anyone anxious about the subject is: “Ask those questions and get the direction and support you need.”He says formal participation by the forces in the Pride parade will send a big signal to wider society.“It’s going to show to everyone that we are a erse organisation and that it is okay to be in the Defence Forces if you are gay, that if we are accepting and you are gay, you should accept yourself as well.”Accepting himself for who he is has brought Sgt Muldarry a large measure of personal happiness. In Dublin in 2013, he met Levino de Oliveira who is from Brazil originally.“I fell for him instantly,” says Sgt Muldarry, “hoping he was gay and, thankfully, he was.”The pair married in 2015 and live in Mullingar.On Saturday, supported by de Oliveira, Sgt Muldarry will walk with pride and he says, “in solidarity with each other, our colleagues, our family and our friends to show Ireland and the world that the Irish Defence Forces truly is a erse and accepting organisation”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548628.1530299553!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"long hot summer ahead as brexit negotiations drag on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron greets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during a breakfast meeting at an EU summit in Brussels, on Friday. Photograph: Virginia MayoPAFor months it was billed as the “Brexit showdown”.The June summit of EU leaders in Brussels was the point at which the UK would have to demonstrate movement on a series of Brexit issues, chief among them the Irish Border.Otherwise, Irish and EU leaders warned, the negotiations would be in trouble. A withdrawal agreement, due to be completed by the autumn, would be in doubt. That meant the transition period sought by the UK – allowing it to ease itself out of the EU after next March, rather than leaving all of a sudden – would become uncertain.Were such a thing to happen it would cause consternation in London, as the UK was brought face-to-face with tumbling out of the EU next March.And yet, the British declined to co-operate. There would be no British proposals on the Border or the future relationship, London made clear, until it was in a position to make them. The UK would not dance to the EU’s tune. It would make its proposals when it was ready to do so. Brexit business continued, but at a snail’s pace.As a group of Irish officials waited for their bags at Brussels airport early on Thursday morning, one senior mandarin who works on Brexit was asked if he was busy these days. “Not really,” was the reply. “I wish I was.”Ireland had wanted to avoid a situation where the Border ended up as one of several issues to be thrashed out at five-to-midnight as deadlines loomed in the autumn. But that’s exactly what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney now face. There’s just no getting away from that.So in recent weeks, the focus of the summit moved to migration into the EU, as a new anti-immigration Italian government found its feet and German chancellor Angela Merkel, still Europe’s most important political leader, came under unprecedented domestic political pressure on the same issue.The switch in focus was evident as the EU leaders arrived for the summit on Thursday, traversing the long red carpet in the Europa building to make their way for a few words with their national media. Few spoke about Brexit. The Irish understand this it’s not clear the British do. Europe is getting over Brexit. They have other things to be getting on with.Going into the summit, one reporter asked the Hungarian prime minister, the authoritarian anti-immigrant Victor Orban, why he persisted in speaking about an “invasion” when there were hardly any migrants coming into Hungary.“Come to the border,” Orban told him.“I went to the border, there is no one there,” the reporter replied.“Because there is a border,” responded Orban.The truth is that Europe’s leaders are having to accommodate themselves to the fact that in many of their countries, there is no support for admitting large numbers of migrants from Africa. They know that if they don’t address the issue, politicians who will address it – one way or another – will be elected. That, more than Brexit, or Trump, or trade, or budgets, is what this summit was about.Meanwhile, the adjacent Justus Lipsius building, where press and officials were gathering, went into temporary lockdown. Access to the building was shut down – nobody in, nobody out. Police clambered down manholes but emerged a few minutes later shrugging and shaking heads.The security alert didn’t keep out the former Ukip leader – and the man who more than anyone else made Brexit a reality – Nigel Farage, who buzzed about from interview to interview in the vast atrium that housed the hundreds of journalists accredited for the summit.For someone who wants to destroy the EU, he seems remarkably addicted to EU summits. The European Parliament, of course, pays his salary.The Irish Border? “It’s the biggest nonsense of all,” he said. “There’s a lot of Euroscepticism in Ireland,” he told Irish reporters. “Always has been, always has been.”And Farage was withering about Varadkar. “The ultimate Yes man in Brussels,” he said. But Farage is a marginal figure these days, even in the UK. His work is done. It’s left to others to pick up the pieces.Two events dominated Thursday night – the EU leaders’ dinner, and the England-Belgium World Cup match. Journalists tried to make the game a metaphor for the summit, or even for the Brexit process, with limited success.More telling perhaps were the photos released from inside the summit room, which showed Belgian prime minister Charles Michel present British prime minister Theresa May with a Belgium jersey.Varadkar donned a Belgium scarf. Everyone was on Belgium’s side. Nobody was cheering for England. British officials later claimed they had a jersey for Michel too, but were ambushed by the Belgians. Nothing seems to be working out as they hoped.When the match starts, the leaders’ dinner is ongoing they won’t be out for many hours yet. The bars around the EU quarter are packed Farage and the Ukip MEPs bray their way to the Place du Luxembourg, but quieten over the evening as England go down to a 1-0 defeat. In the press bar at the summit venue, there is a quiet smattering of applause when the final whistle goes. Perhaps it is because the Belgians are not a passionate nation perhaps everyone realises it will be duller when the English are not around.Before the dinner, there was a brief bilateral meeting involving Varadkar and May. Their personal relations are said to be not good, but officials insist cordiality and business was the order of the day. Varadkar restated his requirements on Brexit May told him proposals are forthcoming. They agreed to resuscitate the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on the North, which the Irish have been seeking for months. Some progress, perhaps, but not on Brexit.At the dinner, meanwhile, things were not going well. The new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conti, attending his first summit after taking power on a pledge to stop the boats packed with African migrants arriving in Italy, blocks agreement on anything until the leaders agree a package of measures to address the migration crisis.This is not how the summits work, council president Donald Tusk explains to him. This is not the procedure. Conti doesn’t care. He is, after all, in government with the Five Star movement, whose slogan is “Vaffanculo!” (“F**k off”).As the session dragged on into the early hours, exasperation with the Italians grew. Conte told the group he was unimpressed at the way it managed its business. He was speaking, he said, as a former lawyer.The Swede Stefan Lofven piped up. He was speaking as a former welder. The Bulgarian Boyko Borissov said he was a former fireman. He is also a former bodyguard, karate coach and footballer. Though he didn’t mention that.At 4.35am, having hammered out a compromise that was half resolution and half aspiration, bleary-eyed EU leaders shuffled out into the Brussels dawn. Borissov said they should establish a trade union to defend their rights not to work extra-long hours.The leaders were whizzed back to their hotels for a few hours’ sleep before Friday’s session started, albeit a few hours late. The young guns – Varadkar, Sebastian Kurz of Austria, Emmanuel Macron, Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg – bounded in the old guard looked less lively. After the tortuous Thursday eveningFriday morning session, nobody was in any mood for hanging around. They rattled through the agenda, including matters related to Brexit. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed the leaders on “some progress on some areas” – but none on others, including the Irish Border.After 2pm, Tusk and commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hosted the end-of-summit press conference with Borissov, marking the end of the six-month Bulgarian presidency.He milked the moment, droning on and on in Bulgarian about the achievements of the presidency. Tusk looked on impassively Juncker looked like a man who needed a gin and tonic. Finally, it was time for questions. The first questioner took the microphone. “What was the biggest achievement of the Bulgarian presidency?”Varadkar held his own press conference. He tried to sound optimistic about Brexit, but failed. The EU seems set to reject the forthcoming British white paper. He told Mrs May, he said, that there was “no point” in putting forward something that was incompatible with single market rules.“While we really regret the fact that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union,” he said, “we’re not going to let them destroy the European Union.” A long hot summer is in store.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneAlthough always pleasant of demeanour, we thought Simon Harris seemed in particularly good spirits this week.And now we know why. The Minister was Health couldn’t help letting colleagues in on the good news at the parliamentary party’s summer night out on Wednesday.His wife, Caoimhe, is expecting their first child and Simon was bursting to tell. “Don’t say it to anyone, it’s supposed to be a secret,” he told half the parliamentary party.Which is the same thing as hiring a plane to fly your message on a banner over Croke Park on All-Ireland final day, only cheaper.Congratulations to the expectant parents. ETA is early in the new year.The news adds an interesting dimension to the Minister for Health’s role in successfully steering the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment. It’s difficult not to wonder what he must have been thinking during the various debates, public meetings and press events on the abortion question, when he was coming to terms with the welcome but anxious early stages of his personal situation.Perhaps it explains why he was so knowledgeable and understanding of issues relating to early pregnancies and pregnant women.It also means that the “I fancy Simon Harris” posters might have to be retired.The Taoiseach was treated to a showing of one of them when he turned up at The Body and Soul festival in the grounds of Ballinlough Castle in Westmeath last weekend.Leo likes his festivals. At one point he was spotted walking barefoot in the grass, which is the thing to do at this happy hippyish annual celebration of the summer solstice.On Saturday afternoon, he was one of the guests in a special edition of The  Women’s\u0026nbspPodcast, where he talked about the recent abortion referendum, among other things. As Kathy Sheridan introduced him and talked about the part he played in bringing about the result, a young woman wearing a bikini jumped up and waved that familiar sign from the day of the count.“Whoever thought Simon Harris could be a sex symbol?” marvelled his boss.He later retreated with friends to the Absolut tent.It’s all go in Leoland.He may have had an early flight to Brussels on Thursday morning, but the Taoiseach was out socialising the night before at his parliamentary party’s summer barbecue in Dicey’s Garden on Harcourt Street.The place was heaving, not least because it’s a hugely popular spot with Dublin’s young Brazilian community. They were in high spirits as their national team clinched its spot in the World Cup knockout stage with a win over Serbia on the night.So the Fine Gaelers cheered on Brazil, christening the place Leo De Janeiro for the occasion.Party chairman Martin Heydon organised the bash to take advantage of the lovely weather and encourage team bonding. However, the latest episode of delaying tactics from opponents of the Road Traffic Bill meant that TDs had to remain on standby in Leinster House as votes were called on various amendments.A slimmed down Noel Rock told colleagues he jogged from the festivities in Harcourt Street to Kildare Street in record time. The TD for Dublin North-West has shed three stone in his local Flyefit gym in Drumcondra since beginning his new regime of “gymwork and a bit of a diet” in January.Back in Dicey’s, fiscal prudence was the order of the day for chairman Heydon, who put money behind the bar for the troops. He chose a pub where the pints cost €1.50 all night – which is the main reason the Brazilians love the place.(Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party, by the way, is having its summer soiree next week. Clare TD Timmy Dooley is in charge of selecting the venue but hasn’t told anyone where it is yet.)The Taoiseach didn’t hang around for too long at the barbecue, but his Minister for Europe, Helen McEntee, led a large posse of TDs and Senators to the adjacent Copper Face Jacks. McEntee was also on Leo’s early flight to Brussels, looking fresh as a daisy at their press briefing later in the day.Leo did the diplomatic thing at the summit when asked what team he would be supporting in Thursday night’s clash between Belgium and England. He said that as he was in Belgium, he would cheer for the home team. However, he pointed out that if Belgium won, England would “probably get an easier ride in the next round so perhaps it is one of those win-win scenarios”.He wore a Belgian scarf which European commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker (fresh from his Dublin visit last week which he seems to have thoroughly enjoyed) placed around his neck after the country’s prime minister, Charles Michel, handed out some Red Devils merchandise before the meeting.He managed to get the British prime minister to pose with a Belgium football shirt, which had number 10 on the back along with the name of their top attacker, “Hazard”.Theresa May took it well. But, rather like her long-awaited Brexit White Paper, she didn’t produce an England white jersey in return.At the beginning of this week’s Cabinet meeting, just before Ministers got down to business, Paschal Donohoe had a small request to make of one of his colleagues.He turned to Josepha Madigan, the Minister for Culture. “Josepha, will you be hearing confessions today?”But not as much as the comment from the Minister for Justice, who was at the receiving end of compliments from the Taoiseach for his sure-footed handling of a number of recent projects. There was applause from colleagues.But Charlie Flanagan wasn’t getting carried away by all the praise.“Thank you. But I will not rest until Stepaside Garda station is reopened,” was his po-faced reply.Everyone cracked up. Everyone, that is, except for the Minister for Transport, Shane Ross, aka Winston Churchtown. Winston has hitched his reputation to the reopening of the station, and has announced a number of false dawns in this regard.No. He didn’t laugh at all.Two tweets caught our eye this week.The first, courtesy of senior counsel Bernard Dunleavy, provided incontrovertible proof that we are in the middle of a heatwave. He posted a photo of a notice outside the Barristers’ Tea Room Restaurant in the Four Courts headed “Warm Weather Warning”.“During the current Status Yellow hot weather warning, the chairman has agreed that should members wish.... Jackets may be removed here in the Barristers’ Tea Room.”However, lest people fear the chairman of the Bar Council has taken leave of his senses in the heat, it says in small letters at the bottom of the notice: “As per the HSE recommendation.”And the second was fired off on Wednesday by former Fine Gael minister for justice Alan Shatter who is not at all impressed by Ross’s judicial appointments crusade.“Bombast \u0026amp fakery is no substitute for analysis \u0026amp facts. Shane Ross should stop muttering behind my back \u0026amp playing the role of Trump Lite denigrating judges \u0026amp lawyers. I challenge him to directly debate with me his crazy Judicial Apntmnts Bill. Enough of the cowardice! Woof!”Easy there, Alan. Let the dog see the rabbit.So what about it, Winston Churchtown? Are you brave enough to accept Alan’s challenge?What TD entered Leinster House for the first time 37 years after his election?The answer is Paddy Agnew, who was elected to Dáil Éireann as an anti-H-Block candidate in 1981. He never entered the Dáil and held the seat until the following year’s general election. As an IRA prisoner he topped the poll in Louth, elected on the same day as Kieran Doherty, who won a seat in Cavan-Monaghan and died on hunger strike in Long Kesh two months later.Agnew joined Sinn Féin in Dundalk on his release from prison in 1986.He was invited to the Dáil by former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams and given “a special welcome” by leader Mary Lou McDonald, who told the chamber: “This is the first time that he has actually been in Leinster House, so I am sure everybody will extend a warm welcome to him.”After the Sinn Féin TDs burst into applause, Mary Lou looked up to the public gallery where the former TD was sitting with his wife, Catherine. “We are delighted you’re here, Paddy. It took you a while but you got here in the end. Good man.”Later in the proceedings, there was more applause – this time from all sides – when the Ceann Comhairle welcomed him to the Dáil.Afterwards in the Sinn Féin party rooms, Mary Lou presented her honoured guest with the formal framed statement from the returning officer of his election to the Dáil and gave Catherine a framed copy of the issue of An Phoblacht which announced Paddy and Ciarán Doherty’s election as TDs.Line of the week: This is from Michael Collins, member of the Rural Independents Group and TD for Cork South-West. Michael is one of the TDs trying to delay the passage of Shane Ross’s controversial Road Traffic Bill, which will introduce harsher drink-driving penalties and put learners who drive unaccompanied off the road.Here’s Collins, protesting to a very fed-up Leas Cheann Comhairle: “I have not yet had the opportunity to be repetitious.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548716.1530311785!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar urged to take hard line with fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome Ministers believe Fine Gael can gain between seven and 13 seats in the next general election The dispute between the two parties continued on Friday, with three senior Ministers criticising Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin for his comments on when the deal between the two parties should be renegotiated.Mr Martin has insisted Mr Varadkar is seeking to provoke Fianna Fáil into an early general election, and stressed his belief that talks should begin at the end of the current arrangement.However, speaking in Brussels on Friday, Mr Varadkar said the Opposition party needed to make clear its intentions in the near future.“We really need to know from them, sooner rather than later, whether they’re committed to the confidence and supply agreement long term or not, because it’s not possible to govern in the interests of the people, to do our jobs as Ministers if we don’t know week to week, month to month whether the Government is going to survive or not,” said Mr Varadkar.The dispute between both parties has heightened the possibility of an early general election, and senior Government sources say Mr Varadkar is eager to have one this year. The Taoiseach believes there needs to be clarity on the stability of the Government ahead of the budget and the Brexit negotiations, sources added. Mr Varadkar is understood to be focused on candidate selection at present, and on attracting people from outside Fine Gael into the party fold. This position is supported by a number of Ministers, who believe Fine Gael can gain between seven and 13 seats in the next election.The current arrangement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael expires later this year, and there is a commitment to review the deal at that juncture.Minister for Health Simon Harris said he believed the talks on renewal should begin before the budget, while Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan called on Fianna Fáil to explain why it wants to “plunge the country into an unwanted general election and likely instability and uncertainty that will ensue”.Meanwhile, the Independent Alliance and Minister for Children Katherine Zappone backed Fianna Fáil’s position in the dispute. Mr Martin has said talks on the deal should take place after the budget and at the end of the arrangement.Minister for Transport Shane Ross, Minister with special responsibility for Disability Finian McGrath, Ministers of State John Halligan and Kevin Boxer Moran and Ms Zappone said they believed it was essential the third budget was passed. Ms Zappone told reporters she did not know if the Government would survive beyond the confidence and supply arrangement, but did not believe there would be a “break up” before the budget.In a statement, the Independent Alliance said the talk of an election in the autumn was unhelpful and could derail the Brexit negotiations.A spokesman added: “The last thing that the people want to see is another period of political instability, and the Independent Alliance supports the comments of Mr Martin who is seeking to reach agreement on a third budget and possibly extend the confidence and supply agreement beyond that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest recognises spectacular photos taken within the last two years, with entries in three categories: Nature, People and Cities. REIKO TAKAHASHI - National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest - Mermaid I was fortunate to have encountered a humpback whale with her calf on my first day snorkeling near Japan’s Kumejima Island.

It also argued that Sopel, as North America editor, appeared in more peaktime bulletins.Gracie accepted the China job in 2014 on a salary of £130,000. When the BBC was forced to publish the salaries of its highest-paid presenters last year, Gracie was shocked to discover that Sopel was in the £200,000-249,999 bracket.After a six-month fight, she has now won her case. Gracie is donating the money to the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for women’s rights.In a statement, the BBC said: “The BBC acknowledges that Carrie was told she would be paid in line with the North America Editor when she took the role of China Editor, and she accepted the role on that understanding.“The BBC is committed to the principle of equal pay and acting in accordance with our values. The BBC acknowledges the specific circumstances relating to Carrie’s appointment, apologises for underpaying Carrie, and has now put this right.”The statement added: “Carrie has made, and will continue to make, an important contribution to the BBC. During her tenure as China Editor, Carrie delivered reports, analysis and work that were as valuable as those of the other International Editors in the same period.”Gracie said: “I am glad to have been able to resolve this with the Director-General - it shows that we can make progress. I’m also pleased that my work as China Editor has now been properly recognised by the BBC and relieved that this difficult period is over.Ballsy BBC Women who have hit back over the gender pay gap row“For me, this was always about the principle, rather than the money. I’m delighted to donate all the backdated pay from the BBC to help women striving for equality at work.”Speaking outside Broadcasting House, she described the BBC as her work family and said: “Sometimes families feel the need to shout at each other but it’s always a relief when you can stop shouting.”Neither side confirmed the back pay figure, but it is understood to be in the region of £280,000, based on the discrepancy in Gracie’s and Sopel’s salaries in the three-and-a-half years that they overlapped in international editor roles.Gracie will now take six months of unpaid leave to write and speak on both China and gender equality.She quit her job as China editor in January with a public letter of resignation, and female colleagues at the BBC rallied round to show their support for her.The BBC’s head of news, Fran Unsworth, was called before a parliamentary select committee, where she attempted to defend the pay discrepancy between Gracie and Sopel.Sopel has since agreed to take a salary cut in order to close the gender pay gap.Please review our commenting policySyrian girl pictured using tin cans as prosthetic legs finds hope in TurkeySuspected smuggler arrested at Heathrow with two vulture chicks hidden in a secret beltLove Island, week 4 recap: a lesson in what happens when you get all your culture from advertisingMilitary covenant at risk from pay cap and \u0026#39lamentable\u0026#39 accommodation provision Outnumbered parents \u0026#39together in real-life romance\u0026#39Exclusive: Franco-Dutch company set to produce British passports hamstrung by delays and legal challenges in Norway and SwedenChildren spend up to 10 hours a day \u0026#39mindlessly swiping\u0026#39 their mobiles, study findsRural communities risk being left behind by fibre rollout Public sector bosses are on a \u0026#39gilded staircase\u0026#39 of huge pay rises they do not deserve, MPs warnBT should be broken up because ownership of broadband network is harming consumers, minister saysUniversities may be fuelling the mental health crisis, leading psychiatrist warns Britain facing shortage of meat and other foods amid CO2 crisis England team needs more female fans, deputy ambassador says as she laments lack of support in RussiaTens of thousands of pensioners face cuts to income after huge HMRC trawl identifies decades of errorsInside Theresa May and Donald Trump\u0026#39s not-so-special relationship...

It feels compulsive. It’s very visual. It’s quite shocking because it is very superficial,” said Damon de Ionno, managing director of Revealing Reality, which advises and researches for the regulator Ofcom, England’s children’s commissioner and the BBC.When the researchers played back the on-screen records to show the young people what they had been doing on their phones, the teenagers went into denial. “They said things like ‘Oh, it’s not normally this boring,’ as if seeing it properly for the first time,” said Mr de Ionno.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreAlthough children from lower income households were potentially more prone to such passive consumption of social media, he said: “We are seeing more and more relatively highly-educated girls from good backgrounds who are spending this sort of time on screen.”Olympia, who was revising for her A-levels during the study, told the researchers the only place she could relax was in the bath because she could not take in her phone – although she added she would take it in if it was water-proof.The consequences were that they missed out on not only other activities – whether sporting or educational – but also face-to-face communication by conducting relationships almost entirely through instant messaging or emojis.“It is a dumbed down way to communicate with someone but it is a function of the smart phone because it’s hard to write prose that says what you mean on such a device. It’s easier to press a like button or send an emoji,” said Mr de Ionno.Duty of care puffThe research warned of a potential link to increasing youth mental ill health and addiction. And it criticised social media firms for drawing in younger children through game-like elements like Snapchat ‘streaks’ which encourage them to update friendships on a daily basis, and filters, where they can add cartoon images to their pictures.In their study, one child had been online every day for more than two years to maintain an 800-day Snapchat streak with a friend. “Snapstreaks effectively turn social interactions into a game, they keep you on the app,” said Mr de Ionno.“People need to reassess their relationship with smart phones otherwise it can become all-consuming where the world and all relationships are seen only through the phone.”As a result of the study, one of the research team’s youngest members, a school-leaver, was so shocked by what he saw that he deleted all his social profiles apart from two messaging apps.Duty of Care CampaignPlease review our commenting policySyrian girl pictured using tin cans as prosthetic legs finds hope in TurkeySuspected smuggler arrested at Heathrow with two vulture chicks hidden in a secret beltLove Island, week 4 recap: a lesson in what happens when you get all your culture from advertisingMilitary covenant at risk from pay cap and \u0026#39lamentable\u0026#39 accommodation provision Outnumbered parents \u0026#39together in real-life romance\u0026#39Exclusive: Franco-Dutch company set to produce British passports hamstrung by delays and legal challenges in Norway and SwedenPublic sector bosses are on a \u0026#39gilded staircase\u0026#39 of huge pay rises they do not deserve, MPs warnBT should be broken up because ownership of broadband network is harming consumers, minister saysRural communities risk being left behind by fibre rollout Tens of thousands of pensioners face cuts to income after huge HMRC trawl identifies decades of errorsUniversities may be fuelling the mental health crisis, leading psychiatrist warns Britain facing shortage of meat and other foods amid CO2 crisis England team needs more female fans, deputy ambassador says as she laments lack of support in RussiaInside Theresa May and Donald Trump\u0026#39s not-so-special relationship...

And I thought when I looked at the Panama fans how many women and even children were there.”Skoll  said there were colleagues in the Foreign Office who were \u0026#34horrified and bemused as to why a woman who knew nothing about football was going to be spearheading the Russian network effort on the World Cup”Ms Skoll, the most senior official responsible for looking after English fans during the tournament, added: “You realise that in England football is still very much a male pursuit and I thought that is quite sad. At no point did I feel endangered it was just brilliant.“All the male fans I have met have been universally charming, polite, really inclusive, delighted to see us. I wouldn’t want to say it’s a macho negative thing.  I still think it’s a legacy of the 80s and 90s in English football. I would love to see more women and families because for me that would show that English football has transformed into something beyond those really dark days.”Ms Skoll only took up her post in January, with responsibilities that included heading up the World Cup diplomatic team. Just two months later, relations with the Kremlin plunged to a new low after the nerve agent attack on the Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. Britain barred all dignitaries - including ministers and members of the Royal Family - from attending the World Cup, leaving Ms Skoll as the senior UK representative at the games.“It has been a baptism of fire,” she told The , praising her team of about a hundred officials for ensuring the tournament has run smoothly for England’s fans. The World Cup has seen England supporters warmly embraced by ordinary Russians but Ms Skoll is in no doubt that nobody should be fooled and that once the tournament is over, the problems caused by Vladimir Putin - that include chemical weapons attacks in Syria and the invasion of Ukraine - will not have gone away.“I have to be really clear the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury was outrageous and that has badly damaged our bilateral relationship and you can’t get around that,” she said.But the diplomat, with a degree in history and Russian and whose previous post was High Commissioner to the Seychelles, believes that the legacy of this World Cup will be for Russia to wake up and become “a more open, tolerant and erse society”. Looking beyond Putin’s rule, she hoped “the next generation of Russian leaders” will use the football tournament as a platform for change.“I am not naive. I don’t think transformation will occur overnight but I would like to think that the celebration of a sport like football has to have some lasting effect here,” she said, adding: “Moscow has been transformed and it’s not easy to put the genie back in the bottle. It is an infectious thing and it has ignited something in Russia that is powerful in a social and cultural way.”Ms Skoll, the most senior official responsible for looking after English fans during the tournament, added: “You realise that in England football is still very much a male pursuit and I thought that is quite sad\u0026#34 Ms Skoll, a self confessed rugby fan, has loved every minute of the tournament, impressed by the fans’ behaviour and charmed by England’s footballers. She met the players at an open training session along with 30 children the British embassy sponsors through its charity work in Russia.“There are a lot of colleagues in the Foreign Office who were horrified and bemused as to why a woman who knew nothing about football was going to be spearheading the Russian network effort on the World Cup,” she said.Ms Skoll will attend the last 16 knockout game against Colombia, the biggest match played by England since 2006. About 10,000 fans are expected to pour into Moscow, five times the numbers that watched the opening game in Volgograd.Fans have their own favourites and Ms Skoll, a mother to one daughter and two stepchildren, is no different. She adores harry Maguire, the England defender. “I love Harry maguire,” she said, “There is something about him. There’s something a bit boyish. He was absolutely charming when I met him. He gets on the pitch and he’s sensational,” she said, a smile broadening across her face.Syrian girl pictured using tin cans as prosthetic legs finds hope in TurkeySuspected smuggler arrested at Heathrow with two vulture chicks hidden in a secret beltLove Island, week 4 recap: a lesson in what happens when you get all your culture from advertisingMilitary covenant at risk from pay cap and \u0026#39lamentable\u0026#39 accommodation provision Outnumbered parents \u0026#39together in real-life romance\u0026#39Exclusive: Franco-Dutch company set to produce British passports hamstrung by delays and legal challenges in Norway and SwedenChildren spend up to 10 hours a day \u0026#39mindlessly swiping\u0026#39 their mobiles, study findsRural communities risk being left behind by fibre rollout Public sector bosses are on a \u0026#39gilded staircase\u0026#39 of huge pay rises they do not deserve, MPs warnBT should be broken up because ownership of broadband network is harming consumers, minister saysUniversities may be fuelling the mental health crisis, leading psychiatrist warns Britain facing shortage of meat and other foods amid CO2 crisis Tens of thousands of pensioners face cuts to income after huge HMRC trawl identifies decades of errorsInside Theresa May and Donald Trump\u0026#39s not-so-special relationship...

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Usually after brushing his teeth. Or when stopping by the bathroom, or anywhere with a mirror.He hooks an index finger into each side of his mouth and pulls gently upward. He puckers his face into a kiss, then opens wide into an O, trying to limber up his facial muscles. He practises both the Mona Lisa – slight, closed-lip – and a wide, toothy smile.At least, he’s supposed to do his exercises every day. Being 13, he sometimes forgets, though he understands their importance.“I need to stretch my cheeks,” he says. “I do it for a couple minutes. I have to do it every single day.” He exercises so much that his jaw sometimes hurts. \u0026nbspDavid and Victoria Beckham smile in \u0027amazing\u0027 family night picture How to get white teeth: Four top tips to achieve a brighter smileMan smiles before lethal injection for murder of two young daughtersKevin was born in New Jersey with a rare malignant vascular tumour, a kaposiform haemangioendothelioma, covering the left side of his face, squeezing shut his left eye and pushing his nose to the right. Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia.

The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers.

Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some called her a “traitor”.In her separate letter, calling the crisis meeting for 28 July, the MP pointed out that she had been praised by some cabinet ministers for her “courage” in fighting a hard Brexit.“I will continue to support the Prime Minister towards this soft Brexit.

He added that “time is very short” and said UK negotiators should return to Brussels on Monday to intensify talks.The EU says a deal must be struck before October to stop Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a transition period – a scenario that would be expected to cause economic chaos.Theresa May on Thursday night addressed leaders over dinner about Brexit for 10 minutes but her speech was apparently overshadowed by hours of discussions about the EU migration crisis, the main focus of the summit.\u0026nbspdidn’t realise Theresa May had made a speech in BrusselsAsked about Ms May’s dinner speech on Friday morning, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, looked confused, and said: “There was a speech? Haha.”The joint statement signed off by the leaders on Friday, which was leaked to The Independent in advance, said coming to a deal “requires further clarity as well as realistic and workable proposals from the UK”.“The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland,” it read.“It recalls the commitments undertaken by the UK in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018, and insists on the need for intensified efforts so that the Withdrawal Agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal.\u0026nbsp“It recalls that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.”The motion says that the Council urges “member states, Union institutions and all stakeholders to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes” – diplomatic reference to a “no-deal”\u0026nbspscenario.\u0026nbspThe main sticking point in talks is how to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The UK has flat-out rejected EU plans to give a special status to Northern Ireland that would effectively keep it in the customs union and single market, and says any deal must apply to the whole UK and be time limited. The EU says UK plans so far are not enough to prevent a hard border from happening.The UK also wants to time-limit the policy to placate Brexiteers who fear it could be used to keep Britain in the single market indefinitely, but the EU says it would not accept this.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

He called all this on, where is he? In Europe, in Nice, with his trotters up, where is the geezer? I think he should be held to account for it.”Mr Corbyn, who insisted he voted to remain in the EU, later managed to contribute to the debate by saying: “The government who is meant to be negotiating spends its time negotiating with itself.

Since the war broke out in 2015\u0026nbspmore than 22 million people have become\u0026nbspdependent on aid to survive, and around eight million of that figure live on the brink of famine.\u0026nbspCivil society has collapsed, with of doctors\u0026nbspand teachers going\u0026nbspunpaid, and the country is in the grip\u0026nbspof the worst\u0026nbspcholera epidemic in modern history.\u0026nbspAn estimated 80 per cent of the country’s food, medicine and other imports flows through Hodeidah, leaving aid agencies sounding the alarm that any damage or hold up in the flow of goods could push Yemen into total collapse.\u0026nbspThe Arab coalition fighting to regain control of Yemen – led by the exiled government, Saudi Arabia and UAE – launched a massive operation to retake the city earlier this month, which it hopes will clear a path to driving rebels out of the capital, Sanaa, and end the stalemate in the three-year-old war.\u0026nbspSky News Arabia reported late on Wednesday night that Yemeni president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi rejected the second of two offers from Houthi rebels, which would allow the Iran-backed forces to remain there\u0026nbspbut under UN supervision.\u0026nbsp“Houthis not treated like any other terrorist militia and\u0026nbsphave dialogue with UN and\u0026nbspopportunity to negotiate political process.

Key MEP warns \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo chances RISING as Brexit deadline approachesMr\u0026nbspLongworth pointed out that Airbus is mostly owned by the French and German governments who are bent on ensuring that Brexit is not a success.He said: \u0026ldquoThis is classic of a foreign multinational that clearly cares less about the UK but is trying to dictate our future. Airbus is intrinsically wrapped up in the EU.Two major shareholders are the German and French governments.

However the far north and some North Sea coasts will be cooler and a little cloudier at times.Saturday to Monday - Fine for many with warm sunshine. However, misty around east coasts to start with and often cloudier in parts of Scotland. Becoming more humid with time in the south. Humid in the south west Sunday and Monday, with a risk of thunderstorms.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, and across the globe. Pourquoi? (That means “why” and is usually accompanied by a shrug and slightly hysterical hand gestures.)Fewer and fewer British kids are learning French in school. The number studying this absurd language has dropped by 30,000 in the past seven years. Instead, our children are learning languages which might actually prove to be useful later on in life.French is useful only if you visit France — and even then they’ll pretend not to understand you.Oh, and a small bunch of arid and desolate African countries which — trust me on this — you are never going to visit. Unless you want a dose of the Ebola virus or your head chopped off. French does not make the top ten of languages spoken worldwide.It only just crawls into the top 20 — between Marathi and Korean, since you asked. Marathi is spoken by some people in India. Not a huge amount of people, frankly. Nice people though, I’m sure.The Africans have learned the utter uselessness of French.In the past few years two countries from that continent have ditched French as the second language and replaced it with — of course — English. That’s Rwanda and Gabon. The switch has proved very popular indeed. More countries are set to follow suit.Do you know where else they don’t speak French any more? France. Well, in French universities. Science subjects such as physics and maths are taught in English.This is because foreign students coming to France don’t want to have to encumber themselves by learning a new language which will be of less use to them later than Swahili or Gaelic.This has been too long in coming. Right now, more and more British schools are switching to Spanish.This makes sense because while 437million people in the world speak Spanish as a first language — i.e. Spain, Central and most of South America — only about 75million speak French.That’s France, half of Belgium and about nine people in Switzerland.But never mind Spanish, important though it is. Foreign languages are too often neglected by British students.And yet we need them to compete in the world. English is the international language of commerce and culture, sure.I would make it compulsory for kids to learn Mandarin from the age of five. And as a second choice, Spanish — which we’re getting good at — or Arabic.Hell, we could do with knowing what that lot are up to. Our security services have struggled because too few English people have any knowledge of Arabic.And how about Russian?We need a bit of a revolution in the way we teach foreign languages here.For too long we have glided by thinking we need to learn nothing. Just a verse or two of Frere Jacques, that’ll do.But the world is changing and our schools need to change with it.Right now they are beginning to do so, but too slowly.Get the kids learning stuff which will help them compete in the world. And shove French in the trash can of history.Ding dang dong, indeed.THE wags seem to have had a nice night out in St Petersburg.Good for them.I do miss Abbey Clancy from the line-up, though.I suppose it would be a bit much to put Peter Crouch up front just so we got a chance to see her again.JUST as the England team looks like it’s going places and everyone’s happy, there’s a beer shortage.This is because of a national shortage of carbon dioxide.How the hell can we have a shortage of THAT?Your average human breathes out almost three pounds of the stuff every day.This is a national crisis and I think I have the answer.We need to get some people who are of no other use to the world to sit in vast vats of flat lager, belching continuously.Diane Abbott, for example.Humans involved in strenuous exercise exhale even more CO2 – maybe 12 pounds a day. So, Diane, on a treadmill, in a vast vat of lager, belching continuously. Yum.SO, the adolescent, unemployable liberal scumbags are still trying to get Donald Trump’s visit to the UK cancelled.Lefties who cannot bear to hear people express different views to their own will be staging infantile protests across London.There are even plans to have a giant blimp of the US president flying across the capital.A typically nasty and childish little prank by people who cannot abide democracy.And who do not care that the US is our major ally – and especially important once we have left the European Union.The protests are being supported by such organisations as ActionAid, which calls itself a charity.Make sure you never give those people any of your money.And one more thing, you protestors. You think Trump is only in power for four years? Think again. He will win again.Just as other populists are winning elections across Europe.The liberals have lost the argument and they are losing at the polls.NOTHING has given me as much pleasure during the World Cup as watching that fat, cheating coke-head Diego Maradona being hauled out of his seat, drunk out of his skull and incapable of standing.Hand of God – yeah. And the septum of Danniella Westbrook.The only downside was that the Argies won their game against Nigeria, undeservedly. They now face France in the next round.Argentina versus France. Like deciding who you want to win in a fist fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Clegg. You kind of hope they’ll annihilate each other and no team goes through.It’s been a great World Cup so far, and very well run by the Russians. Best teams? Croatia, certainly. But England are still in the chasing pack.And how very sad to wave goodbye to the Germans. Cheerio! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Who would have thought?Did he mention that Airbus, who have been warning of plague and pestilence if we dare to leave, have just been found to have received illegal subsidies worth £17billion from . . . the EU?Did he tell his audience that even Financial Times bosses — a paper so comfortable in Brussels’ bosom it could redesign its masthead as a blue-and-yellow brassiere — think German car manufacturers need a UK trade deal, regardless of what BMW say? Did he heck.Big businesses have done very well out of the EU for years. They’ll resist every possible attempt to reform it or improve it and in Greg Clark they’ve got a man unimaginative enough to believe everything they say.There are plenty of other businesses who are looking to the future with confidence and are excited about Britain striking out on their own.And those outfits who are complaining about Brexit will adjust, just as they did when we (thankfully) didn’t join the Euro, because we’ve got the fifth largest economy in the world and they’d be mad to turn their back on us.It’s time the PM backed Brexit voters over corporate doom-mongers.LOVE Island’s Adam is a nasty piece of work.How ITV can justify him still being on the show despite being caught sending sleazy messages to a 17-year-old girl is beyond us.People have been thrown off for much less. ITV’s shameless pursuit of ratings can’t justify him still being there.Boot him.VAR has made the World Cup a much better experience.Rather than arguing about decisions in the pub for years afterward, they get sorted out straight away.Yes, there are niggles. But between Neymar’s ludicrous dive and South Korea’s (wonderful) goal, more ­decisions are right than ever before.Dinosaur Premier League bosses should introduce it next season.The only downside is that it might have ruled out Geoff Hurst’s goal in ’66.But today’s probably painful enough for our German friends...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last time we had a summer like this 1976.”She attributed the dangerously high pollen counts to the rainfall in spring that helped grass to grow – with the pollen now released thanks to the warm temperatures.Dr Emberlin warned the stretch of days with a high pollen count could be making it worse for sufferers.She said: “What tends to happen is that people become more sensitive as the season goes on, unless they have controlled their symptoms.“They may develop more symptoms over five to seven days, including getting tired and head aches because of hay fever.”The sneezy season comes as temperatures continue to rise 10C above average - with the weekend again expected to see temperatures in the high 20s and conditions to remain dry and sunny.The Met Offices Ms Chivers said there was an extremely small chance of showers across the south east.She added: We have a very large, high pressure system over the top of us and that means dry weather and cloudless skies.It looks like its going to carry on into next week - theres no end in sight.This week has seen records tumble, with four days crowned the hottest day of the year.Highs were recorded across the UK -  making it the first time in five years that temperatures have hit 30C in all four nations of the UK.The hottest temperatures recorded were 33C in Porthmadog, Wales.But the heatwave has sparked health warnings with conditions expected to remain hot and sunny over the weekend.The Met Offices heat-health watch alert remains at level two, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.Authorities have also issued warnings to cut shower times down to just four minutes as temperatures continue to sizzle.With no rain on the horizon, the South East is set for its driest June since records began.The heat has caused havoc for commuters after rail services imposed speed limits on trains due to overheating tracks caused by the steel on tracks to expand and sometimes buckle.South Western Railway said temperatures were expected to reach 47C on many parts of its route this week.The heatwave could even top a blistering 38C in the coming months, raising fears this summer could be even worse than the Lucifer heatwave last year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000407549635.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry meghan markle honeymoon rumours namibia","story":"The couple had been tipped to travel to Namibia thanks to the 33-year-old royals strong ties to southwest Africa.But Prince Harry put the rumour to bed during a chat with Mavis Elias, a philanthropist from Namibia, at the Queens Young Leaders Awards Ceremony on Tuesday, The Mirror reported.The Love Is Charity founder asked Harry if he visited her home country and he responded: No, we didnt go to Namibia.And the royal seemed keen to keep the real destination under wraps.Gesturing to listening media as he added: Im not going to say where.Namibia had been hotly tipped as a possible honeymoon destination for the couple.Harry and Meghan had been expected to stay at the Hoanib Valley Camp in Kaokoland for the romantic getaway after marrying at St Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle.Harry is a big fan of the country - after spending time there with ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy in 2006, as part of the Army in 2008 and working on conservation projects in 2015.And he also spent a significant length of time in neighbouring Botswana with Meghan, with the couple even celebrating Prince Harrys birthday there.The Sun revealed last year that the couple actually decided to wed while on the romantic holiday in Botswana in 2017.The loved-up pair committed to marriage when they were camping under the stars in the African wilderness, just a year after they started dating.For Meghans first ever safari, the pair stayed in a luxurious tented bush camp at Meno a Kwena, boasting incredible views over the Boteti River and African bush.Harry later said of the trip: Going on holiday together in the middle of nowhere and sharing a tent together and all that kind of stuff.It was fantastic.Harry even sourced the main stone in the engagement ring he gave to Meghan from Botswana, which is one of the world’s most renowned places for diamond mining.The couple may well have still travelled to another part of Africa for their honeymoon.Prince Harry has previously revealed his affinity with Africa - even missing his niece Princess Charlottes christening in order to help with anti-poaching efforts in Namibia.While on his trip he slept outside in the bush, telling one of his colleagues: Ive come all the way to Africa to be free.

on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.The Met Offices heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.Public Health England issued a warning saying the extreme heat may pose a risk to the most vulnerable.The pollen count is also expected to soar this weekend.More than half of the UK is expected to be hit with very high levels of grass pollen.The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires.The heat has already claimed casualties.Thirteen-year-old Ryan Evans tragically drowned while swimming at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, with it taking divers two days to find the youngsters body.A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.The RSPCA called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars.The hot spell is good news for gardeners, with horticultural experts saying it could help produce excellent vegetables, fruit and flowers.The Royal Horticultural Society have suggested people use waste water from the kitchen to keep plants nourished and to reduce demand for water."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416867276.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may says danny dyer is perfectly entitled to call david cameron a tt and refuses to stand up for ex pm","story":"The PM defended the actors right to call David Cameron a t**t -

No ones got a f**king clue what Brexit is.Its like this mad riddle that no one knows what it is. So whats happened to that t**t David Cameron who called it on?He called all this on, where is he?

Coastal District Council in January shortly after proposing to long-term girlfriend Cherry Seaborn, 26.The singer said the chapel was needed because it is every persons right to be able to have a place of retreat for contemplation and prayer, for religious observance, celebration of key life and family milestones, marriages, christenings and so forth.But planning officials said the chapel would conflict with prevailing character of the landscape.Sheerans planning agent Paul Smith said such claims were not based on facts and discredit the high-quality architecture.Mr Smith, from Apex Planning Consultants, insisted the chapel would have been sited on private land, at least 230m from the road.He added: We do not agree that at such distance from public land and views, it will generate the attention he (the objector) purports.After The Suffolk Wildlife Trust raised concerns about a colony of endangered Great Crested Newts on the land, Sheeran pledged to carry out an ecological survey.It is not known what plans Mr Sheeran will now have for his wedding.A spokesman for Suffolk Coastal District Council said: It [the chapel] would be out of character for the rural

even at the age of 92","story":"So we shouldn’t be surprised that she had to cancel a service at St Paul’s Cathedral this week because she was feeling a bit “under the weather”.The Queen’s definition of that anodyne phrase is most likely an ailment that would have left the rest of us in hospital.She reminds me of those “stuff and nonsense” posh countrywomen in French And Saunders who would accidentally cut their fingers off and nonchalantly throw them to the dogs.There must, however, have been more to it than Her Maj not ­feeling too chipper, as she hates to miss any special church services, and especially one which marked the 200th anniversary of the Order of Michael and St George.While that might not mean very much to you and me, it’s the kind of historical royal traditional the Queen holds so very dear.Those attending had to make do with Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, being honoured for her international charity work.I’m sure Angelina would have been horribly disappointed not to receive her gong from the Queen, but from last-minute substitute the Duke of Kent.Even A-listers are in awe of our monarch.But maybe her absence from events is something we will all have to get more used to.She has already stepped down from overseas visits, leaving the long-haul flights to younger members of The Firm.Indeed, we’ve just seen Prince William deftly tip-toe through political minefields in the Middle East.And I’m sure Meghan and Harry will have started packing for an upcoming visit to Australia and New Zealand.The Queen, will obviously still be on hand to give wise counsel to her children and grand children, but with Prince Philip retired from public life, who could blame her for taking things a little bit easier.Her schedule is relentless.Earlier in the week she was working as usual, with duties including an audience with the ambassador of Zimbabwe.Next week she will be at Holyrood Palace, in ­Edinburgh, with a busy schedule of events including investitures where she will, among others, be honouring my friend and colleague Ross King with an MBE.At these ceremonies the Queen is on her feet for hours, dealing with nervous, excited people including those like myself, who are so overcome they just blub and burble incoherently.To this day I have no idea what the Queen said to me when I received my OBE in Holyrood, because I was so overcome by the whole experience.Even those who profess to find the Royal Family archaic and irrelevant would have to admit the Queen deserves respect for her work ethic and sense of duty. Despite being in her nineties, she has kept her finger on the nation’s pulse and apart from the blip immediately after Diana’s death, she knows what the people expect of her.That’s why I don’t think we will ever see her completely retire.She keeps a beady eye on the other royals and I reckon she will take a very dim view of this week’s revelations that Prince Charles ran up a £1million bill jetting around in the past financial year.The Queen switches off the lights in Buckingham Palace, keeps leftovers in Tupperware boxes and famously turns the heating down even in the depths of a freezing Balmoral winter.The costs run up by Charles and Camilla (including an eye-watering £362,000 to charter a plane on a visit to the Far East last year) are just the sort of excesses his mother frowns upon.And they will make her determined not to hand over the reins to her eldest son while she still has breath in her body. CORRIE will be a duller show without the luminous Catherine Tyldesley, who has filmed her final scenes as poor Eva.We all knew Catherine was a cracking comic turn, but over the past few months Eva’s storyline has gone to some very dark places indeed.And Catherine more than proved her skill as a ­dramatic actress, right up there with the best of them.I reckon she could easily gain the kind of success enjoyed by Corrie alumini such as Sarah ­Lancashire, Suranne Jones and Katherine Kelly.Like them, Catherine is a truly authentic performer, and she has already made the bold move of ­ changing her hair colour to distance ­herself from Eva and to show the world she means business.I wish her all the very best.She’s a lovely woman who truly deserves success and she has proved again that most of the top acting on our screens comes from the once-derided soaps. VERY sad to hear that Johnny Depp’s teenage son Jack is suffering from what is being described as “serious health problems”.His mum Vanessa Paradis missed the Paris premiere of her latest movie to stay with the 16-year-old.The couple never got married but they were together for 14 years until they split in 2012. Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

including Irish border solutions - can be concluded in time for Britain\u0027s departure in nine months\u0027 time.Among other outstanding issues on the UK\u0027s withdrawal agreement, EU leaders welcomed \"further progress\" but noted the application of the deal to Gibraltar \"still needs to be agreed\".The bloc agreed \"work must also be accelerated\" on the future UK-EU relationship, with Brussels waiting on the prime minister to set out her detailed plans.They also repeated an offer that, if Mrs May ditches her Brexit red lines on the single market, customs union and European Court of Justice, they will \"be prepared to reconsider\" their offer on a future relationship.The prime minister used the time she was allowed at the summit\u0027s working dinner on Thursday, before talks turned to migration, to make a plea to EU leaders to consider the safety of their citizens amid intransigence by Brussels officials on future security co-operation.However, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar raised doubt over how forcefully Mrs May had been able to make her point.Asked for his thoughts about Mrs May\u0027s speech, Mr Varadkar asked reporters: \"There was a speech?\"On his arrival at the European Council summit to brief EU leaders on Friday morning, the bloc\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned \"time is very short\" to conclude a Brexit deal and that a \"huge and serious\" gap remains between the EU and UK, in particular on the Irish border issue.He said: \"We have made progress but huge and serious divergence remains, in particular on Ireland and Northern Ireland.\"After Brexit the EU wants an EU-UK ambitious partnership, on trade as well as on security.\"But we have to base this partnership on our values and our principles, respecting also the UK red lines.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-angela-merkel-eu-summit_4348647.jpg?20180629090735 ","title":"eu leaders reach deal on migration at summit","story":"Leaders also agreed to tighten the EU\u0027s external border, with more funding for countries such as Turkey and Morocco, as well as the Libyan coastguard, which it warned rescue vessels in the Mediterranean not to obstruct the operations of.Speaking after the summit, European Council President Donald Tusk warned reaching an agreement was \"the easiest part of the task compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it\".However, MSF emergencies chief Karline Keijer reacted with anger to the deal.\"The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping,\" she said.The charity also accused the deal of aiming to \"demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations\", with Ms Keijer adding: \"Without batting an eyelid, they have formalised - through financing and training - the use of the Libyan coastguard to intercept people and return them to Libya.\"European governments do this fully in the knowledge that these people will be sent to arbitrary detention and subject to extreme abuse.\"She claimed the agreement would hinder charities\u0027 efforts to save lives through work \"EU governments are failing to do, all the while dehumanising people in need\", as she warned: \"Any deaths caused by this are now at their hands.\"UN aid agencies gave a cautious welcome to the agreement, but warned disembarkation points should not be set up in Libya.\"We will welcome any outcome from Europe that leads to a more collaborative and harmonised approach to asylum, and also one that has at its core and priority saving lives at sea,\" said Charlie Yaxley of refugee agency UNHCR.The continuing challenge posed by migrant routes to Europe was laid bare within hours of the deal being agreed on Friday, with the Libyan coastguard revealing around 100 people are thought to have drowned off the country\u0027s western coast.Although the number of illegal border crossings into the EU has fallen by 95% from the peak of the migration crisis in October 2015, internal tensions over how to deal with continuing arrivals on the bloc\u0027s coastlines have recently increased.This follows the election of anti-immigration and populist parties in Italy, who have demanded other EU states take a greater share of responsibility for migrants, while German Chancellor Angel Merkel is also battling for her political survival over the issue.After the agreement was struck, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte claimed his country, which has recently refused to let several migrant rescue boats dock at its ports, was \"not alone anymore\". French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal was \"good news\", while Ms Merkel echoed his sentiments but acknowledged deep divisions remained among member states.\"Overall, after an intensive discussion on the most challenging theme for the EU, namely migration, it is a good signal that we agreed a common text,\" she said.\"We still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views.\"Mrs Merkel had previously warned the EU\u0027s \"destiny\" was at stake if it failed to reach an agreement."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-eu-summit_4348509.jpg?20180629010550 ","title":"frustration for eu leaders as may stalls on brexit during summit","story":"In reality, Brexit has been eclipsed by a far more pressing career crisis for German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the EU migration row pushes her government to the brink.Ahead of the summit she warned that the migration crisis could make or break the EU, but Italy\u0027s first populist government appears to not have got the memo.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte blocked all joint decisions - on a range of matters from defence co-operation to digital innovation - ahead of the summit dinner, catching his counterparts off guard.Concerned about the pressures on frontline countries, Mr Conte is angry that the focus has shifted in recent days as Chancellor Merkel tries to snuff out the political crisis in her own country by trying to strike bilateral deals to make it easier for Germany to send asylum seekers back to other EU states.Other leaders are more keen to help.Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg told Sky News: \"I think migration is the biggest issue now, down to the fact we need to find solutions.\"We\u0027re going into the summer season and we know there\u0027s more people in the Med and there\u0027s a need for new projects.\"As Operation Save Merkel kicks in, Mrs May will make her way back to London to prepare for her own crunch summit in 10 days\u0027 time.She will gather her cabinet at her Chequers country retreat to finally set out exactly what she wants from Brexit.Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said today that Brussels, and Dublin, are fed up with waiting.\"We actually need to see the white paper from the British government as to what they believe the relationship should be like,\" he told Sky News.\"And it is frustrating two years after the referendum that we still don\u0027t have a white paper from the UK government as to what they think the relationship should look like.\":: EU migration summit deadlocked by ItalyBut the EU is also using this summit to remind the prime minister that they are prepared to trade with her too.The draft guidelines have been redrafted to reiterate to Mrs May that the bloc could improve their offer if she softens some of those red lines.\"The EU27, including Ireland, have always said that we\u0027re willing to be flexible if the UK softens its red lines well then we will soften ours as well,\" the taoiseach added.Pressing Mrs May to move on her red lines is the growing drumbeat."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-annapolis-capital-gazette_4349313.jpg?20180629210208 ","title":"gazette columnist city is in a state of shock","story":"Smith, a veteran reporter for various news outlets and a former foreign correspondent, said he was impressed by the newspaper\u0027s effort in putting out Friday\u0027s edition after the shooting.The paper reported on the shooting and said it had \"intentionally left blank\" its opinion page to commemorate the victims of the attack and also because \"today, we are speechless\".\"The front page today, is a remarkable job, produced under the worst possible circumstances,\" he said.\"I was impressed they were able to get the paper out under these circumstances.\"Smith also paid tribute to the newspaper, one of the oldest in the country.\"It\u0027s a broad, open office, there was deliberately little security in keeping with their efforts to be open with community,\" he said.\"It\u0027s been around since 1727 and was rebellious about the crown before 1776.\"That sense of being open and part of the community was reflected in the design and openness of the newsroom and yesterday a man with a gun took advantage of that.\"Officials described how the gunman barricaded the back exit to prevent anyone from escaping and blasted his way through the newsroom with a pump-action shotgun.Smith said he called the newspaper\u0027s editor Rick Hutzell as soon as he heard what was happening, but he was \"on the road\".Smith was sceptical that any change in gun control might occur, despite the high number of mass shootings plaguing America.\"How many times does this [the gun control debate] have to be reignited?

And Downing Street was equally restrained, noting only that people who appear on broadcasts and in newspapers are perfectly entitled to their opinions. Theresa May did not see the broadcast, as she was having dinner with EU leaders at the European Council in Brussels at the time, said a spokeswoman. He delivered the inspired rant on a surreal late-night edition of Good Morning Britain - entitled Good Evening Britain.   As Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and for some reason Tory deputy chairman James Cleverly looked on, Dyer channelled the righteous fury of the British people.   Dyer said: Who knows about Brexit ? No-one\u0027s got a f***ing clue what Brexit is. You watch Question Time, it\u0027s comedy.  His fury rising, he went on: No-one knows what it is. It\u0027s like this mad riddle.  So what\u0027s happened to that t**t David Cameron who called it on? Let\u0027s be fair.  Obviously, Piers Morgan stepped in. I think you\u0027re referring to our former Prime Minister, he said. Undeterred, Dyer continued: How comes he can scuttle off? He called all this on. Where is he? Is he in Europe? Is he in Nice, with his trotters up? Where is the geezer? I think he should be held account for it. He should be held account for it.

MPs warn that failing to pump extra cash into the military to fund a morale-boosting wage hike will further hit soldiers’ spirits. Publishing a key study on Armed Forces Day, the Commons Defence Committee urged ministers to axe a 1% limit on salary rises. The annual Armed Forces Covenant report says: “If the MoD retains the 1% pay cap for Service personnel while other departments increase their pay, it will undermine morale and have an increased negative effect on recruitment and retention.  “While the Government has signalled that there is some flexibility for departments to move away from the public sector pay cap of 1%, it seems that no additional funding will be made available to the MoD to pay for increases above this level for Service personnel.” Chairman Julian Lewis said: “It would be disgraceful if our Service people missed out on an increase in pay while they watched others who work for the Government receive pay awards. “What kind of message does that send to soldiers about how much we value the difficult and sometimes dangerous job that they do?” The 60-page study also blasts a contract with CarillionAmey for troops’ housing as “not fit for purpose”.  And MPs criticise a deal with Annington Homes to privatise Forces accommodation as “a disastrous failure”. Meanwhile, speaking ahead of today’s Armed Forces celebration in Llandudno, north Wales, Mrs May announced a new national games for wounded, injured and sick veterans and personnel, inspired by Prince Harry’s Invictus Games. More than 400 veterans and personnel will compete in events including athletics, wheelchair basketball, power lifting, swimming and sitting volleyball. Mrs May said: “As our brave Armed Forces face dangers on our behalf, it is only right that we do everything we can to help their recovery when they suffer injuries or illness during combat or training.  “Through these new British athletic games and the rehabilitative power of sport, we can help those who have sacrificed so much for our country to lead full and rewarding lives.” Next year’s Armed Forces Day national event will be held in Salisbury, the PM revealed. The Wiltshire cathedral city has tight links with the Army, through the huge training area on Salisbury Plain and its closeness to the Tidworth and Bulford garrisons.  The choice of location has added significance because of the Novichok nerve poisoning in the city in March.   Former KGB agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with a chemical weapon, in an attempted assassination blamed on Russia.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

Glamorous boys and girls began arriving from 8am this morning in an array of vehicles and outfits as hundreds of residents lined the streets to watch. And while most students wear one dress for their prom, many here opt for two - one for the day and another for the evening meal and disco. Some even woke up at the crack of dawn to get their hair and makeup professionally done, and the event is considered bigger than a lot of people\u0027s weddings. Colourful pictures show high-spirited GCSE pupils arriving at their big day in a spectacular line of vintage cars.  The elaborate displays were put on by 15 and 16-year-old pupils at Somervale School, Midsomer Norton, Somerset. It is a small town which has built a reputation for its no-expense-spared school proms. In previous years pupils at the two secondary schools have tried to upstage each other by arriving in ice cream vans, tractors, mobility scooters - and even a TANK. This year, the most unusual included a VW camper van nicknamed ‘Mr Happy’ and a vintage orange Mustang. Preparations begin in September for the annual occasion, which started at 8am on Friday morning with pupils from the younger years and parents crowding around to watch the procession.  Students flocked to the school dressed in glamorous attire, before leaving at noon to get ready for their evening meal and disco at the Hilton Hotel in Bath, Somerset. The GCSE leavers have been partaking in the prom for more than ten years, and imaginative forms of transport - including some pupils arriving in a boat pulled on a trailer one year - have set a high standard. Staff member Karen Pullman said: “It’s as elaborate as a wedding, with the daytime and evening outfits worn by the girls.” This year pupils arrived in two open top vintage Cadillacs, an orange Mustang, and a VW campervan decked out with ribbons. Pupil Amber Sims, 16, arrived in the campervan with several girlfriends. She said: “I’ve been looking forward to it for the past few months.  “I’ve been planning my outfit since the start of Year 11. “We wanted something different from a limo so chose a camper van. “It was exciting having everyone watching when we arrived.” Her mother Lisa Sims, 44, added: “My son is 18 and went to his prom in a kit car, with his dad dressed as the Stig. “Amber’s organised all of it with her pals, they’re a really good group of friends. “It can be very expensive. We’ve spent about \u0026pound150 on it but some of her friends have spent more on just the dress.”  She doubted her daughter would wear her pink jewelled gown again. Mrs Sims, a mother-of-three, added: “They all look amazing.” The event can can cost an eye-watering amount for parents who foot the bill, including for dresses costing more than \u0026pound400. Tori Collins, 15, arrived in the camper van with Amber, and said: “I got up at 5.30am to do my hair and make-up. “We liked the way the camper van looked, and no-one else was doing it. “It’s good to be different, and it makes you stand out, but it’s not a competition.”  Her mother Sarah Collins, 48, said: “We’ve spent about \u0026pound250 in total, on the car hire, two dresses, one for the daytime and one for the evening. “Then there’s two pairs of shoes, two handbags, getting her nails done, and the evening meal. “That’s with a relatively conservative amount on the dress, which cost \u0026pound25. “Some people spent \u0026pound400 just on a dress. “It must be difficult for some parents but they do all seem to manage, some of them arrive in their parents cars which are decorated for the occasion.”  She added that her son arrived at his prom on a space hopper two years ago. Joe MacLachlan, 16, arrived in a limousine with eight friends, all boys. He said: “We went for a drive around the local area before arriving at school, it was fun, we had music on and just relaxed. “It’s a bit strange seeing everyone in suits.” Nathan Rogers, 16, arrived in a 1965 Cadillac with five friends, also all male. “I think prom is bigged up in America but here it’s a nice thing when you’ve finished exams,” he said. “It gives you something to look forward to.  “Boys tend to go with boys, and girls tend to go with girls. “I think parents see it as a reward for all the hard work with GCSEs.” The prom used as an incentive by the school, and in order to go, pupils must have good attendance, good behaviour, and attend at least two revision sessions either after school or at lunchtime, per week. Of the 85 pupils in Year 11, 60 went to the prom and only a small number were excluded. Others chose not to go, and of the 60 who did, not all were attending the evening event.

Dramatic pictures have been released showing the bitumen melting in parts of the country - with up to eight heatwaves forecast in July and August and temperatures set to hit 34C.  Councils are using gritters to spread sand, effectively a sunscreen for the surface. Images of the melted roads have been shared by the staff of the Communication Workers Union as a warning to try and keep members of the public safe.  One was taken by a post office worker on Exmoor showing the current state of the road from Heasley Mill, near North Molton, Devon. Other images which show roads in Woodbury Salterton, Devon, melting have also been circulated. Tarmac becomes soft at 50C, and while the air temperature is much lower, the black roads can become that hot in direct sunlight. Howard Robinson, chief executive of the Road Surface Treatments Association, said that when temperatures top 30C, the bitumen in some road surfaces may soften and rise to the top. He said: “This makes the road surface sticky and more susceptible to pressure loads from heavy vehicles resulting in surface ridging and rutting. “Most roads will not begin to soften until they hit a temperature of around 50C.  “However, even a sunny day in the 20Cs can be enough to generate 50C on the ground as the dark asphalt road surface absorbs a lot of heat and this builds up during the day. “The response for local highway authorities is to send out the gritters to spread granite dust or sand to absorb the soft bitumen and so stabilise the road surface and make it less sticky. “Drivers may be bemused to see the gritters out in the summer when they are usually spreading grit and salt during the winter. “However, this is effective standard practice for keeping a road surface safe during extreme hot temperatures. “Asphalt is like chocolate – it melts and softens when it’s hot and goes hard and brittle when it’s cold – it doesn’t maintain the same strength all year round.” "},{"url":null,"title":"historic royals seen colour first","story":"NewsThe Queen cradles baby Anne with blond Prince Philip in stunning colour pictures of glamorous Royal FamilyQueen Victoria, King George V and Queen Mary are among the royals who feature in a stunning set of photos which were originally black and white\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMark McConville17:09, 29 JUN 2018Updated17:12, 29 JUN 2018NewsKing George V is among the royals who features in the stunning series of colourised images (Image: Nicola Branson / mediadrumworld.)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMonarchs of the past can now be seen in full colour for the first time - thanks to an enthusiastic royalist housewife.

The images were painstakingly produced by Nicola Branson, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire. The 47-year-old was initially planning simply to share the pictures on her Instagram page.  She said: I decided to look at the Royals for colouring as a private project originally that I was going to share on my Instagram account, but a few close friends who have seen me working on these photos suggested they were amazed how they looked more like a colour photo rather than a coloured photo. The Royals through their generations have all been very photogenic and my personal favourite is the Queen Mother. My dad, a few months before he died, said to me \u0027what\u0027s the point of having all these photos when now you can keep them on your phone or PC?\u0027 My response was that they are all memories dad, and memories can live forever.  Through today\u0027s technology old photos can be restored and colour added, those people can have pride of place in a photo frame. The British royal family comprises Queen Elizabeth II and her close relations. There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the British royal family.  Since 1917, when King George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, members of the royal family belong, either by birth or by marriage, to the House of Windsor. Nicola, who used Adobe Photoshop to restore and instil colour into the photos, explained how she became interested in the quirky hobby. I started restoring and colourising old photos by my interest in genealogy, she said. When my dad died I started looking at the old photos that had been passed down from my grandparents.

Roads have melted and train tracks have reached 49C (120.2F) as the prolonged hot spell continues into the weekend with almost no end in sight.  The first hosepipe ban began in Northern Ireland at 6pm on Friday, with plenty more hot sunshine forecast for the coming days. Northern Ireland Water said demand was outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water. Elsewhere across the UK consumers are being urged to take simple steps to reduce the amount of water they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden. NI Water chief executive Sara Venning said: We have maximised our water production and need customers\u0027 help to reduce demand. We are asking customers to take heed of the hosepipe ban and stop non-essential water use - using hoses and sprinklers is causing demand to exceed the capacity to supply. According to the latest information from the Met Office, the highest temperature on Friday was 32.5C (90.5F) in Porthmadog in Wales. The mercury hit 30.1C (86.2F) in Castlederg in Northern Ireland, 29.4C (84.9F) in Bridgefoot in England, and 28.4C (83.1F) in Threave, Scotland.  Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said temperatures may be slightly lower over the weekend, but will widely be in the balmy mid to high twenties. Britons enjoyed the hottest temperature of the year for the fourth day in a row on Thursday as the mercury soared to 33C (91.4F) once again in Porthmadog in Wales. While temperatures appear to have peaked for now, they will remain high into the weekend and early next week. Saturday could see highs of 29C (84.2F) in England and Scotland, 27C (80.6F) in Northern Ireland and Wales, and predicted highs of around 31C (87.8F) in some parts of the UK by Monday. Gritters have been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.  Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles. Some railway track soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend. Trains had to be stopped from running over a section of track near Carlisle station on Thursday. Speed restrictions have been in place all week on the route from London Waterloo to New Malden due to the scorching temperatures, causing delays to services. Translink Rail services also felt the heat as they were forced to delay and cancel services across Northern Ireland on Thursday as rail lines reached over 50C and began to buckle.  The Met Office \u0027s heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.   This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said. Public Health England issued a warning saying the extreme heat may pose a risk to the most vulnerable. The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires. The heat has already claimed casualties. The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water. They said: We just cannot emphasis enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned. Our message is simple, please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation. It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening. The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday. The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard. There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days. Mr Madge said: There is a low probability of showers on Sunday. If they do bring some rainfall it would be in the South West but that will be very sporadic. Parts of Saddleworth Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.

Smitten Gary Guest met his “princess” Marie in a bar in Albufeira in Portugal during a lads’ holiday and told her: You can be my Vicky Pattison after buying her drink. But he failed to get her number and when he returned home to Nottingham he couldn’t think of anything else but her. Armed with the only information he had - her first name and that she was from the North East - he tried to find her on social media. Unable to search through the thousands of Maries, he asked his local paper Chronicle Live to play Cupid and put out his plea for the correct Marie to step forward.  And within hours of our story going live, Gary was put in touch with the woman of his dreams - Marie Donnelly from Gateshead. “Obviously I was really, really shocked but proper flattered,” said Marie, 29, who works in public relations - and is single. “Two of my friends, who I was on holiday with in Albufeira, are in Ibiza at the minute and they saw the story online over there. One of the girls tagged me in and said ‘that is 100% you he is looking for’.”  She added: “When the story popped up on Facebook my heart was pounding, it is a lovely thing for him to do.” Gary was sitting in Sir Harry’s bar in the Old Town Square with his friends on Tuesday, June 19, at around 11pm when Marie walked in. The 42-year-old couldn’t take his eyes off her and asked to buy her a drink via the bar waitress. Gary then took the drink over to her and said ‘that is for a beautiful princess’.  Marie then thanked him and kissed him on the cheek. The guys asked her name and she told them she was Marie from the North East.

It was a devastating moment for both mum and daughter as Fiona prepared to fall into a deep drug-induced sleep from which she expected to never wake. The terminally ill 31-year-old had bravely opted for medication to relieve her agonising pain that she knew, as a side effect, would result in sedation.  Determined to not be a vegetable after cancer snatched away her ability to move, eat or drink, she had told her mum: \u0027I really want to die with dignity.  But devastatingly, Fiona did not get her wish. Instead of \u0027sleeping\u0027 peacefully until she took her final breaths, as hoped, she woke up just 20 minutes later. And for the next four days, she continued to wake. Confused and scared, she would scream out in pain as her loved ones and doting nurses tried to comfort her.  Each time, Susan would say another \u0027last goodbye\u0027 to her daughter, who had told medics she did not want to be fed or watered while receiving end-of-life care. But it was only after SEVEN, gut-wrenching farewells that Fiona eventually died at The Margaret Centre at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London on May 1. Now, weeks on from her death, her mum is campaigning for assisted dying - and insists she would have helped her daughter to end her own life, if possible. We must have said our goodbyes six or seven times until she finally passed away, said Susan, who described Fiona\u0027s treatment as \u0027terminal sedation\u0027. She underwent five days of continual waking and pain. Every time she fell asleep, we thought that would be it. It would be very upsetting - then she\u0027d wake up again. At one point, she woke up and was thirsty. I gave her a drink and she said. \u0027Mum, stop trying to keep me alive.\u0027 It was scary for her as well. It\u0027s not what she wanted. It was torturous.  She added: It was more difficult [for Fiona] because she was having to say goodbyes to everybody again and again and again. There was no peace of mind. Even the nurses and doctors at the hospice were in distress as there was nothing further they could do to ease her suffering. Continuous deep sedation, often labelled \u0027terminal sedation\u0027 or \u0027palliative sedation\u0027 by relatives, has been used for decades to relieve the suffering of the terminally ill. The hospice says while it increased Fiona\u0027s sedation to relieve her agitation as safely as it could, she did experience some consciousness in her final days. Although the young woman was not given food or liquid at this time, in accordance with her wishes, her mouth and lips were kept moist by hospice nurses. She was also given medication to relieve her unbearable pain. But despite medics\u0027 best efforts to care for her at the facility in Leytonstone, they could not stop her excruciating suffering - because of the law, her mum said.  [The doctors] didn\u0027t use the words \u0027terminal sedation\u0027 said Susan, who was joined at the hospice by Fiona\u0027s dad, Clive Strong, and devoted boyfriend, Alex Paxton. She claimed: They said to Fi, \u0027We could sedate you and you wouldn\u0027t wake up after about four hours and eventually just stay asleep.\u0027 The mum-of-two, 61, is now fighting for compassionate euthanasia in a bid to prevent hundreds of others from going through the same ordeal Fiona did. If she was well enough I\u0027d have taken her to Dignitas in Switzerland, she said. She was screaming out all the time, even with all that pain relief. It was just awful. All she wanted to do was keep her dignity in tact and be pain-free. We would not allow an animal to suffer like this. She added: Fiona was so stoic and brave but how she died was so unnecessary.  Assisted dying is illegal in the UK, but a Mirror poll this week found three out of four Brits would support a law change to allow it. They want people with a terminal illness who have six months or less to live to be given the right to decide when they die.   Fiona was first diagnosed with the rare and aggressive childhood cancer rhabdomyosarcoma - a type of soft tissue sarcoma - in October 2015. She had been complaining of headaches, a numb face and nausea for weeks, but it was only after her eye began protruding that a tumour was discovered in her paranasal sinuses. They told her it was a tumour and to prepare for cancer, Susan added. They had to do a biopsy to test whether it was the disease. After undergoing a biopsy at St George\u0027s Hospital in Tooting, south London, Fiona, then 28, returned to her Leytonstone home, where she was constantly sick. It was the tumour pressing on her brain causing her to be sick, her mum explained. We didn\u0027t sleep all night. As the sickness grew worse, Fiona ended up being admitted to hospital, where she was later told the news she and her family had feared.  The consultant came in and said, \u0027Unfortunately, it\u0027s a very rare type of cancer. It usually affects children but is very unusual in adults\u0027, Susan said. I was in bits, I was devastated. Fiona, who worked for a market research company, was told the tumour was in an awkward position, located in the bone and sinus behind her right eye. For the next 14 months, she underwent treatment at The Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, including gruelling rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She suffered facial paralysis and spent her 29th birthday in intensive care battling sepsis - but faced it all with humour, dignity and incredible courage. Fiona gave the disease the respect it deserved but she didnt let it define her. She didn\u0027t want to be the person who was talking about her illness, Susan said. Despite her own struggles, Fiona also went out of her way to help others, raising more than \u0026pound10,000 for cancer charities and donating her brunette hair to the Little Princess Trust. And in January 2017, she was given something she had dreamed of - the all-clear.  But tragically, after only four months of remission, her eye started playing up again and doctors told her that a new cancerous tumour had been found. Despite undergoing further chemotherapy, radiotherapy, a clinical trial and even surgery to remove her eye at Moorfields Eye Hospital, the disease spread. Before long, Fiona\u0027s tumour had invaded both her brain and her nose, making it difficult for her to breathe - with the cancer also in her neck, shoulder and spine. A nurse was coming to the house to give her pain relief, Susan said. They said, \u0027I think we should get her to a hospice\u0027. In constant pain, Fiona was admitted to The Margaret Centre on April 9, where she was joined by mostly elderly patients and a team of compassionate nurses. She was on so many drugs, but they still couldn\u0027t control the pain, Susan said. She said to me, \u0027I\u0027m going to give it till April 27. If I don\u0027t feel any better, I want you to help me end my life. Take me to Switzerland or something\u0027. Before her admission, Fiona\u0027s loved ones had begun raising more than \u0026pound100,000 for immunotherapy treatment which would have started later that month.  They raised a whopping \u0026pound43,000 of their target, and despite her rapidly deteriorating condition, the young woman vowed to give it one last shot. Fiona said, \u0027even if immunotherapy gives me a few weeks extra\u0027, Susan said. She had a network of friends who were absolutely incredible. But unfortunately, Fiona, who loved scuba diving, travelling and socialising with pals, never got the chance to undergo immunotherapy. To her and her family\u0027s horror, her cancer was growing too quickly. She had lost all mobility in her legs, couldn\u0027t walk, could partially move her neck... the tumour was growing so much it had grown into her neck, her mum said. Her tongue was swollen so she was finding it difficult to speak and eat. In late April, doctors asked Fiona what she wanted to happen. She said, \u0027I really want to die with dignity\u0027, I don\u0027t want to be a vegetable where I can\u0027t speak. I can\u0027t move and I\u0027ve got no quality of life,\u0027 Susan said.  Fiona was told she could undergo end-of-life treatment to relieve her distress which, as a side effect, would cause her to fall into a \u0027deep sleep\u0027, according to her mum. She said that\u0027s what she wanted, she said. The young woman agreed to the treatment - involving syringe drivers and no food or water - which she hoped would leave her sedated until her eventual death. We all sat around her bed and said our goodbyes. We thought that that was going to be it. But it never happened... she kept waking up, Susan said. In some ways it was alarming because we were pleased she\u0027d woken up selfishlessly. It was like a rollercoaster. She claimed that even the doctors and nurses were left stunned. Fiona would say something poignant about us all, it was quite distressing, said Susan, who is divorced from her daughter\u0027s dad and now with partner Steve, 62. We\u0027d think \u0027well that\u0027s it\u0027. And then she\u0027d wake up. The nurses were in tears. In her final hours, Fiona\u0027s breathing became laboured and she started suffering from blood clots in her mouth, which caused her to gurgle.  The nurses had to use a suction pump to take them out, her mum said. She added: She then started making a noise as if she was calling me but couldn\u0027t speak. I got up and held her hand. She couldn\u0027t talk but she was aware I was there. The nurse said her breathing was getting shallower. Soon after, the young woman took her last breaths. She finally passed away on the Tuesday morning, said Susan, who moved down South from her home in Fife, Scotland, to care for Fiona. At the end of the day I didn\u0027t want to lose Fiona,but I didn\u0027t want her to be in pain. She definitely should\u0027ve been allowed to end her own life. It wasn\u0027t what we imagined at all. She added she was pleased with the results from the Mirror poll on assisted dying. I think there should be a nationwide poll for it, she said. Patients have got a responsibility to themselves. Ultimately, it\u0027s your body. She continued:  People are still going to die at the end of the day. In this day and age, we have to be more open-minded about death.  Addressing concerns about relaxing euthanasia rules, the mum said she believes patients should have to sign a detailed document about their treatment. We shouldn\u0027t be a passive patient, said Susan, who is currently staying at a friend\u0027s house, as she sorts out Fiona\u0027s belongings and flat. You\u0027d have to be aware of what you were getting, it would need to be open. There could even be a medical card, like there has been with organ donation. She added:Fiona\u0027s quality of life had diminished drastically by the end. There does have to be a degree of dignity. We can keep people alive but it\u0027s wrong to keep them alive if they are suffering things so great. I wouldn\u0027t want my worst enemy to go through what Fiona went through. Critics have said relaxing assisted dying laws would put pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives out of fear of being a financial, emotional and care burden. However, campaign organisation Dignity in Dying says terminally ill adults such as Fiona should have the right to die on their own terms. A spokesman told the Mirror: “Nobody deserves to die in pain, suffering and without dignity. For most people, palliative care is excellent and will be able to give the vast majority of us a good death.

Joan Birch, 56, suffered diarrhoea and vomiting just a few days into her trip to the Club Hotel Riu Negril on the island\u0027s west coast.  Her symptoms were so severe that, when she got back to UK, she claims she was put in a private isolation room in hospital on an IV drip for six days, Liverpool Echo reports.  The mum, from Prenton, Wirral, said: The illness left me in a really bad way and it was hugely frustrating to know we had spent so much money on the break yet neither I nor my husband got a chance to enjoy it fully.  I need medication for my heart and other issues so the fact I was unable to keep that down was also hugely worrying. Joan has now called in specialist lawyers to help her get compensation from tour operators TUI, which used to be known as Thomson. “When we got back to the UK the symptoms were ongoing, so I went to my GP and was admitted to hospital straight away. Having to be treated in isolation was hugely concerning and I still can’t believe that this has happened to me, she added. Joan\u0027s legal team has called the case extremely worrying. And the mum now refuses to travel with TUI again.

Stephen Gee crept into his neighbour\u0027s garden armed with a bladed weapon which he used to slash a hole in the metal wall of the pool, causing 4,000 litres of water to gush out. The 63-year-old had become fed up with the noise made by Jason Little\u0027s children when using the 10m long pool.  So the retired aircraft engineer staged a nighttime raid to sabotage it - and was caught in CCTV footage.  Mr Little, a decorated army major, and his wife Avril were away at the time and when they returned to their \u0026pound600,000 home they found their pool empty and their garden flooded. When Mr Little reviewed the video from his hidden CCTV camera, he found footage of his hooded neighbour taken at 4.30am, tiptoeing up his garden path, past his herbaceous border and towards his pool. Gee disappeared behind the structure for 16 seconds before re-emerging and sneaking back to his house.  Although Gee had left a note in the Littles\u0027 porch explaining how he had woken in the night to the sound of flowing water and found their garden flooded, Mr Little called the police. A court heard that the attack was the culmination of a four year dispute between the neighbours over the noise made when the Littles\u0027 children used the pool. Mr Little, who won the Military Cross for displaying inspirational leadership in battle in Afghanistan in 2008, had moved into a large detached house in the Dorset village of Puxey in 2012 with his family. Although the oval swimming pool, which measured 10m by 4m, was already installed, his new neighbours soon took offence to his children using it. Mr Little, 46, told the court: The pool was already there when we moved in and we started using it. Almost immediately they seemed to take offence to the fact we have children and the children make noise. Whenever they used the swimming pool, they shouted over the fence at them and would play loud music and stare at them. Before we had CCTV things happened to the swimming pool that I couldn\u0027t explain, so we had cameras installed to the rear of the property.  Mr Little said they hadn\u0027t used the pool that summer of 2016 but he had carried out maintenance and checks so the children could start using it again. He checked the pool before he left to go away on the weekend of June 19, 2016 and the water level was full and there was no leak. The CCTV camera hidden on a conservatory to cover the back garden showed Gee stood behind the pool for 16 seconds before leaving the garden. PC Charlotte Goddard told Poole Magistrates\u0027 Court it looked like the wall of the pool had been hit hard with something heavy and the cut was wider at one end, like an axe blade or similar had hit it. She said that in the CCTV footage it looked like Gee was carrying something heavy in his right hand as he approached the pool, although it is not clear what. The cost of the damage ran to \u0026pound1,500, although Mr Little said he claimed it through his house insurance and only had to pay the \u0026pound250 excess. Gee, who worked in the aviation industry for 25 years, pleaded not guilty to criminal damage.

ATMs across the country are closing at a rate of almost 300 every month , according to a new study by consumer watchdog Which?.   Now, it is warned changes to the machines in a desperate bid to keep more open will result in thousands being changed to fee-charging, Devon Live reports.  So this will mean more and more consumers will be charged to get cash out.  Which? also suggested a previous attempt to protect cashpoints in rural areas by network Link was ineffective. Link, the shared network of ATMs in the UK, is to cut the fees operators receive from banks when the cashpoints are used. But there are fears this will impact the consumers directly with more fee-charging machines operating. Link said the effect was expected to be a modest decline in the number of ATMs in areas where they are heavily concentrated but with no diminution in the overall geographical coverage. This will be reviewed annually. Which?\u0027s study found that almost 1,500 machines closed between November last year and April, which it said was a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015. The investigation found that machines in rural communities were at least as badly hit as urban areas - down 2.1% and 2% respectively - across the UK.

Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, died in hospital on April 12 2015 after taking eight tablets containing the poisonous Dinitrophenol (DNP). Bernard Rebelo was sentenced at Inner London Crown Court on Friday. The 31-year-old, from Gosport in Hampshire, was previously convicted of two counts of manslaughter and one of placing unsafe food on the market. Miss Parry\u0027s mother Fiona Parry said her daughter had many problems in life but that there had been positive signs that things were changing for the better.  I had hoped that somehow they would be sorted, she said in a statement read to the court. She said her daughter had a number of plans for her future, including her degree, career and to travel the world. When Eloise died her life was undone and her possible future unravelled and in that moment the hope I had for her was also destroyed, she added. Rebelo admitted while giving evidence during the trial that he sold DNP to Miss Parry. He told the jury that he included a warning on his website that the substance was not for human consumption.  Rebelo\u0027s girlfriend Mary Roberts, 32, was cleared by the jury of one count of money laundering after she was accused of transferring \u0026pound20,000 for and on behalf of Rebelo. Ms Roberts said she had never seen capsules for making pills where she lived and if she had she would have asked her partner Rebelo why they were there. She also said she had taken little interest in asking details of a business Rebelo had set up to sell muscle enhancing supplements and protein shakes. The couple wept in the dock as the verdicts were delivered on Wednesday afternoon, with Rebelo asking the judge: Can I see my daughter? Ms Roberts could be heard crying as the couple hugged one another. The jury began its deliberations on Tuesday afternoon.  Miss Parry died after taking eight diet pills containing the highly toxic DNP. Her sister Rebecca Parry, now aged 19, said in a statement read out during the trial that she had been focused on losing weight. She noted that in the weeks and months leading up to her death, her sister had struggled more and more with her eating disorder. She said: The diet pills she had taken had made her lose a drastic amount of weight but she still wanted to be slimmer. Rebecca Parry said she left Eloise\u0027s house on April 11 at about 9pm and that her sister, who had been talking about doing a Master\u0027s degree, seemed happy but tired. She had leg pain. Rebecca said: She mentioned a takeaway but I told her not to order one unless she was sure she could eat it.

First, how exactly do you pronounce the word \u0027scone\u0027? Should it rhyme with \u0027gone\u0027 or \u0027bone\u0027? And secondly, should you put the jam first, and then the cream (like in Cornwall), or cream and then jam (like in Devon). Cream teas have been served in the UK since the 11th century, so it\u0027s a debate that has raged for hundreds of years. Wars have surely been fought over less. We\u0027re certainly not going to risk the wrath of half the country by siding one way or the other, but here\u0027s what the stats say - and which way The Queen falls on the argument  Scone or scone A poll by YouGov seems to have settled the debate once and for all. Their research revealed that most Britons (51%) pronounce it to rhyme with “gone” with around four in ten (42%) rhyming it with “bone.” YouGov believe the two key factors are region and social grade. They said: Those living in the North (60%) and Scotland (80%) overwhelmingly use the “gone” pronunciation, while those in the Midlands (56%) and London (50%) are much more likely to go with the “bone” option. The survey also shows that class is as important a factor in how “scone” is said, although maybe not in the way you’d expect. Those in the C2DE social grade (working class) are evenly split, with 45% going with the “bone” pronunciation and 46% going with “gone”. However, among ABC1s there is a very real split. The middle classes are far more likely to go with the “gone” option (55%) than “bone (“40%). Jam first or cream first? There\u0027s two schools of thought here - the Cornish method of spreading jam on the scone and putting a dollop of cream on top, or the Devon method of cream first, then jam YouGov found that 61% favour having their jam first and then cream. Meanwhile just 21% went with cream first.  What has the Queen got to say? The Queen is the most famous Brit on the planet, and she hosts a lot of tea parties, so she\u0027s probably a good person to settle the debate. A former royal chef revealed how her Majesty enjoys her scones at Buckingham Palace garden parties - and the news could anger Devonians. Darren McGrady, who was the personal chef to Elizabeth, II, Princess Diana and Princes William and Harry for 15 years, made the revelation on Twitter. He wrote: Jam first or Clotted Cream first? Jam first at Buckingham Palace garden parties!   Sausage rolls replace pork pies as \u0027snack barometer\u0027 to measure Brits cost of living  He later added: The Queen always had home-made Balmoral jam first (@tiptree little scarlet when we ran out) with clotted cream on top at Buckingham Palace garden parties in the Royal tea tent and all Royal tea parties. Some Twitter users agreed with the royal protocol, with one simply writing: The Queen is right. However, others were seemingly outraged. A user called Gavin tweeted: Refuse to believe that the Queen puts jam before clotted cream on her scones. That’s just plain wrong! When firms get it wrong As one of Britain\u0027s most contentious issues, officially coming out on one side or the other can get you in a lot of trouble online. Especially if your restaurant is in Cornwall and you show a picture of a Devon cream tea. Lanhydrock restaurant in Bodmin, Cornwall, infuriated Cornish locals after its Mother\u0027s Day advert displayed a cream tea made the Devon way, Cornwall Live reported. The image, shared by a National Trust site in Cornwall, was also branded unacceptable and shocking, with some Trust members even threatening to cancel their subscriptions.

But today, the monsters were each jailed for nine years at Canterbury Crown Court. Altun was caged for nine years and nine months while Amet and Engin were each sentenced to nine years in prison. The court heard police trawled through CCTV in a large-scale operation to track the yobs after the attack in Canterbury, Kent. The teenage victim had enjoyed a night out with friends. She was dumped on a street after the rape.  Detective sergeant Matt Banks of Kent Police said: These three men preyed upon a vulnerable woman and then took advantage of her in the worst possible way. They separated her from her friend during the early hours of the morning with a plan to fulfil their own depraved sexual desires. Thanks to the cooperation of the nightclub and other local businesses, we were able to obtain excellent footage, which showed the men on the lead up to the attack. This material has been vital to this investigation and instrumental in their conviction.

Nikki DuBose was just nine-years-old when her artist mum, Sandy Pierce, began her five year reign of abuse. Her childhood memories are full of being groped, witnessing domestic violence, watching her mum carry out sex acts, as well bath times taking a sinister turn.  It started with me taking baths, she told Entity Mag .  When I was around eight or nine, my mom would (as she called it) ‘take my temperature’ a lot in the bathroom. There were other things that happened.  Her sexual behavior escalated until I was 13. It was a very confusing time for me. Nikki tried to tell her dad, who divorced her mum when she was two, what was happening as well as the police, but she was living in fear she would be killed. Eventually police removed her from the house when she was 13. To numb the pain, Nikki suppressed the memories until her late 20s but it led to depression, suicide attempts, self-harm and bullimia. Her addictions also spiralled out of control and she started doing drugs, drinking a lot and partying from the age of 13.  Her mother, who was an alcoholic, suffered from her own addictions and had bipolar and dissociative identity disorder. The mental scars of what she\u0027d endured haunted Nikki, who grew up in Charleston, South Carolina and is now 33. And in her darkest moments she became a sex addict and slept with multiple people a day, including strangers, had affairs and also slept with her boss.  I did it all on autopilot, with a numbness in my soul that I couldn’t kill, Nikki wrote on an online blog .  Every time I thought I could walk away from the sex and the lifestyle, it trapped me like a slave, and I put myself in even more dangerous situations.  The sex always got riskier the inner pain, more pronounced. It wasn\u0027t until her mother died aged 45, due to an alcohol related car accident in 2012, Nikki knew she needed to get help and re-evaluate her life. She gave up her successful career travelling the world as a model, and appearing in the likes of Vogue, Maxim, Vanity Fair, to get away from the industry which was a \u0027trigger for her addictive personality\u0027.

Sandra Malcolm, 74, was hacked to death by Sheree Prince, 22, who had broken into her Cape Town home.  Mrs Malcolm, who was originally from Monifieth, Angus, had been helping the young woman after she suffered an injury - but Prince turned on her, fearing she would call police.  Prince said Mrs Malcolm fed her tea and toast, but when she offered to call an ambulance, Prince became suspicious and stabbed her 24 times.  Prince beheaded the pensioner with a knife and cut off her arms using an axe before throwing her body into a wheelie bin.  Police arrested Prince in Citrusdal, 100 miles north of Cape Town, a few days after the grandmother\u0027s death in April 2015. She admitted the murder in March and has now been given a life sentence at the Western Cape High Court. Under South African law, Prince will have to serve 25 years before she can apply for parole. Last month it was revealed the killer had written a letter to the family of Mrs Malcolm begging for forgiveness. The letter, which was handed to the court, read: I thank the court for doing my case. During my time in prison I have had time to think of everything. I wouldn\u0027t know who the family is, but I would like the family to please forgive me and accept my apology as time goes by. However, Mrs Malcolm\u0027s daughter Alison Williams, 51, told the court the letter meant nothing and called for Prince to face the harshest punishment possible. Speaking at a pre-sentencing hearing, she said: We cannot accept her apology. The whole family is asking for the highest amount of incarceration this court can hand down. We have not even begun grieving because of this court case. She deserves to stay behind bars where she belongs.

They were expecting a turnout of 20 people, in the end there were nearly 30.“I had traffic waiting to the left, right and behind me.”Pictures taken at the Broughty Ferry Lifeboat station include a crew photo and shots of coxswain Murray Brown, lifeboat navigator Fiona Johnston, lifeboat shore crew Sandra Chalmers and mechanic Scott Huggins.Colin Davidson, a spokesman for RNLI Broughty Ferry, said the crew found taking part in the photographs a great experience.He said: “As well as being fun to be part of, the crews were also given an insight into the history of photography.“The photographs developed from the shoot allowed the crews to see how they would have looked a long time ago, which caused interest and some amusement.“Broughty Ferry RNLI station being built in 1909 also added character. We wish Jack all the best for the rest of his project.”To take the photo of the crew Jack had to stand in the middle of the road at the T-junction on Fort Street, causing traffic to come to a stop while he worked.To track Jack on his travels you can follow him on social media or via thelifeboatstationproject.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b34a8316ddeb-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee man gary 22 lived a tragic life but is now with his family","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe grieving family of a Dundee man found dead in prison have paid tribute to his “kind soul”.Gary Williamson, of Byron Street, was found unconscious on June 14 in his cell at HM Prison Perth.The 22-year-old, who was buried on Thursday, had been sentenced just a day earlier for breaching a previous bail condition.The Scottish Prison Service has said a fatal accident inquiry will be held into his death.His adopted mother, Mhairi Cameron, paid tribute to Gary who she said had a “bubbly” personality despite having lived a tragic life.Gary’s sister Catherine died from meningitis aged eight, before Gary was born.When he was six, his mum Margaret died having had stomach problems, and, six years later, his dad Charles died of a heart attack.Three months after that, his brother, Charles junior, known as “Chicky”, took his own life aged 29.With no immediate family left, Mhairi and her husband Peter – who is Gary’s cousin – adopted him and took him in aged 11.Mhairi, 35, said: “As hard as it is, I think he’s in a place he wants to be, with his family.“Although he lived a sad life he was full of life. But he was a bit of a lost soul with all the tragedy in his life. A lost soul, but a kind soul.”Former Craigie High School pupil Gary, who was a gardener, was laid to rest next to his brother and dad at Birkhill Cemetery following a service in the Hilltown.Mhairi said the police had alerted them that he was unwell but the family weren’t initially told how serious a condition he was in.She said: “The CID came to us about 3am on the Thursday. They told us at that point he was ill in Perth Royal Infirmary.“I had problems with my phone but when I got through to the hospital they told us how serious it was and to grab anyone close to him and to get there. We were told he wasn’t going to make it.”Mhairi said with no brain activity detected, medics told the family there was nothing they could do for him. His life support was switched off at 10.30am.She said: “I had to leave before they turned the machine off – I couldn’t be there for that. I said my goodbyes and Peter and I left.“We have been told it was a cardiac arrest, but they don’t know if there were drugs or something else involved. We have to wait for the toxicology report and then a fatal accident inquiry.”She added: “Gary never really got over Chicky dying. He never understood him leaving him like that, I don’t think.\u0026#8220I’ll remember his cheeky smile, especially when he was lying to you. He knew you knew he was lying and that would always bring a smile to his face. He knew how to make you laugh and would do anything for you.“Gary was bubbly, outgoing, really helpful. And he liked to party with his friends.“A lot of people will be lost without him. Loads of people have got in touch since he died.“There are tributes on Facebook from his pals but I haven’t watched the videos people have shared. I’m not ready to hear his voice again, yet.”Peter, 35, said: “Gary liked his young life, spending time with his friends. I had known him all his life with him being my cousin.“He was a troubled soul because he lost his family. He did some daft stuff but he had a heart of gold. You could make him happy short-term, but long-term, he had lost too much.“He never really got over his brother’s death, he couldn’t make sense of it. He loved being out working, outdoors, gardening, doing cladding, things like that.“It was obviously very emotional when he died. It still doesn’t seem real.”Mhairi added: “It hasn’t sunk in I don’t think. I don’t want to believe it’s real. I think it’s because we don’t know what happened to him.“Once we do, then hopefully we can get some closure.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to

to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January

with the Hoops.Armstrong’s future at Celtic Park had been in doubt after negotiations over a new contract had stalled, leaving Brendan Rodgers to cash in with just a year to run on his current deal.He was part of the side that won the ‘double treble’ under Rodgers and won a total of eight major trophies during his time at the club.He scored 17 times in 2016-17 and forced his way into the Scotland setup but struggled to replicate that form last season after an injury.Armstrong is manager Mark Hughes’ first signing of the summer window after Southampton narrowly survived relegation from the top flight of English football, and the former Stoke boss was keen to add the Scot’s creativity to a squad that scored just 37 goals last season.Hughes said: “Stuart is a player who we have admired for some time, and I am delighted we have been able to bring him here, especially given the competition we faced to sign him.“We have strong players in the squad and it is important we build on that by adding different qualities.“It is important we add a greater goal threat to the team as a whole, and to our midfield specifically, and Stuart’s record of scoring and creating makes him an extremely exciting addition in that area.“He brings with him extensive experience of European football and has developed his game impressively over the past few seasons at a major club in Celtic, where there is a demand not only to perform but also to win. Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united coach ian cathro teams up with former boss at wolves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Hearts boss Ian Cathro has been appointed first-team coach of Premier League newcomers Wolves.Dundonian Cathro, who spent eight months at Tynecastle, was Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo’s assistant at Rio Ave in 2012 and at Valencia.The pair met on a Scottish Football Association coaching course in 2009.“I am very excited about joining Wolves and looking forward to working with a coach and staff I know, trust and believe in,” said Cathro.“All of us share the same footballing philosophy and that is such an important factor for a successful coaching team.“Wolves is a fantastic club with a rich history and lots of potential, and I can’t wait to get started.”Cathro, who began his coaching career at Dundee United, has also been assistant boss at Newcastle and met the Wolves squad on Wednesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b222ed15f5ad-847x564.jpg ","title":"more summer signings to come promises dundee gaffer mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann is delighted with the five summer signings he’s made so far and the Dundee boss is determined more will follow.Monday saw Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy fixed up on a two-year deal from Belgians Lokeren to join fellow-new boys Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph, Kharl Madianga and Elton Ngwatala in pre-season training.Neil felt it was import to get the bulk of his transfer business done as early as possible but his aim is to make more moves before the window slams shut at the end of August.“I hope to get one or two more in and we’ve always got targets,” said Neil.“This year we are a bit more advanced than we were this time last year and that’s good because I wanted to get a bit of business done immediately.“Now you go for ones who can probably be a wee bit more troublesome to get in but we are working hard on that and as the pre-season goes on maybe we’ll get a bit more business done.”To that end the gaffer has identified specific players and areas of the team where he wants to add more depth but will be giving nothing away on that until contracts have been signed.“I wouldn’t go into specific areas. There’s definitely specific targets on that and we are working hard on that but we won’t be giving anything away.”Missing from pre-season so far have been Craig Wighton and Glen Kamara both of whom were on international duty after their seasons with Dundee ended.Centre-half Steven Caulker has also been absent because of charity work he was committed to before joining up at Dens early this year but all three will report back today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32068acec06-839x564.jpg ","title":"new boy mendy almost signed by dundee in january","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has revealed he was close to signing new Dundee arrival Jean Alassane Mendy back in January.He held talks with the Senegalese striker back then but was pipped for his signature by Belgians Lokeren.Things did not work out for Mendy there and now Neil is delighted to have been able to get a player he believes can score regularly in the top flight.He said: \u0026#8220We tried to get him in January and I think we missed out by just a couple of hours.

He’s a good age, good experience and scored goals.“He’s the type of striker I’ve been looking for, he’s quick and gets down the sides of people,” he said.“He gets in between the sticks and that’s how he scores goals. One thing I like about him as well is that he’s got a very good work ethic because we are not the kind of team who can let people stand about.“There are a lot of strikers who bang in goals but I am not sure whether they have the work ethic to be my kind of player.“Jean ticked that box for me, he’s got good English and has played in a few countries so I think he will settle easily.”Meanwhile, young Dundee midfielder Jesse Curran has signed up for another year at Dens Park.The 21-year-old Australian has been in talks over a new deal for some time.He made eight top team appearances last term and manager Neil McCann was keen to hang on to him.Along with striker Matty Henvey, who penned a similar contract at the beginning of this week, the Dark Blues are looking for Curran to push for more game time in the coming campaign.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29a52ebfe-668x564.jpg ","title":"paralympian cyclist hannah thanks all who contributed to championship funds","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Paralympic cyclist, who found her passion while studying in Dundee, has crowd-funded enough money to enable her to compete – and also a surplus to help other cyclists.Hannah Dines, 25, who has cerebral palsy, was recently chosen for the Paracycling Road World Championships.

I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton. I still speak to Scott Bain and Nick Ross, too.”It was a mixed experience for Konrad working under manager Paul Hartley at Dens Park, however.“Paul Hartley was hard but fair, I would say.“He had his players, his top players who he would speak to all the time.“He wasn’t always easy, sometimes he would shout at me and Luka Tankulic for no reason but it was football, you live with that.\u0026#8220He played me 69 times in two years so I can’t complain.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b34f49e9224a-846x564.jpg ","title":"woman 85 says she could have been wiped out after teen ploughs car through dundee garden wall","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA teenager is being hunted by police after a car was stolen and ended up smashing into a garden wall in Dundee.The silver Peugeot 106 was seen to skid across the road before crashing through the wall in Mallaig Avenue in Gowrie Park just after 7am on Thursday.The Peugeot had been reported stolen from Sutherland Crescent, and police believe the same vehicle had been involved in a collision with a parked car in Forth Crescent five minutes earlier.Several people close to Mallaig Avenue heard a loud bang as the car crashed.Betty McMurchie, 85, of Applecross Gardens, said at first she assumed it was a neighbour putting their bins out.The retired shop worker said: “That spot is exactly where I stand to wait for the bus. If I was there I would have been wiped out.“It’s awful the damage that’s been done.”One motorist said the car was “totalled” and added: “The car has gone straight into the wall – you could see skid marks near to where the car appeared to lose control.“This area can be extremely busy so I’d imagine this would have caused a fair bit of chaos.”A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “Police Scotland is appealing for information about a number of linked incidents which happened in the Menzieshill area.“Firstly, a silver Peugeot 106 was stolen from outside an address in Sutherland Crescent sometime after 9.45pm on Wednesday.

Xplore does not own any at the moment, but it is understood the firm will try to secure “green” funding in order to buy them.Last month, Transport Scotland announced a £1.7 million Scottish Green Bus Fund – the eighth such fund it has launched to promote the use of eco-friendly public transport. Xplore could take advantage of such an offer in order to buy new stock.Councillors were briefed on the plans by Xplore last week.City development convener Lynne Short said: “It’s really exciting.

ARGH\u0027s request the Autistic Pride Day flag was flown at the Scottish Government HQ, St Andrews House in Edinburgh,\" she said.Mrs Brook believes that it is a day of celebration and a chance for autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco

appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s

Israeli medical technology firm Insightec has had the blessing of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) which advises British health authorities.Essential tremor (ET) and similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less nature of focused ultrasound, there is no risk of infection and patients recover quickly.Mary Ramsay (61), a lifelong ET sufferer, has had to travel 450 miles to Newcastle \u0026ndash but for an alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted.

And the Reds have also been linked with former Ross County striker Alex Schalk.“We’re light at the back so we need to get another defender in,” said McInnes.“That’s probably the area we’re concentrating on at the minute.“If you can’t always bring something better you can bring something different to the team.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country. STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern.

Road users will be sent on the usual lengthy diversion via the A819, A85 and the A82, though access will be maintained  for emergency vehicles.Following completion of the surfacing, further minor construction works to complete the project will take place ahead of the A83 opening to both lanes again later in July.Eddie Ross, of trunk road management company BEAR Scotland, said: \u0026#8216We thank motorists and the local community for their continued patience while teams work to complete the project.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12802034.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/swr_ayp_270318esther.jpg","title":"claims south ayrshire council poised","story":"NewsClaims that South Ayrshire Council poised to swoop on crumbling hotelCollapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley11:31, 27 JUN 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel (Image: ayrshire post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The council is poised to swoop on the Station Hotel to undertake emergency repairs it is claimed.  Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"waiting-list-created-as-traders-flock-to-selkirk-market","story":"ORGANISERS of the new Selkirk Farmers\u0027 Market have revealed there is already a waiting list for stalls.\nThe inaugural event took place at the start of the month.\nAnd many of the 15 traders had sold out of stock within hours of opening.\nAll 15 stalls have already been booked for the second Market on Saturday, July 7.\nSelkirkshire councillor Caroline Penman said: \"The first Market was a huge success and the feedback from stallholders as well as shoppers was extremely positive.\n\"Many of the stallholders immediately booked for the next month and we now have a waiting list.\"\nLocal organisations receive a boost from the monthly Market with Selkirk Rugby Club\u0027s junior section receiving \u0026pound300 for assembling and taking down the stalls.\nAnd next month it will be the turn of the Selkirk Silver Band to receive the rental donation.\nA further \u0026pound75 was also given to Scott\u0027s Selkirk following the June Market.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a-decade-of-singing-about-to-be-celebrated-in-peebles","story":"IT all began with an advertisement in the Peeblesshire News almost a decade ago.\nAndrew Russel, realising that contemporary choirs could be the next big thing, asked for anyone interested in singing as part of a community choir to pop into the Eastgate on September 2, 2008.\nHe expected around 30.\nWhat he got was around 130.\nEven after auditions had taken place, there were still over 100 members.\nAnd many of these founder members are still with this big choir today as it prepares for its 10th birthday celebrations.\nInChorus quickly became known -for their vibrant enthusiastic performances.\nThey were invited to sing at the public opening of the Scottish Parliament in May 2010.\nThe same year, they were asked by the American organisers of the September Concerts - a programme set up following the 9/11 atrocities to promote peace through music - to stage a concert on September 11, which took place at a packed Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and was streamed around the world.\nThis led to the choir travelling to New York to take part in the 10th anniversary commemorations of 9/11 in 2011.\nInChorus embarked on a huge fundraising programme for this and were blown away by the support they received from the community.\nOne fundraiser was a concert in the Usher Hall where they were joined by, among others, Mhairi Campbell and Dougie Maclean. InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716324091,16323237,16323170,16323072,16322769\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross. This twisting, single-track mountain road is the third highest road in Scotland rising up to 626 metres (2,054 ft) above the sea level. It\u0026rsquos one of the most scenic rides in the world, very similar to the great mountain passes in the Alps, with very tight hairpin bends which switch back and forth up the hillside, with gradients approaching 20 percent.\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest highlight however, and by far the most humbling, has been the generosity of people from far and wide.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew that setting a \u0026pound25,000 fundraising target was ambitious, however we never imagined we would get so close to it, with funds currently around \u0026pound21,000.\n\u0026ldquoEqually the generosity of people along the way and the support they afforded us was incredible.\n\u0026ldquoOn our last day whilst cycling down the A9 towards Inverness we were flagged down as we passed a layby by the owner of the Golspie fish and chip shop with 10 chip suppers to fuel us on our last 50 miles.\nTo donate, go to: https://bit.ly/2y4NauJ\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-galashiels-braw-lads-gathering-2018-highlights-wednesday-night","story":"MISSED any of the action from the festivities for the 2018 Galashiels Braw Lads Gathering?\nWatch our coverage of the events across the town on Wednesday evening (June 27) below...\nDon\u0027t forget to buy next week\u0027s Border  newspaper for photos and\u0026nbspfull reports\n"},{"url":null,"title":"post-office-launches-six-week-consultation-on-new-innerleithen-branch","story":"POST Office bosses have launched a six-week consultation on the new Innerleithen branch.\nThe move follows a confirmation of opening times for customers when the concession opens within The Allotment grocery store on Innerleithen High Street on Wednesday, August 29.\nUpon opening, the branch will open from 10am to 5pm between Monday to Friday, and from 9.30am to 1pm on Saturday.

The atmosphere here is just amazing.\u0026#8217Away from the World Cup frenzy taking place across the country, Michael described life and work in Peru’s capital, the third-largest city in the Americas.He said: \u0026#8216Lima is a crazy, bustling city.

I have practiced more and more with Carla as she speaks it fluently and I would like to become fluent too.’Back in football-mad Lima, Michael described the scene before Peru’s play-off win over Oceanian champions New Zealand last November, which sealed qualification.He said: \u0026#8216Peru\u0026#8217s fans knew they were one game away from the World Cup, and rightly or wrongly, did everything to help their team advance.\u0026#8216People set off fireworks and cars beeped their horns outside the New Zealand squad\u0026#8217s hotel in the early hours of the morning of the match.\u0026#8216When Peru won 2-0, there was pandemonium. It was as if they had won the World Cup.\u0026#8216Whole families were out on the streets enjoying the party atmosphere, grannies, parents with their young children, young people who can\u0026#8217t remember a World Cup with Peru in it.\u0026#8216That shows how proud they are to be there.’Despite the countries 1-0 defeat to Denmark in Saransk, Russia, \u0026#8211 in front of 40,000 travelling Peruvian fans, making them one of the best-supported nations at the tournament \u0026#8211 those back home were still kept in good spirits.Michael added: ‘No matter the result the massive street parties were going to continue.It was only 1pm local time and the football was finished, but there were marching bands, thousands of people chanting songs and TV cameras everywhere.‘Peru have at least two more matches to come (against France, at the time of writing, and Australia) and everyone will be back on the streets supporting the national team.‘Deep down the people know this might be a once-in-a-generation experience so they are determined to enjoy it as sport fans, and as proud Peruvians.’Michael Fee, farthest right, girlfriend Carla, second from right, and friends enjoy Peru’s World Cup party.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.  Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun asHarry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

On Thursday, Glasgow recorded its hottest day since records began as another sweltering day saw the temperature peak at 31.9C (89.4F).  The city beat Wednesday\u0026rsquos high of 31.3C (88.3F) in Aviemore in the Highlands, and came close to matching the hottest June day ever recorded in Scotland - 32.2C (89.9F) at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross in 1893.  As tens of thousands of music lovers flock to Glasgow for TRNSMT at Glasgow Green and Fiesta x Fold in Kelvingrove Park, revellers are being urged to stock up on sunscreen and water.  Temperatures in the city will dip slightly, but it will still be warm for the week ahead with plenty of sunshine and temperatures around the 25C mark.  The first hosepipe ban is likely to come into place in Northern Ireland this weekend.  Northern Ireland Water said demand is outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water.  Scottish Water said it is managing supplies across the country and will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Only two localised areas in Scotland have been issued with advice to \u0026ldquouse water wisely - parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  Other parts of the UK have urged water consumers to take simple steps to reduce the amount they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: \u0026ldquoWe are going to see a continuation of the current warm spell, but the temperatures over the next few days are not likely to be the warmest of the year so far.  \u0026ldquoI think, for now, temperatures have peaked and we are not expecting to see any records today.  \u0026ldquoWe will begin to have a slightly fresher feel, bringing the temperatures down, not by much, by one or two degrees.  Gritters have been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.  Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles.  Some railway tracks have soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend.  ScotRail customers have seen massive disruption across the Glasgow network for three days now as the railway lines buckle in the hot weather, with many speed restriction in place for train drivers.  The Met Office\u0026rsquos heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said.  The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires, including one in Bathgate.  The heat has already claimed casualties.  The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe just cannot emphasise enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned.  \u0026ldquoOur message is simple: please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.  The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.  The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days.  Parts of the Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.  A new moorland blaze - on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.  Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.  The RSPCA called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7996889.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"trnsmt-2018-bar-prices-at-glasgow-festival-revealed","story":"              THE bar prices have been revealed for TRNSMT festival.

With fellow EU leaders calling for quicker progress, the Prime Minister said: \"I look forward to speaking with fellow leaders about the very good progress we have made on the withdrawal agreement and looking forward to securing our strong future partnership, which is in the interests of both the European Union and the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoBoth sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that.\"  Mark Rutte, her Dutch counterpart, called for more progress on Brexit, saying: \"I am not losing patience but time is getting shorter and shorter to come to an agreement.\"  Referring to the March 29, 2019 Brexit date, he said: \"We don\u0027t have time much longer. I do understand it is difficult to come to an agreement within her Cabinet and the UK Parliament, but she has to.\"  As he arrived at the European Council in Brussels, Mr Rutte added that it was \"crucial\" to resolve the Irish border issue.  Asked if other EU leaders were telling Britain to \"get its act together\", Mrs May said: \"We have been setting out throughout these negotiations our position and, of course, at every stage - last December and in March - we have come to agreements with the European Union on the issues which we had discussed and agreed we would be talking about.  \"Now, we will be bringing the Cabinet together within the next week. We will be publishing a White Paper setting out in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future.\"  The PM stressed: \"That is a partnership which is not just about the interests of the UK, it\u0027s about the wider interests of the European Union as well. That\u0027s why I\u0027m confident we can sit down and discuss that at pace and ensure that we can achieve what we want, which is: that continuing partnership with the European Union on economic and security matters.\"  She made clear the UK had already been able to encourage and get flexibility from the EU on a number of matters and expressed confidence a good Brexit deal could be agreed.  \"Because this isn\u0027t just about the United Kingdom it\u0027s about ensuring that we have a partnership that works for us and a partnership that works for us will work for the EU as well,\" added Mrs May.  Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, admitted he was \"worried\" about a lack of progress but stressed that he would not \"lecture\" the PM, noting, however, that the UK had to make its position clear.  Asked if there was a risk there may not be a deal, he replied: \"We are preparing for different scenarios on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the no deal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"salaries-for-scottish-university-graduates-highest-in-uk","story":"              SCOTTISH graduates earn more than their counterparts across the rest of the UK.  New figures show the average salary of Scottish graduates was \u0026pound23,500 in 2016/17 - \u0026pound500 more than students leaving university in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The highest salaries of \u0026pound33,500 were earned by graduates from medicine and dentistry, followed by the \u0026pound30,000 for those who studied social studies, engineering or mathematical science.  The lowest salaries for Scottish graduates was the \u0026pound21,000 for those who studied creative art and design.  The figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, come after the \u0026ldquoobsession of teachers and parents with a university degree was questioned in recent weeks.  Sir Ian Wood, a philanthropist and former Wood Group chief executive, said parents and teachers pressurised pupils to go to university without knowing whether it was the best option for them.  And he called for a greater focus on the importance of vocational qualifications - as well as a campaign to highlight successful and lucrative careers outside the traditional professions.  The new figures were welcomed by universities and the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).  David Lott, deputy director of Universities Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThese figures demonstrate that graduates from Scottish universities continue to be highly valued by employers across the country, both as new graduates and as they move through their careers.  \u0026ldquoSalary is not the only way to judge the success of a graduate, but as graduations take place the length and breadth of Scotland over the coming weeks, those students can be assured that the hard work they have undertaken will be highly valued in the labour market.  John Kemp, interim chief executive of the SFC, added: \u0026ldquoThis is good news and comes on top of last week\u0026rsquos news that five years after graduation, students leaving Scotland\u0026rsquos universities can expect to earn higher salaries than their counterparts in other parts of Britain."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7992242.jpg?type=article-full","title":"cash-machines-shutting-down-in-scotland-at-a-rate-of-eight-a-week","story":"              CASH machines are shutting down at a rate of eight a week in Scotland raising new worries about how people access their money.  New UK-wide research from consumer organisation Which? has revealed that while there are concerns over the rate of bank branch closures across the country, Scotland\u0027s rural communities are being worst hit by ATM closures.  Which? said their report casts doubt pledges made by Link, the UK\u0027s largest cash machine network, to protect access to cash in rural areas.  But Which? said that its research based on Link data shows that there was a net loss of 146 cashpoints in Scotland between November, last year and the end of March this year - 2.2 per cent of the network. There are now 6,367 machines in the Scottish network with around 5,400 free to use.  The Which? research appears to contradict a statement made by Link chairman Sir Mark Boleat to MSPs two weeks ago that the current figure for open ATMs in Scotland \"is probably the highest it has ever been\" and that \"there has been no reduction in number\". While the UK lost two per cent of its Link machines, Scotland\u0027s rural network was hardest hit with 49 shut - a 2.9 per cent net loss.  It comes two weeks after separate research revealed that bank branches have closed at a rate of two a week in Scotland over the last four years.  According to Which?, Scotland was the worst hit area in the UK for bank branches shut or scheduled to close between 2015 and 2018.    The study comes after it was revealed that Scotland faces being one of the worst affected areas of the UK as plans to cut fees for card machine operators are set to sound the death knell on thousands of \u0026lsquohole-in-the-wall\u0026rsquo machines.  July 1 marks the start of a phased cut in the fee Link receives from banks per transaction from 25p to 20p.  Link has said that up to ten per cent of the 5,400 free-to-use ATMs in Scotland could be lost as a result.  Link had previously guaranteed that ATMs which were more than 1km from the nearest alternative cash-point would not be subject to the controversial cut.  Which? say closures have accelerated as operators began to learn of the fee-cutting plans.  A Which? spokesman said: \"The findings suggest that ATM operators have already decided measures designed to protect access to cash in more remote areas are insufficient and seem to run contrary to Link\u0027s promises that it will do \u0026ldquowhatever it takes to maintain ATM provision.  \"While digital payments are increasing, we are concerned that not enough is being done to preserve consumers\u0026rsquo access to cash payments, which are still relied upon by 2.7 million people across the UK.  \"UK Finance recently found that cash accounted for just over a third of all payments in 2017, showing it is still vital to millions of people.  \"Which? is concerned that Link\u0026rsquos decision was simply waved through by the regulator without considering the impact on consumers.  \"With fresh evidence of the negative impact these funding changes are having on the network, Which? is calling on the regulator to halt Link\u0026rsquos cuts, before more communities lose their ATMs.\"  Which? said that across the UK cash machines are closing at a rate of 300 every month.    Some 1,500 machines closed between November, last year and the end of March this year marking a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015.  One of the largest independent ATM providers, NoteMachine, said learning of the changes in late 2017 had \u0026ldquoan immediate effect on its ability to maintain widespread free access, while the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) said the move set the network on \u0026ldquoa path to disaster.  Harry Rose of Which? said: \u0026ldquoWith hundreds of cashpoints closing every month we have serious concerns that, far from protecting consumers\u0026rsquo access to cash, LINK\u0026rsquos plans risk destroying it.  \u0026ldquoThese cuts could see millions of people who rely on cash in their daily lives struggling through these closures - with severe consequences for many Scottish communities and businesses.\"  Ged Killen, the Labour MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West who is introducing bill at Westminster to protect the free-to-use network said the findings were \"deeply concerning\".    He said: \"Rural Scotland has suffered the worst of these reductions and there are now real fears we could see cash machine deserts created across the country.  \u0026ldquoLINK has so far failed to meet its promises and it is time for the regulator (the PSR) to seriously look at stepping in.  Link insists that the number of free-to-use ATMs has increased across the UK and questioned the methodology.  But Which? said it stood by its research and have been told by ATM operators that, if anything, it may underestimate the true number of closures.  A Link spokesman said: \"Over the last 10 years cash payments have fallen by 33 per cent, during the same period free ATM numbers have grown 18,000 (50%). This disconnect is not sustainable and needs addressing now to protect Link and future access to cash for consumers,\" said a Link spokesman.  \"In the period between Jan \u0026amp June 2018 cash withdrawal volumes were down six per cent on the same period last year.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-hails-20bn-frigate-deal-as-biggest-naval-defence-contract-for-decade","story":"              THERESA May has hailed a shipbuilding contract worth up to \u0026pound20 billion between BAE Systems and the Australian Government as the biggest naval defence contract for a decade.  She suggested this was a \u0026ldquoperfect illustration of Global Britain, clinching a lucrative deal as the country embarked on life beyond the European Union.  BAE Systems has been chosen as the preferred bidder for the SEA 5000 Future Frigate, beating off competition from Italy and Spain.  The UK company will build nine warships in Adelaide with a design based on Britain\u0026rsquos Type 26 Global Combat Ship the first export of a British design for new-build frigates since the 1970s.  No 10 explained the agreement would secure more than 4000 jobs in Australia and also boost Britain\u0026rsquos export economy for generations to come.  In turn, it said it was hoped that the contract would also benefit the UK economy with exports having the potential to drive regional growth, create new jobs and showcase the strength of British innovation on the world stage.  The multi-billion pound deal is the result of four years of intensive Government engagement involving a number of departments across Whitehall.  The Prime Minister has been directly involved in making the case for the UK bid, including in bilateral talks with her Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull at Chequers earlier this year.  Over the past 18 months Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, have all visited Australia to extol the benefits of Britain\u0026rsquos world-class design, engineering and innovation.  \u0026ldquoThe sheer scale and nature of this contract puts the UK at the very forefront of maritime design and engineering and demonstrates what can be achieved by UK industry and Government working hand-in-hand, declared Mrs May.  \u0026ldquoWe have always been clear that as we leave the EU we have an opportunity to build on our close relationships with allies like Australia. This deal is a perfect illustration that the Government is doing exactly that.  \u0026ldquoAnd while this is an enormous boost for the UK economy, it will also cement our strategic partnership with one of our oldest and closest friends for decades to come, she added.  Dr Fox pointed out how the UK and Australia already enjoyed a strong trading relationship worth more than \u0026pound13 billion a year.  \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement is a further boost to this relationship, which will create significant opportunities for companies in both countries to deepen their trading ties.  These opportunities, the International Trade Secretary explained, included increased data and information sharing, high-end technology transfer, and collaboration at the cutting-edge of maritime expertise.  Downing Street also pointed out how the new contract would build on the century-long ties between the two nations and would allow \u0026ldquointeroperability between Australian and Royal Navy ships amid a climate of intensifying threats around the world, especially in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions.  The 6,900 tonne multi-mission warships are designed to support anti-submarine warfare and a whole range of other operations anywhere in the world. They will form a key part of Australia\u0026rsquos hugely respected Navy.  The contract was secured with the UK committed to getting eight of the Type 26 warfare frigates, which are currently in-build on the River Clyde and are set to enter service with the Royal Navy in the 2020s.  Charles Woodburn for BAE Systems added: \u0026ldquoI am proud that our world class anti-submarine warfare design and our approach to transferring technology and skills to the nations in which we work is expected to contribute to the development of an enduring world-class naval shipbuilding industry in Australia."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7992962.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jan-patience-the-end-may-be-nigh-for-glasgow-school-of-arts-mackintosh-building","story":"              If buildings could talk, The Mack could tell you some stories. But this latest chapter in its chequered history takes some beating.  For over a century this majestic building which sits on a hill off Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0027s cultural life. It\u0027s no exaggeration to say that Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0027s Art Nouveau masterwork has fostered some of the brightest and most creative talents Scotland has ever produced.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago. Now, with the news that large sections of The Mack will be \"dismantled\" within days following a second inferno two weeks ago, it looks like the end is nigh for The Mack.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being burned to a crisp. It was late on a Friday night \u0026ndash graduation day as it happened for Glasgow School of Art\u0027s latest cohort of students \u0026ndash when the fire was first noticed by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire. The flames licked over to the adjacent O2 ABC venue and soon its roof caved had in like a sunken blancmange.  Today, all around The Mack\u0027s majestic teetering walls, there is both physical and mental turmoil. Since that fateful night, people have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street. Businesses in the immediate vicinity have been locked out, with business owners and staff facing penury. Crowdfunding campaigns have even been started by small non-funded creative business based in the nearby CCA on Sauchiehall Street looking for financial help to pay staff.  Yesterday, First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed during First Minister\u0027s Questions at Holyrood that a hardship fund to help people forced from their homes thanks to a safety cordon around the building will give \u0026pound1,500 to residents affected which will be matched by Glasgow City Council.  In the immediate aftermath of the fire the painter, Alison Watt, who graduated from GSA in the late 1980s and whose artist father James also graduated from the art school in the 1950s, talked on national radio about her intense feelings of loss on hearing that The Mack had been engulfed by flames yet again.  Turner Prize winning artist and GSA alumni, Douglas Gordon, flew back to Scotland from his home in Paris to see \"the corpse of the Mackintosh\". He speaks for many former students and staff when he added, \"part of my life has been cut out.\"  It all feels so distant from the cold February day last year when Gordon led me on a tour of the empty Mack for a feature in The Herald magazine. \"It [The Mack] was a place of real freedom,\" he told me. \"I haven\u0027t lived in Glasgow for nearly 30 years but it all feels really immediate. I feel both nostalgic and melancholic all at the same time.\"  While we were there, Gordon picked up a couple of pieces of green plaster from the floor which had fallen off one of the studio walls. \"Here, take this,\" he whispered conspiratorially. I still have these shards of green plaster from The Mack. They are sitting winking at me as I write.  In the two weeks since the Mack fire, mark two, I have watched as people\u0027s feelings turned from shock to anger. I have read accusations of mismanagement on the art school\u0027s part and rumours that there was inadequate insurance in place.  A statement put out by the Glasgow School of Art the day after put it so baldly, the Mackintosh Building had been undergoing a period or extensive restoration following the fire in 2014 \u0027and therefore has not been a part of the GSA\u0027s operational campus for four years.\"  The blame game started immediately in the media and on social media. All over my virtual world \u0026ndash admittedly filled with people linked to the creative community in Scotland \u0026ndash there has been much wailing and gnashing of teeth. People are livid and looking for someone to blame.  Where was the sprinkler system in the renovated building, people asked? That same question was asked four years ago and the same people feel they didn\u0027t get answers.  Leading GSA-trained architect, Alan Dunlop, prompted anger when he suggested that The Mack should be demolished and an international competition be launched to create a new building with the same spirit. Mackintosh was an innovator, he said, and he would not have wanted a facsimile\u0026hellip  Since Mackintosh isn\u0027t around to give his view, we will never know.    Friday\u0027s cartoon by Steven Camley  Labour MP Paul Sweeney, who is director of the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, was one of the first public figures to be allowed behind the cordon around The Mack after the fire. His observations that the walls were still solid led to some optimism in among the initial gloom. Last night, he said he was \u0026ldquoopen minded about holding a public inquiry, but insisted there first needed to be more clarity about how the fire started.  So what was it that was so special about The Mack? In my eyes, it was like the most charismatic lover you\u0027d ever been with \u0026ndash or never been with. I\u0027d have given anything to have been one of the thousands of students who passed through these magical swing doors in Mackintosh\u0027s famous elongated art nouveau script with the words ART (on the in door) and SCHOOL (on the out door).  I visited it as a sixteen-year-old and fell in love on the spot with the place. How could I not, with these doors and that library? When I went home to Ayrshire and told my normally mild-mannered dad I wanted to apply to get go to this magical place, he swiftly put the kibosh on the idea. \"But how would you get a job as an artist,\" he spluttered?  As it turned out, getting a job as anything in the 1980s was going to be hard but if my subsequent degree in English and Scottish Literature had any use, it led me (eventually) into writing about art. And that meant I got to visit The Mack as an almost-insider.  As one alumni and former member of GSA\u0027s management staff wrote to me in the wee sma\u0027 hours of June 16: \"We all smoked in the building and had done so for decades. Stamping cigarettes out on timber floors surrounded by white spirit. Rennie, the librarian, was a chronic chain smoker in his wee office in the library. Maybe this is too much information, but I\u0027m probably one of many who made love in the building. This latest news is death.\"  The fixtures and fittings rescued from the last fire at GSA remain off-site. Its beautiful library had been rebuilt and is sitting in a warehouse in Edinburgh. Like a confused child piece waiting for a home.  I sent the painter Alison Watt a message last night asking her what one thing she\u0027d like to tell The Mack.  Almost instantly, she wrote back: \"You continue to live inside all of us who love you.\""},{"url":null,"title":"calls-to-locate-new-glasgow-school-of-art-building-in-citys-east-end","story":"              Local councillors have made a unusual suggestion about the future of the Mackintosh building.  As the next steps for the Glasgow School of Art\u0027s famous building remain uncertain, Glasgow politicians have suggested recreating the structure in the city\u0027s East End.  Martin McElroy and Maureen Burke both claim the Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed building could be a boon to areas of regeneration.  One wants to see the building moved to Dennistoun while the other suggests Easterhouse would be a welcoming home.  Mr McElroy, the Labour party\u0027s representative in Springburn/Robroyston ward, said: \u0026ldquoLike all Glaswegians I was saddened to see the damage that this fire has caused to one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.  \u0026ldquoIf it cannot be saved and needs to be rebuilt we should look at locating the new Glasgow School of Art in a part of the city that requires regeneration.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of gap sites in the north and east of the city that would be suitable and could provide a huge boost to an area that needs it.\"  The politician believes cash to take down and rebuild the building - known as the Mack - could come from the sale of the land it currently sits on.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe land in Garnethill is potentially very valuable and could offset some of the costs associated with a rebuild as well.  \u0026ldquoBecause of the world famous nature of our School of Art we could potentially be talking about regenerating an entire neighbourhood.  \u0026ldquoAs a proud son of Glasgow, I am certain that this is something that Charles Rennie Mackintosh would be happy to have as the next phase of his legacy.  Building control experts have inspected the building in the wake of the fire to determine whether it could be saved.  Initial possibilities included another restoration project, estimated at around \u0026pound100 million or taking the remaining structure down and rebuilding it brick by brick on the current site, which could cost as much as \u0026pound200 million, according to construction experts.  Nicola Sturgeon said after visiting the site that the Scottish Government was ready to do \u0026ldquoanything we reasonably can to ensure the Mackintosh Building has a future.  Maureen Burke, Labour councillor for the North East ward, suggested Easterhouse as a potential new home for the Mack.  The area has undergone extensive regeneration, including the building of arts centre The Bridge.  Ms Burke said: \u0026ldquoAs every politician and member of the public would say, it is really sad what has happened.  \u0026ldquoIf they can save the building, that is great.  \u0026ldquoIf it is the case they need to look at rebuilding it, as a councillor for the north and east end of the city, we should be looking at other options and this could be one.  \u0026ldquoThere is a lot of regeneration happening on this side of the city.  \u0026ldquoIf you look at The Bridge, no one thought that would work but now it is thriving.  \u0026ldquoEasterhouse has various plots of vacant land available and we should be looking at that as an option."},{"url":null,"title":"stereophonics-to-kick-off-trnsmt-festival","story":"              Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest music festival will kick off on Friday with performances by the Stereophonics and James Bay.

Holyrood\u0027s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee is examining the Bill and has produced a survey to collect public views.

The Mack\u0027s interior was bathed in light, boasting huge plains of space, artists often remarked.  It had almost ideal studios for drawing and painting, and other, smaller spaces for private contemplation and study.  And a basement lecture theatre with its uncomfortable timber benches, where everything and everyone, felt close and intimate.  And, after degree shows - which often felt rather cramped and chaotic in the studio spaces - it was also a venue, perhaps, for some after-hours celebrations.  Even then, if you were toting a glass of white wine past the red-stickered artworks of young artists on their way to the world outside its walls, it was easy to feel that year\u0026rsquos graduating class was part of a continuum of art making \u0026ndash in sculpture, paint, pencil, watercolour and oils \u0026ndash stretching back to Mackintosh himself.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot that he just designed the building, there was more: it was the light fixtures, some of the furniture, the library, the clocks, the windows, Mr Gray said.  It was at the heart of generations of artists\u0027 lives, intimately so. Many speak of it like an old friend, or much-loved relative, or nurturing home, and its loss a personal bereavement.  Now fire has extinguished the light and the space for art is only ruin.  For Gray, the Mackintosh Building, where he studied painting, was an historical monument, too, to a singular talent.  Yesterday he quoted the film maker and writer Timothy Neat, who once said Mackintosh showed in his most famous building that he had enough talent, he could have \u0026ldquodesigned a civilisation.  Mr Gray added: \u0026ldquoThere were three great architects at the beginning of the 19th century: Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago, [Antoni] Gaudi in Barcelona, Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoThey were the figures, doing new and exciting work, finding a new style to counter the Victorians, even though Glasgow did not get the support he needed in Glasgow, and was even black-balled from arts clubs.  \u0026ldquoBut all there is left of his work now is the Hill House in Helensburgh, Scotland Street School \u0026ndash which is not even a school anymore but a museum which shows you what a school looks like \u0026ndash and of course the church in Maryhill. This fire, it is rotten for Glasgow.  This week Professor Ray McKenzie, an honorary professor at Glasgow School of Art, told Artforum that in the building, Mackintosh had kept the balance of \u0026ldquobeauty, durability and fitness for purpose in perfect equilibrium. He added: \u0026ldquoAfter 34 years teaching in the Mack I never once tired of its life-enhancing generosity as a design, its continual reaffirmation of the \u0026lsquopoetics of architecture.  Martin Boyce, the Turner Prize winning artist and alumni of the school, spoke this week to Frieze online that the building was magical.  He added: \u0026ldquoTo enter through those swing doors marked \u0026lsquoIn\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoOut\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoArt\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoSchool\u0026rsquo was to enter a place of art.  \u0026ldquoWith the exception of a small office halfway up the main stairwell, I never had any sense of administration. It seemed to be all bright studios and dark stairwells, a jewel-like library and the \u0026lsquoHen Run\u0026rsquo corridor.  Karla Black, another notable alumni and Turner Prize nominee, said that she can walk through the whole building in her head, \u0026ldquoalong the Hen Run, see the graffiti on the hard, uncomfortable benches in the Mackintosh Lecture Theatre, walk up the stairs to the museum.  She noted: \u0026ldquoI loved it. I would sit in the old library, reading and staring at it, thinking \u0026lsquoI can\u0026rsquot believe I\u0026rsquom allowed to be in here\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoMy memories of the building are visceral and physical: my hand flat on the brass plate of the big, black, wooden swing doors, marked \u0026lsquoIn\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoOut\u0026rsquo in Art Nouveau font.

The SNP Government yesterday announced it was giving the money to Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited (FMEL), despite questions over its financial disclosures.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the money would provide \u0026ldquoworking capital for the Clyde shipbuilder alongside private investment intended to help diversify the business.  The Port Glasgow yard was acquired by billionaire Jim McColl, a member of the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers, after it went into administration in 2014.  However it has been flagged on the Companies House website for not yet filing its annual accounts for 2016, which were due by September 2017.  The most recent public accounts are for the year ending December 2015.  Its immediate parent company, Ferguson Marine Engineering (Holdings) Ltd, is also nine months overdue filing its annual accounts, according to the Companies House website.  Ferguson Marine last night said it had an approval for late filing, but did not explain why it needed it - extensions are normally granted for events outwith a company\u0026rsquos control.  There is no public record of a late filing approval on the Companies House website. Both firms are ultimately owned by Mr McColl\u0026rsquos Clyde Blowers empire.  Green MSP John Finnie said: \u0026ldquoTransparency is vital when public funds are concerned, and this substantial loan must be held up to scrutiny.  \u0026ldquoShip servicing and repair, low carbon marine projects and decommissioning work are all very worthy but it\u0026rsquos clearly a concern if public funds are being used to support a company with a chequered history.  Mr Mackay said one of Mr McColl\u0026rsquos investment vehicles, Clyde Blowers Capital, would also invest alongside the loan to diversify the yard\u0026rsquos work.  Mr McColl recently spoke of expanding into green energy.  The year after Mr McColl acquired Ferguson\u0026rsquos it won a \u0026pound97m contract to build two new \u0026lsquodual fuel\u0026rsquo ferries for government-owned CalMac, securing work for the 150 staff.  However the contract has not gone smoothly, with the first vessel delayed from May this year to the winter, despite Mr McColl assuring ministers in early 2017 that it would be on time.  Ferguson Marine finance director Tom Cousins said: \u0026ldquoThis loan will allow us to accelerate our diversification into areas of innovation in green energy and marine transport and other opportunities such as decommissioning, on which where we are well-place to capitalise.  \u0026ldquoWe have approval from Companies House for the extension on the filing of our accounts. This was not a government bail-out. The investment alongside Clyde Blowers Capital is to support continued diversification.  Mr Mackay said: \u0026ldquoCommercial shipbuilding on the Clyde has a long and proud history, and it is essential that we continue to support this important industry and help it reach its full potential.  \u0026ldquoThis investment allows FMEL to further diversify their business by moving into innovative areas, like low-carbon marine projects, and target decommissioning work.  \u0026ldquoThe loan is a strategic investment in our industrial capability as both the marine engineering sector and commercial shipbuilding have vital roles to play in Scotland\u0026rsquos future."},{"url":null,"title":"on-your-bike-new-push-to-give-children-access-to-safer-cycling-schemes","story":"              A new drive is being made to help thousands of schoolchildren learn to cycle safely.  Retail chain Halfords and the Bikeability Trust, the national charity for cycling training, have launched a partnership to help 25,000 more children of primary school age in England access safe cycling programmes.  The initiative follows a survey commissioned by Halfords, which shows that 56% of parents want cycling safety added to the national curriculum so that all children will be taught to cycle competently, and proficiently on the roads.  The research also found that a third of parents think there should be a special cycling highway code for children, and one in eight families with under 12s have at least one member who does not know how to ride a bike.  Halfords will provide free bike safety checks for every child taking part in a Bikeability programme, as well as for their parents, teachers and trainers.

Some railway tracks have soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend.  Trains had to be stopped from running over a section of track near\u0026nbspCarlisle station on Thursday.  Speed restrictions have been in place all week on the route from London Waterloo to New Malden due to the scorching temperatures, causing delays to services.  Translink Rail services also felt the heat as they were forced to delay and cancel services across Northern Ireland on Thursday as rail lines reached over 50C and began to buckle.  The Met Office\u0026rsquos heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said.  Public Health England issued a warning saying the extreme heat may pose a risk to the most vulnerable.  The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires.  The heat has already claimed casualties.

They said: \u0026ldquoWe just cannot emphasis enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned.  \u0026ldquoOur message is simple, please don\u0026rsquot do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.\u0026nbsp  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.  The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.  The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.

Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing.

Sue Ryder Dee View Court is currently home to 24 people living with complex and long-term conditions, with a waiting list double this amount.        The appeal has already reached £2.2million, with the charity now encouraging community fundraisers to set their targets in £1,000 segments, or ‘bricks’ as part of the Brick by Brick campaign - each £1,000 raised equates to one brick in the new centre. Emma Leiper Finlayson, Capital Appeal Manager for Sue Ryder Dee View Court said: “There’s a desperate need for unified neurological care in Scotland and our waiting list increases all the time.  We urgently need to expand, and our Dee View appeal is the first step in Sue Ryder’s strategy to care for more people who need help to live well and thrive across Scotland.“Since launching the appeal, we have been overwhelmed and delighted with the response from the community. In particular, the Brick by Brick initiative, which has been a fantastic platform to engage local companies and schools in some fun and creative fundraising. By buying a brick for the extension they are quite literally helping us build brighter futures for people in their community.“Of course, our residents have been involved in the appeal too, with one recently taking part in the Aberdeen Kiltwalk with her family, whilst other residents have encouraged their friends and family to undertake challenges, such as the Great Aberdeen Run.

Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

Universal Credit replaces six benefits with one monthly payment and is already being claimed by single jobseekers. And from today, people who would previously have made a claim to Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income support, Working and Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit will instead claim Universal Credit.        A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work. We know it’s working – with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. “And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way. From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.

The new system is also more flexible, which means people can take on short-term work to develop their skills and build up their experience. “Our staff are trained to support people throughout the claim process. We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment.

He said that those who qualified for funding aid had to jump through hoops to get it.\u0026ldquoFuneral costs are going through the roof and it\u0026rsquos a hard struggle to make ends meet \u0026ndash especially when you\u0026rsquore already devastated by the death of a relative, he said.\u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquore in employment, you will get no help from the government and you will have to meet all the costs.\u0026ldquoHowever, if you are on an income-related benefit \u0026ndash be it sickness or unemployment \u0026ndash you are in a position to make a claim for cremation fees.\u0026ldquoBut it is not easy to obtain this.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future.

The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds.

The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Saturday 30 Jun 2018 2:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Saturday 30 Jun 2018 2:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760309.1530088555!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin reshuffle was long overdue but when it came it was dramatic","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tNicola Sturgeon\u0026#8217s reshuffle may have been a long time coming, but when it did come it was nothing if not dramatic, writes Tom Peterkin\t\t\t\tSix ministers have gone and there is the possibility of more casualties tomorrow when the First Minister finalises her junior ministerial team.            In the relatively brief history of devolution, one has to go back to Jack McConnell’s reshuffle of November 2001 to find one of comparable ferocity. Then, five senior and two junior ministers went in a reshuffle that earned the then Labour first minister the nickname “Jack the Knife”. Mr (now Lord) McConnell wielded the axe within hours of taking the top job. In contrast, it has taken Ms Sturgeon months, if not years, to carry out a similar exercise.            Yesterday’s reshuffle was long overdue. For many months now a somewhat tired-looking ministerial team had seemed to struggle to get a grip on domestic issues. In some ways that feeling of drift was typified yesterday with the Scottish Government having to deal with news on cancer waiting times and Education Secretary John Swinney shelving key education legislation.As Ms Sturgeon’s right hand man, Mr Swinney was always going to be safe from yesterday’s blood-letting. The same was not true of her good friend, Health Secretary Shona Robison. Ms Robison has been a lame duck struggling to swim against a tide of poor NHS performance indicators. As was clear from her resignation letter, Ms Robison has also had some very difficult personal issues to contend with. In those circumstances, it is perhaps easy to understand why she would want some time away from the pressure cooker environment of Cabinet politics. Ms Sturgeon will be sad to see the departure of one of her oldest friends in politics. But the truth is a fresh face is desperately needed at what is always one of the trickiest portfolios for a government.• READ MORE: Scottish Government Cabinet Reshuffle: Who’s in and Who’s out?            All sorts of spin can be spun about Keith Brown moving into an enhanced depute role with the SNP, but the reality is that Scotland’s economic growth is still lagging behind the rest of the UK. Mr Brown is a casualty of the decision to put his brief under Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s umbrella – a change that seems entirely sensible. Angela Constance’s departure is perhaps not unexpected with her post going to former public health minister Aileen Campbell. Of the promotions, Humza Yousaf faces a tough job as Justice Secretary. That is clear given the challenges that Michael Matheson has faced, having to get to grips with the dysfunctional nature of Police Scotland. Mr Yousaf has shown himself to be a politician of determination in his handling of the notoriously tricky transport brief – which now goes to Mr Matheson, who remains in the Cabinet. Jeane Freeman, who in a previous life was a Labour adviser, has long been seen as a politician destined for the Cabinet. She has the unenviable task of taking over the health brief that always proves so difficult no matter who is in charge.             So far Ms Freeman has proved herself relatively sure-footed, aside from an episode last year when she was accused of making a clumsy attempt at smearing a nurse in a TV debate.The return of Michael Russell is an indication of Brexit looming on the horizon, while Shirley Anne Somerville faces the intimidating task of setting up Scotland’s social security system."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4761886.1530279762!/image/image.jpg","title":"queensferry crossing works to cause traffic misery over summer","story":"\t\tSnagging work on the trouble hit Queensferry Crossing will continue all through summer, transports chiefs revealed yesterday.\t\t\t\tIt will spell frustration for motorists forced to endure tailbacks getting on and off the new bridge.

The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hotel chain sets its sights on up and coming destination lerwick ","story":"\nTravelodge has written to the SIC to ask about potential development sites.\nShetland is one of 20 areas identified by the firm, as the chain looks to expand across Scotland.\nAccording to Travelodge, they have written to the SIC to propose a \u0026#8220joint development partnership\u0026#8221 to finance a new hotel in Shetland, which they claim will unlock \u0026#8220development potential in the isles\u0026#8221.\nBut the council\u0026#8217s communications department said that the authority could not yet comment on the proposals because the letter had not arrived.\nThe firm announced plans for expansion on Monday as its newest hotel, located in Stirling city centre, opened.\nTravelodge\u0026#8217s plans have seen them write to 20 local authorities across Scotland, with Kirkwall in Orkney also on the firm\u0026#8217s radar.\nIf successful the company claims the expansion will represent an investment of £125 million and could create 385 new jobs.\nAccording to the chain, the letter to the SIC outlines how it has worked alongside 12 local authorities in England and Wales to create jobs and boost the economy.\nTravelodge believes it can do the same for Shetland, which it has identified as an \u0026#8220up-and-coming tourist destination\u0026#8221, and in doing so help the council to achieve its aims of increasing visitor numbers.\nAgreements between the hotel chain and local authorities have had unique funding structures, Travelodge said. Hotels have been built on surplus local authority land, with funding provided either through internal council resources, the Public Works Loan Board or third-party resources.\nUpon completion, local authorities can choose to either retain ownership of the hotel, receiving an annual rent, or sell the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.\nTravelodge chairman Brian Wallace said: \u0026#8220Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.\u0026#8221\nHe added: \u0026#8220We want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Lerwick. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Shetland Islands Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.\u0026#8221\n \u0026raquo\nHope it\u0026#8217s cleaner than the one in Bridge St / union St  Aberdeen\nI\u0026#8217d hope it would be staffed by locals here and they would have more pride in their work, saying that ive been in London Edinburgh Glasgow and Aberdeen ones and they have always been spotless\nSo, Travelodge wants to build a bland uninspiring hotel in Shetland and it wants SIC to pay for it. Really ? I think they are taking the ****. How about, they discuss with SIC and the existing Shetland tourism providers to see if another hotel is needed and if so, they pay for it. If they have a good business case they should have no problem is raising the necessary funds for the venture.\nI would suggest that people interested in the Travelodge empire google Travelodge owners .  It quickly becomes evident that it is a huge money making business which is definitely not in need of financial support from Shetland.  What a nerve these people have.  They may argue that a hotel in the Isles would be beneficial and it would be ————- to their enormous assets.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.
