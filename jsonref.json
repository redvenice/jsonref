They may have stopped recruiting patients because the risk of Covid-19 infection in hospitals was too high.Some 10 per cent - 1,500 - were shut down all together.It is unclear currently the exact reasons why each was stopped, but possible reasons include the research being time sensitive or they did not have enough money to wait until after the outbreak, for example.  Dr Head told MailOnline: \u0027I guess looking back and reflecting, the numbers are not surprising. The pandemic has taken the world by surprise. \u0027We\u0027ve shown globally and in the UK we are not prepared, and that will impact on research. \u0027Research is directed towards Covid-19, which is necessary. But obviously that will impact on other areas of health. In terms of preparedness for the future, we need to make sure non-Covid types of research are in planning.\u0027The research is ongoing and so it is unclear exactly what areas have been impacted the most. This will become clearer over the next few months.Dr Head said: \u0027It might be that cancer research was not affected but stroke and mental health was. It won\u0027t just be large diseases, but areas of health with few cases.\u0027There will be research impacted that what will be rare or orphan diseases, where there isn\u0027t much treatment available. \u0027Aspects of that might include motor neurone disease or haemophilia. If they are impacted it might hard for those charities to carry on.\u0027He added that it will be important to discover what knowledge would have been found had Covid-19 not halted medical research.These \u0027knowledge gaps\u0027 will be important for moving forward in the treatment of patients, he said.Dr Head told The Observer: \u0027This pandemic has knocked everything off track. Research gives us the knowledge we need to tackle illnesses in new ways, and if that doesn\u0027t happen all areas of health will suffer.\u0027 A stark example of the harm caused to medical research by the pandemic is to cancer research, as large charities have revealed the devastation in stark numbers.  \u0027We had planned to spend £400m on research this year. That figure will have to be cut to £250m,\u0027 Aoife Regan of Cancer Research UK told the Observer.\u0027That is £150m of research on treatments with the potential to save or lengthen lives that will not now take place.\u0027If cuts continue to persist for four or five more years, it would mean hundreds of millions of pounds will be stripped from cancer research in the UK in coming years which will \u0027send ripples beyond that\u0027. The impact of Covid-19 on cancer patients has been at the forefront of discussions during the pandemic. Dame Laura Lee, the chief executive of cancer charity Maggie\u0027s, today said the past few months have been a difficult time for cancer patients.Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, she said: \u0027It\u0027s been hugely difficult. Cancer is not just a physical illness but it\u0027s the psychological effects that has not just on the person but also the family.\u0027With auto treatments and on many occasions treatment being ceased, people with cancer dying during this period, or finding that their disease has progressed, it\u0027s been a heightened time of distress and anxiety.\u0027Cancer always brings anxiety, a sense of aloneness, but during this Covid time, it\u0027s been higher than ever. \u0027People are coming into our centres with that knowledge and information of what they\u0027ve heard and worrying, what does that mean for me?\u0027Our centre staff have never said they\u0027ve ever dealt with such level of distress, feelings of anger, about the situation they find themselves in and actually, to a certain extent, feelings of abandonment with the NHS as well.\u0027 Shannon Amoils, of the British Heart Foundation, said its research had \u0027ground to a halt\u0027 during the pandemic. A study at Edinburgh University was set to determine if specific drugs could prevent stroke patients from going on to develop vascular dementia. Another study at Newcastle University aimed to find out if non-invasive treatments could be used instead of surgical interventions for elderly men and women who had suffered heart attacks. Brian Dickie, of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, warned time was critical for the research of motor neuron diseases - which affect about 5,000 people in the UK.He said: \u0027Around 50 per cent of people with motor neurone disease will die within 18 months of their first diagnosis.\u0027Work to determine whether a drug called Tudca could stop the disease progressing is among the suspended trials.Dr Dickie said: \u0027These iniduals are rapidly running out of time, so suspending projects like these is utterly heartbreaking.\u0027    The British Lung Foundation said in May it had had to pause a phase two clinical trial for new drugs to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma.The condition has no cure and just five per cent of men and 10 per cent of women survive for more than five years.Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, told The Telegraph: \u0027This is not good news for a cancer where survival rates are dismal and there is no cure.\u0027We completely understand the need to focus on Covid-19 right now, but the impact will be colossal, with huge repercussions on the research community and patients who, heartbreakingly, don\u0027t have time to spare. This will mean delays in the trial going ahead and any potential new treatments reaching those who need them.\u0027Michael Lauer, deputy director for extramural research at the US National Institutes of Health, said the effect of Covid-19 on medical research goes beyond just trials.In a article for The Lancet last week, he said: \u0027There have also been tremendous disruptive effects on all biomedical research that is not directly related to Covid.\u0027Laboratories are closed. Communications have been shut down, conferences have been cancelled, supply chains for equipment have been lost, resources have been lost. There have been widespread financial losses within academic medical centres that have had spillover effects on their research operations.\u0027        Thousands of clinical trials halted amid focus on finding coronavirus treatments"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f29d61c10cc02ba03dfab64d8783edcc6a9971/0_393_5930_3560/master/5930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7efad45dc4cb5fa856f2a4424be1a30","title":"loved and lost simon bray photo essay","story":"Photographer Simon Bray’s project Loved and Lost deals with the loss of loved ones. He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8829c9aaceee8d7d6c89ad59f8993f368775fa8f/0_198_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=99ac5384475dcb2f195311321c89aebe","title":"wish it was a coming out older gay people in italy in pictures","story":"Photographer Melissa Ianniello’s long-term project investigates the double taboos of homosexuality and old age in Italy.

Initially just two trains a day will operate, with services likely to be increased next year.Tickets will go on sale from 1 September, priced at £40 each way. They can be booked up to February 2021, allowing passengers to plan a Christmas or new year break in the Dutch capital.The introduction of the service comes amid uncertainty because of ongoing travel restrictions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The UK government has removed the Netherlands from its list of countries people can travel to without having to quarantine on their return.Travellers who arrive back in the UK from the Netherlands after 15 August have to self-isolate for 14 days under coronavirus safety measures. Eurostar says it will offer more flexible booking options, including accepting changes to any booking at no cost up to 14 days before departure.The operator has also suspended its popular seasonal south France route – to Avignon and Marseille – until 2022, in order to focus on routes between London, Paris and Brussels which have the highest demand and shorter journey times.

The cause is uncertain but may be linked to lower stress levels, more play and social contact or a quieter environment.The increase in IQ points was particularly significant for those children at the lower end of the spectrum, where small increases could make a big difference, the researchers said.“There is more and more evidence that green surroundings are associated with our cognitive function, such as memory skills and attention,” said Tim Nawrot, a professor of environmental epidemiology at Hasselt University in Belgium, where the study was conducted.“What this study adds with IQ is a harder, well-established clinical measure. I think city builders or urban planners should prioritise investment in green spaces because it is really of value to create an optimal environment for children to develop their full potential.”The study, published in the journal Plos Medicine, used satellite images to measure the level of greenness in neighbourhoods, including parks, gardens, street trees and all other vegetation.The benefits of more greenery that were recorded in urban areas were not replicated in suburban or rural areas. Nawrot suggested this may be because those places had enough greenness for all children living there to benefit.The researchers took into account the wealth and education levels of the children’s parents, largely ruling out the idea that families who are better placed to support children simply have more access to green space.Higher levels of air pollution are known to impair intelligence and childhood development but this factor was also ruled out as an explanation.Instead, the scientists suggested lower noise levels, lower stress – as found in other research on green space benefits – and greater opportunities for physical and social activities may explain the higher IQ scores.Dr Mathew White, an environmental psychologist at Exeter University in the UK, who was not part of the study team, praised the quality of the research.“I’m always wary of the term intelligence as it has a problematic history and unfortunate associations,” he said. “But, if anything, this study might help us move away from seeing intelligence as innate – it could be influenced by environment, and I think that is much more healthy.”White said it was reasonable to suggest more exercise and less stress as reasons for the higher IQ scores. “But I’m not sure why general intelligence should be improved by these things,” he said. “My guess is the intelligence measures are really picking up a child’s ability to concentrate and stick at a task, which has been shown in green space studies before.”A study of children living in Barcelona, published in 2015, showed more green space was associated with better working memory and attention.The researchers in the new study were able to account for many of the factors likely to affect IQ but data on the type of green space was not available. Previous work has shown this can be important, with trees giving more benefit to child development than farmland or scrubland, for example.The team also did not have information on where the pupils attended school but most Belgian children go to nearby schools.The link between physical activity, endorphins, and improved mental health has been well documented. But now, exercise has been proven to increase brainpower, with researchers at the University of Texas earlier this year finding that aerobic exercise improves blood flow to regions in the brain associated with memory.Certain foods, especially oily fish, nuts and even chocolate, have been linked to improved brain performance. Oily fish is packed with omega-3 fatty acids, while nuts are a great source of vitamin E, and dark chocolate is rich with antioxidants.A good excuse for a midday nap can be that it is justified as an effective method of transforming brainpower for the better. Researchers at the University of Bristol found that in a study of 16 participants, those who had taken a 90-minute nap before performing a set of tasks had improved responses and improvement in processing information.Yoga, meditation and other types of mindful activity have become increasingly popular over recent years. Regardless of the trend, meditation in particular has been found to have a variety of neurological benefits. For instance, researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles found that long-term meditation can help the brain combat the effects of ageing.Positive thoughts, affirmations, and even “manifesting” have been hailed as a way to change life for the better, with the latter even gaining the endorsement of both Gwyneth Paltrow and Oprah Winfrey. But such activities also have a positive effect on the brain, with research suggesting that positive and happy thoughts can stimulate the growth of nerve connections and even increase attentiveness.

Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are readily available alternatives,” he said.“The Exxons and Chevrons of the world are holding us back,” he added. “This initial move does not mean that BP, Shell, Equinor and other oil and gas majors can rest easy and continue with business as usual, even though they are performing relatively better than US oil majors.”ExxonMobil lobbyists met key European commission officials in an attempt to water down the European Green Deal in the weeks before it was agreed, according to climate lobbying watchdog InfluenceMap.Saugestad said he expects Storebrand’s investor peers will follow its lead in esting from companies that support anti-climate lobbying “as part of a logical progression in global fossil fuel estment”.InfluenceMap has previously found that five of the largest listed oil companies – including Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total – spend about $200m a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change.The analysis found that BP spent the most on lobbying activities. The company successfully lobbied US policymakers to weaken a landmark environmental law, clearing the way for new projects, such as oil pipelines and power plants, to move forward with far less federal review of their environmental impact.Under BP’s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, the company has undertaken a major review of its lobby group memberships and severed ties with three associations because of disagreements over their climate-related policies and activities. It has also set ambitious climate targets for the next 10 years, and to 2050."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d291a14eb4cb04550b8355337b0d86ed3a84723d/100_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31eef4c6a50e4e54bc4d2a4f0603abc1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos including rescued pangolins and hyacinth macaws"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af98fc35a78d551584188fccdab450d695b0ff0/0_3371_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7988ff60b15a987f73c36a1b838017f6","title":"uk wine boxes bagnums bottle lockdown","story":"So called ‘bagnums’ and wine boxes prove popular as Britons minimise trips to the supermarket From so-called “bagnums” to “cardbordeaux”, bag-in-box wines have enjoyed a sales surge in the UK during lockdown as Britons opted for better value for money and fewer trips to the supermarket.Amid the easing of lockdown the boom in UK camping and picnicking is now helping to drive sales, as consumers have recognised the portability, convenience and eco-credentials of the new-style products. The packaging means little oxygen enters even once it has been opened, so wine stays fresher for longer – up to six weeks – than in a bottle.The Co-op has bolstered its 12 bag-in-box range (which includes Fairtrade red and white) by an additional six wines in order to meet demand, and is currently trialling a premium dry rosé. Sarah Benson, wine buyer at Co-op, said people were buying into boxed wine because they could get more in a single purchase and it allowed customers to share the wine among a wider group than a smaller bottle. M\u0026ampS winemaker Belinda Kleinig said: “Pouches have definitely gone upmarket: as packaging technology has improved, so too has wine quality, and customers are now happy to bring out their pouches at picnics and parties.”“Lockdown gave bag-in-box wine a real opportunity to shine,” said Sainsbury’s wine buyer Hugh Browne. “Shoppers could get the same great taste in a larger container that kept their wine fresh for six weeks from opening, with fewer trips to the shops.”The tipple is attracting a more erse customer base as more brands enter the market and quality has increased, said Tesco.

The only goal of the Champions League final was scored by Kingsley Coman, a player convicted in 2017 of twice assaulting the mother of his child.The game was won by Bayern Munich, the swaggering superclub whose eight straight league titles means they have won more Bundesligas than the rest of Germany put together. Since 2011, they have regularly trained in Qatar, an emirate with a highly questionable human rights record, and in 2018 they signed a sponsorship deal with its state‑owned airline. And somehow, their win represented a victory for the good guys.At least, though, it wasn’t a victory for Paris Saint-Germain, a club owned by Qatar. It wasn’t, yet, an all-out victory for sportswashing. As states use football as an arm of foreign policy, the reality of what the sport is being used to occlude should never be forgotten.Although there have been much-trumpeted reforms of labour laws, how much practical change there has been is debatable. The kafala system of visa sponsorship, which effectively gives employers the power to prevent their workers changing jobs or leaving the country, remains in place for those in the military, public and domestic sectors. Qatar has persistently refused to reveal how many migrant workers have died during the construction of World Cup stadiums.Qatar may be more liberal than many other Gulf states, but women’s rights remain severely restricted. Women can marry only with the express consent of a male , only men have unilateral right of orce, female siblings get half the inheritance their brothers get and domestic violence and marital rape are not criminalised. Homosexuality remains a crime. In 2018, the Doha edition of the New York Times featured nine blank pages where reports on gay and transgender rights had been excised.In terms of the success of the sportswashing project, it may not matter that PSG lost. While the Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, would no doubt like to pose with the cup, it’s probably not necessary. The club president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, said after the semi-final victory that since the takeover in 2011 “the Champions League has been our dream”, but when Qatari Sports Investments bought the club its stated goal was more modest: to have “a great team and a strong brand on the international scene”.It certainly has that and if it was going to lose to anybody in the final, it may as well be another club with Qatari links – so much that Qatar Airlines could promote the final as the “Qlassico”. Sunday was a great day for club-branded retail outlets at Doha’s Hamad International Airport.PSG are not going away. They remain one of European football’s mega-brands. They will be there if the expanded Club World Cup manages to find itself a slot in the increasingly crowded calendar (and Fifa will have been heartened as it looks to establish that tournament by the success of the World Cup-style format over the past fortnight). If a super league is ever established, they will be a part of it.For those superclubs, the nature of the modern Champions League is a little like pass-the-parcel. Sooner or later there will be a season when there is no side obviously better than the others, or when that side suffer ill-fortune at a key moment, and when that happens being there is enough: sooner or later the music will stop with the prize in their hands. PSG aren’t going to stop being invited to the party any time soon.But this is about more than wealth. In two years under Thomas Tuchel, there has been a clear evolution. It’s not wrong to look at the £1bn expenditure on transfer fees alone and wonder whether the heap of devalued domestic silverware was worth it, but the side that lost to Bayern on Sunday were a world away from the rabble that lost 3-2 at Anfield last season.Neymar remains the centrepiece of the project. He has seemed notably more mature this season and had a decisive influence in both quarter- and semi-finals. He has become one of those issue players about whom debate is soon lost in the froth of the backlash against the backlash against the backlash so the discussion becomes about the discussion rather than about his performances. He is a superstar footballer yet a pawn of Qatari foreign policy and an icon of patriotic Brazilian expectation – that must bring intolerable pressure.

It’s perhaps not an entirely fair comparison given Bayern are probably the best pressing side in the world, but Thomas Müller regained possession more than the PSG front three put together.And again, perhaps, it’s reasonable to wonder whether, given PSG’s enormous advantages over the rest of Ligue 1, and their consequent lack of practice against teams with any hope of challenging them, that pressing from the front can ever be improved. The result was to increase the pressure on the midfield and it’s no coincidence that Leandro Paredes and Ander Herrera, exhausted as Bayern began to exert control in the second half, were the first to be withdrawn.What really cost PSG, though, was the departure of Thomas Meunier for Borussia Dortmund at the end of the domestic season, which exposed the relatively inexperienced Thilo Kehrer to the runs of Coman. When Tuchel spoke of further investment, full-back surely is an area that will be prioritised.For PSG, of course, even amid a pandemic there is plenty of money for further signings. The wealth of Qatar is not quite infinite, but it is more than enough for funds to remain available as more traditional revenue streams dry up. The superclubs will continue to dominate, and those with the might of states behind them are less susceptible to the changing winds of the sport’s finances than the rest. For PSG, Sunday’s defeat was a dream not ended but deferred."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8be1f036e9325f8b4352741fbe2e56e106f1f8c0/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4944e100ed61d35e2d9481df23663831","title":"how the pandemic gave me my time back laura lippmann","story":"From dressing up to writing a novel to starting a family film festival, author Laura Lippmann says the pandemic gave her the gift of timeI was on deadline – technically, past deadline – when my state imposed a stay-at-home order in March.

I treated my time as people are advised to handle their paychecks if they wish to save money: I paid myself first. When I arrived at my day job at 9.30am, my work on my novel had been banked, so I could throw myself whole-heartedly into whatever life at the newspaper brought me. I liked both my jobs, but when I was finally lucky enough to risk life as a full-time novelist, I realized how exhausting it had been to juggle the two. In fact, I often wondered if all that work had cost me my first marriage.Yet there I was at my dining room table in the spring of 2020, having traveled full circle, only my day job now involved supervising my daughter’s virtual classroom, thanks to Covid. I got up at 5am and worked until my daughter rose at 8. In this way, I not only finished my novel by 1 June, I found myself awash in time. The 24 hours that had never seemed enough a few months earlier was now an interest-bearing account that kept producing unexpected idends.In part, I was rich with time because the pandemic forced efficiency on areas of my life where I had been wildly profligate. Take grocery shopping and meal planning. Because I live in a walkable urban neighborhood, in the before time I often went to grocery stores three, four times a week. Now I sat down on Sunday mornings, made a plan for the week, then went to a small store I chose for its superior butcher counter and cozy size. I was in and out in 30 minutes and that task, which had eaten up hours a week in my previous life, was done. Bonus: My family, which had been used to going to restaurants two or three times weekly, was eating healthier, homecooked meals and I became a better cook.Thrown together every night – no tennis lessons for me, no art class for my daughter, no work gigs for my spouse or me – we started a family film festival. The rules were simple: we took turns picking movies and no one could veto another’s choice or even complain about it. In that way, we watched older classics, such as My Darling Clementine, and modern ones like Paddington 2. How my heart swelled when my daughter selected Some Like it Hot on her night, how joyful I was when she said at the end of the original The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3, “That is a perfect movie.”And still there was time. Tantalized by a Twitter challenge thrown out by New Yorker writer Rachel Syme, I began dressing up every day, styling my hair, putting on make-up, taking selfies and posting them to my feed, often with the stories behind the outfits. In my pre-pandemic life, I often wore workout clothes from morning to night, going from sweats to pajamas. Now I plumbed the riches of my closet and, in the most counter-intuitive move possible, reactivated my suspended Rent the Runway subscription so I could experiment with new looks. Superficial as it may sound, this attention to what I wore gave the days a much-needed variety and lifted my spirits. I loved the hour or so I spent fussing with my outfits.And still there was time. My trainer, whom I had seen twice a week, was now doing sessions via Zoom at a lower price. So I opted for three sessions, then worked out on One of Those Bikes two days a week. (I had gone into 2020 with “purchase Peloton” on my resolution list, so please no pandemic Peloton shaming.) Once my book was done, I began using my mornings for long walks, logging at least 7,000 steps by 7 am, listening to podcasts. Already pretty fit, I found myself in the best shape of my life and bursting with endorphins.And still there was time. I began compulsively zhuzhing and decluttering my house. “Isn’t everyone doing this?” I asked my therapist, to whom I now spoke by phone, saving me an hour because I no longer had to drive to and from her office. “No, Laura,” she said, “I think everyone’s talking about doing that.” I made small repairs, I organized closets and cupboards.I realize all of this reeks of privilege, that this is the life of a woman who is not worrying about money or her job. Does it make it better if I admit that despite my attempts to fill my days with positive activities, I wasn’t always happy? In fact, I was often depressed, especially on my daughter’s behalf. I would give anything if I could give her the old world back. I can’t, so instead I choose Hope and Glory for family movie night, hoping she sees the parallels between the pandemic and the blitz.Over the past six months, I have returned to a beloved book by Ruth McKenney, best known for the My Sister Eileen stories. In Love Story, she wrote about her marriage to Richard Brantsen. They were committed Communists and anti-fascists in the 1930s, appalled by world events. But they were not without joy, although the tragic end of their marriage – he committed suicide on her birthday in 1955 – suggests that McKenney left some things out of her love story.I write, I shop, I cook, I work out, I walk, I watch movies, and still there is time. I find myself feeling happy, feel guilty about the happiness and scold myself, but the happiness creeps back. No delphiniums for me to separate, so I take a copy of my just published book of essays, cut up the pages, and decoupage a lampshade for the gussied-up guest room where, I promise my daughter, one day we will have guests again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19ed0583483c6c03a5939f88a6d2ad4d622ec0fc/0_81_847_508/master/847.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0475d23242a28a212f3f9afcb594fda7","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

The payments are not declared in the documents.Councils, which normally fund SPDs, and developers have denied allegations of conflicts of interest, but critics fear the arrangements mean “poachers become gamekeepers”.The practice has emerged less than two weeks after ministers announced a wholesale reform of the planning system which campaigners and voters fear will hand greater powers to developers in order to speed up building.According to responses the  obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Conservative-run Barnet council in north London received £223,000 from the housing association Notting Hill Genesis to cover the costs of a planning brief for Grahame Park, a 3,000-home estate regeneration. The borough accepted the money via its joint venture company with Capita.The SPD for Grahame Park specified additional social housing only “where viable” and the housing association later proposed cutting the number of affordable homes by 257. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, described it as “a classic example of how not to do estate regeneration”.In Hounslow, west London, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) paid the Labour-run council £20,000 to fund supplementary planning guidance for a barracks site it is planning to sell for the development of 1,000 homes, which critics have attacked as over-development.In response to a freedom of information request to all English councils, none outside the capital said they engaged in the practice.The London councils insist the arrangements afford developers no unfair influence over what is permitted on the sites, but some cited budget shortfalls as the reason for needing to take the money. Critics, however, attacked the practice.“It is blatant collusion between planning authorities and developers,” said Bob Colenutt, the head of research the Northampton Institute for Urban Affairs and author of The Property Lobby. “Is this what the government means by cutting planning red tape? ... Poachers have become gamekeepers with local councils ceding yet more influence over planning to vested interests in speculative development.”Steve Reed, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said: “Government cuts to council funding have left town halls without the resources to develop full planning guidelines so developers have been allowed to write their own. This appears to be part of a strategy to diminish the voice of local communities and let wealthy developers bulldoze and concrete over local neighbourhoods and green spaces increasingly at will.”Reed said it was a harbinger of the “anti-democratic planning reforms” the government proposed earlier this month, which could fast-track development without a requirement for detailed planning consent.Councils usually pay for and draw up SPDs to provide guidance for what developers will be allowed to do. Councils said that plans drawn up using developer cash must still be meet wider planning rules. They are a material consideration in planning decisions.“It is often said that ‘he who pays the piper calls the tune,’” said Steve Goodrich, a senior research manager at Transparency International UK. “Any planning guidance developed which then contributes to council policy should be drafted in the public interest, not that of landowners and developers. Accepting payments for this work from those with a clear financial interest in the outcome risks exposing the authors to heavy and undue influence.”Barnet council also received £140,000 from the development company Joseph \u0026amp Partners to draft a strategy for the renewal of North Finchley town centre. It then entered into a partnership agreement with the firm. The planning document included a proposal to demolish an art deco shopping arcade and replace it with an 12-storey apartment building. Campaigners including Dave Davies, the Kinks guitarist who used to buy guitar strings at the arcade in the 1960s, are opposing the scheme.Jonathan Joseph, the head of Joseph \u0026amp Partners, denied there was any conflict of interest. “If and when any proposals do come forward for North Finchley, a full consultation and engagement process will be undertaken,” he said.Barnet denied the arrangements gave developers the role of poacher and gamekeeper. An SPD cannot be in conflict with wider planning policies in the borough, it said.Notting Hill Genesis stressed that Barnet “retained responsibility for final decision-making both on the SPD and subsequent planning decisions” for Grahame Park.The council cited “a decade of government cuts” as a reason for needing to accept the funds, but said the landowner had no unfair influence over the planning brief.Dan Brown, a spokesman for SGN, said: “We had no role in producing the planning brief and the brief does not necessarily reflect the most favourable possible outcome for us.”“The draft planning brief underwent full public consultation,” said Lily Bath, the deputy leader of Hounslow council. “The brief is in no way a guarantee for planning permission, but provides a framework for consideration of future planning applications.”An MoD spokesperson said it works “collaboratively with councils to draft guidance that ensure a quicker, and more cost efficient process for planning, design and development.”• This article was amended on 24 August 2020 because an earlier version misspelled Grahame Park estate as “Graeme Park”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54ed49586c103ecf9aea6f466d56453059b6b914/0_175_5421_3255/master/5421.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d1ed5d2d06a2edfacbee13fb868e5dfa","title":"can you solve it win the car dodge the goat","story":"A new take on a famous problem If you are a reader of this column, you have probably heard of the Monty Hall problem. It’s a famous probability puzzle that involves a game show host, Monty Hall, who asks a contestant to open one of three doors. Behind one of the doors is a car, and behind the other two are goats.(If you haven’t heard of this puzzle, or want to read the problem in full, there’s lots about it on the web. It also features in the novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.)Today’s puzzle is a new adaptation of the Monty Hall problem. You will be set what seems to be an impossible challenge. Yet the solution is simple and ingenious.Here we go. Again, the set-up involves a game show and three doors. Behind one door is a car. Behind a second door are the car keys. Behind the third door is a goat. The car, the keys and the goat were placed there randomly, meaning that each item has a 13 chance of being behind any particular door.Twins Timmy and Tammy, the contestants, are backstage on the game show. They are told the rules:1) Timmy will be taken on stage first. He will be asked to open two of the doors, and then shut them. Timmy will then be led off stage to a holding room on his own.2) Tammy will then be taken on stage. She will be asked to open two of the doors.If Timmy opens the door with the car, and Tammy opens the door with the keys, then they both get to keep the car. In all other outcomes, they leave with nothing.The twins are given 10 minutes to think up a door-opening strategy before Timmy goes on stage. What strategy gives them the best chance of winning the car?Just to be clear: The twins do not know what is behind any of the doors before they ask for a door to be opened. When one door is opened, all they can see is what is behind that door. The car, car keys and goat stay behind the same door for the duration of the programme. When Timmy is on stage opening his two doors, Tammy cannot see or hear what is going on. Thus when Tammy is choosing her two doors, she has no idea what was behind the two doors that Timmy opened.If the twins had no strategy, that is, if both of them choose two doors at random, the probability Timmy gets the car is 23, and the probability Tammy gets the keys is also 23. The probability they get to keep the car is thus 23 x 23  49  44 per cent.Yet, rather incredibly, there is a strategy that gives them well over 50 per cent chance of keeping the car. What is it?I’ll be back at 5pm UK time with the solutions.Today’s puzzle is taken from Surprises in Probability- Seventeen Short Stories, by Dutch mathematician Henk TijmsI set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday.

Victory in the Women’s Open – ultimately so comfortable the scale of her underdog status was easily forgotten – means the 27-year-old becomes the first German to claim a major title on British soil.In the first staging of this championship on the famed Ayrshire links, Popov joins a stellar list – Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson et al – of iconic Troon major winners. Popov was in floods of tears even before tapping in for victory on the 72nd green.That scene only emphasised earlier battles and a life-changing performance. Moments later she walked towards the clubhouse with champagne bottle in hand even golf’s blazer brigade had to nod in approval.This seemed the most unlikely of outcomes. Popov was chasing success in 54-hole competitions on the Cactus Tour in the middle of this year. The very name seems to perfectly articulate that level. She began this week as the world No 304 and without any apparent major credentials whatsoever. She did not even have status on the LPGA Tour. Now, Popov can pick and choose where to play.She started day four holding a three-stroke lead, a supposedly dicey situation for a player unaccustomed to challenging for titles. Popov’s position never looked under serious threat. Her closing 68 meant a two-stroke success, at seven under par overall. Jasmine Suwannapura, the Thai player who like Tiger Woods has rebounded from career-saving back surgery, finished second.“This feels amazing,” said Popov. “There has been a lot of work, there have been a lot of struggles. I knew I was capable, I just had a lot of obstacles in my way. The Women’s Open to me was a bonus. I got here on Tuesday, I knew my game was in good shape and anything was possible. I just took that belief into every round but I never expected this.”If Popov was, quite understandably, never counting on victory, one hole emphasised what was meant to be. Her drive at the 15th appeared destined for one of the treacherous fairway bunkers, with the ball instead scuttling into adjacent rough. Her subsequent iron shot, from an uphill lie, finished 20ft from the hole. With the birdie putt duly converted, she led by four.Only Suwannapura belatedly threatened to spoil the party, thanks to a superb birdie from 40ft on the 16th. Popov responded with another one of her own at the same hole. Suwannapura swung again, collecting another shot at the par-three 17th. Yet the leader knew only a disastrous finish would cost her the first women’s major of 2020. There was no such implosion, nor any suggestion of one. Minjee Lee finished third, at three under.The Sunday scene was perfect. Gone were the gusts that affected the first two rounds, with the coast as close as seemed possible to flat calm.Popov is due immense credit for this nerveless win but one wonders how the elements may have disrupted the mindset of one so unaccustomed to jousting for the top titles. She made bogey from sand at the first but bounced back with three birdies in her next five holes.“I used to be a player who didn’t like to lead so this was a new position,” she said. “I just had belief going into this round. I told myself I was capable of birdies on every hole.”Lydia Ko stood with arms aloft on the 18th green after converting a lengthy putt for par. The celebrations embodied her final day. At three over, the re-emerging New Zealander finished with a share of 14th. Better – much better – is surely to come from the two-times major winner. It would be wise to keep an eye on her during the remainder of this year.So too Inbee Park, whose 66 meant fourth place. “It’s my husband’s first week at a major championship,” she said. “Posting a top-10 finish for him is a really nice thing to do.” Park, Lee, Suwannapura and Popov were the only players to break par.This was a highly successful event and justified the persistence of the R\u0026ampA in staging it. Pace of play, the scourge of golf in recent times, was not an issue at all.Troon responded magnificently at a juncture where a major for the female game had never carried such value. The highest prize of all belongs to Popov. Cactus Tour no more. Eat your heart out, Bernhard Langer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38390f43a6c4f1afbf625d85c626bbef006467a2/0_249_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=386d3b1be85caeb0abe7b1e07d2de151","title":"tour de france 2020 cycling stage guide","story":"The 107th edition of the classic features a Grand Départ on the Riviera and eight mountain days on the 21-stage routeTwo loops north of Nice over a serious-looking climb, the Côte de Rimiez, with a finish on the Promenade des Anglais with 38km between the last bit of uphill and the finish, there is time for the peloton to regroup if it splits on the climb. Will favour sprinters who can climb a bit such as the Italian Elia Viviani.The toughest opening weekend stage in 40 years. First category Cols de la Colmiane and Turini will show immediately if any favourites are off form, and should cause a selection of maybe 50 riders a final little climb 9km from the end is tailor-made for home hopefuls Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot.Immensely scenic run north partly using the Route Napoléon through towns like Grasse and Digne les Bains. Peppered with small climbs early on, but a mainly downhill final 80km means unless it’s full-on all the way this should be one for the pure sprinters such as the Aussie Caleb Ewan or Ireland’s Sam Bennett.An unusually tough summit finish for this early in the Tour at a ski resort famed for a 1971 duel between Eddy Merckx and Luis Ocaña, at the end of a long drag to 1,825m above sea level. There will be a sort-out among the favourites, but nothing conclusive. Another good finish for Alaphilippe, or a strong finisher such as Rigoberto Urán.Largely downhill, this is another one earmarked for the sprinters, but the finish merits a closer look, climbing gradually in the final eight kilometres. Might favour a “punchy” finisher such as the Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet or Milan-San Remo winner Wout van Aert.The second tough summit finish in three days: a 12km ascent to the Col de la Lusette, a brief downhill and an 8km drag to the finish. With 150km before the climbs, a break will get here well before the main men sort each other out. One for climbers with no aspirations overall, such as the Frenchmen Pierre Rolland or Kenny Elissonde.Brutally lumpy and baking-hot roads in the Massif Central and a meaty 14.5km climb in the middle. The finale will see a classic battle between a break and the sprinters’ teams, with odds on the break. A day for a strong all-terrain rider such as the Belgian Tiesj Benoot or France’s Lilian Calmejane.A classic Pyrenean stage: two first-category mountains and the super-category Port de Balès. There should be a pattern to the racing now and a strong team such as Jumbo or Ineos should control the pace. It’s a tricky downhill to the finish so while the overall contenders test each other, the stage will suit a climber with descending skills such as the Slovenian Matej Mohoric.A break should succeed today: there will be an intense battle until it forms and it will get whittled down on the Col de Marie-Blanque 19 km from the finish. One for a climber who can finish well, and isn’t high up overall: if Ireland’s Daniel Martin or Uran are not in the top 20 they will target this one.A transfer up the Atlantic coast for the flattest stage of the race. Bound to be a sprint finish so one for the likes of Bennett or Ewan or Viviani, but the question is whether the wind blows strongly off the sea in which case the race is likely to split and the outcome is anyone’s guess.The only truly innocuous stage in the first 10 days, and there should be a westerly so this will be rapid. By now it will be obvious which sprinters are in the mix so there will be pressure on the second-stringers such as Nacer Bouhanni of France and Giacomo Nizzolo of Italy if they haven’t landed one yet.A rare stage longer than 200km. Lumpy roads into the fiefdom of ex-president Chirac and tired legs will make this another day for a break while the select group of favourites wait for the Alps. Wise money will go on a clever one-day specialist such as the young world champion Mads Pedersen or a strongman like Thomas De Gendt.Arguably the hardest stage, with seven climbs ending with the highest pass of the Massif Central. It’s a day that should decide the polka-dot best-climber’s jersey, while the finish will show who is looking good for the Alps. Will favour a pure climber such as Mikel Landa or Nairo Quintana, but anyone wanting to win has to show well here.A second category climb after 68.5km will see off many of the sprinters, while a couple of short late hills will favour an attack from the likes of France’s Benoît Cosnefroy, or De Gendt. The overall contenders will want to stay out of trouble as the Alps loom.A super-category uphill finish on a super-steep climb in the southern Jura this is where GC riders such as Egan Bernal or Primoz Roglic will have to show what they have left. The concentrated climbing in the final 80km will make it difficult for a break to succeed so an overall contender such as Bernal might win here.Never flat, and with an 11km climb into the Vercors Massif, this stage favours an early break, and the winner will probably escape on the ascent 20km from the finish. It’s the sort of stage that suits a climber who isn’t afraid to go solo, such as the Dutchman Bauke Mollema if he isn’t in the overall mix.The last of eight Alpine stages: a saw-tooth profile, with the partly gravel Plateau de Glières 32km from the finish. None of the favourites can afford a bad day here, but it doesn’t have the scary look of the day before. A stage for a break, a last chance for a rider like Romain Bardet or Warren Barguil to shine if he has had a poor three weeks.The last day when a team that haven’t won a stage can break their duck in recent years a handful of teams have dominated in the Tour, so the pressure could be on half the field. Even so, it’s likely to be a bunch sprint for whoever has survived the Alps.Stage 20, 19 September, Lure – La Planche des Belles Filles, 36km time trialTime was the Tour had up to 120km of time trials but that has been whittled down to create more exciting racing for television. A steep uphill finish like this one should confirm what we’ve seen on the climbs in the past few days France will be praying for a good Tour from Pinot, whose home village of Melisey features early on today.The final stage of the Tour, so expect the usual bunch sprint – last year won by Ewen – but with two provisos. The first is how the race has weathered the Covid-19 storm – will riders and teams have dropped out along the way? – and the second, how the riders have coped with relatively little competition time in this condensed, rejigged season of racing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d038e4997430071cd2949d1234e0372f0e314e/0_0_4107_2465/master/4107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86b8465efdb1d0a7312c49cb7ffd213b","title":"england v pakistan third test day four live","story":"30th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Abid Ali 28, Azhar Ali 2) Jofra is mostly into his steady mode, bowling 88mph in the channel.

And Chris Woakes mildly displeased. 26th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Abid Ali 26, Azhar Ali 0) Broad goes off the field, presumably to check his bowling average for the summer (13.13). On comes Jofra Archer, whose average is rather different – 43.75. He deserves better, and begins with a maiden to Azhar, moving through the gears from 84mph to 88.25th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Abid Ali 26, Azhar Ali 0) With one opener gone and the other one bruised, Anderson tries to turn the screw by bringing in a leg slip for Abid Ali, but he stands firm and pushes into the covers for two. 24th over: Pakistan 49-1 (Abid Ali 24, Azhar Ali 0) So Azhar Ali comes out to bat for the third time in this match – he sent himself out to open last night, but wasn’t required and was able to change his tune this morning. Also, Pakistan maintain their long-standing policy of not having an opening partnership of 50 in England. The last was in 1996, apparently.It was umpire’s call, so Shan Masood was a little unlucky – but he did play no stroke to a ball that was either brushing off stump or missing it by a millimetre. That’s yet another wicket for Broad, his 29th in five Tests since being left out.He’s reviewing, but he played no stroke and it just brushed his pad, slap in front of off...23rd over: Pakistan 49-0 (Shan Masood 18, Abid Ali 24) Abid picks up a couple with a thick inside edge off Anderson. “He’s definitely looking more confident as an opener now,” says Wasim Akram, not totally convincingly. The curse of the commentator strikes instantly as Abid is rapped on the glove, fending a lifter off his ribs. He is holding his finger as if it’s broken. The physio trots out to administer a cloud of spray, and Abid resumes with a play-and-miss.22nd over: Pakistan 47-0 (Shan Masood 18, Abid Ali 22) Broad cranks up the accelerator to 84 now, and he beats Masood with a David Warner special – angled in, swinging away. Masood fights back with a straight drive, the first four of this monster session. 21st over: Pakistan 43-0 (Shan Masood 14, Abid Ali 22) Masood takes a single off his pads. When he makes it to 14 against Anderson, he usually gets to 140. There’s another appeal against Abid Ali, for caught behind, but again it’s a bit token and when it’s turned down, England don’t review.Here’s Richard Morris. “While I would normally hesitate to fence with Mr Forth on stats, I think he’s forgotten that three of this England XI’s highest scores were Not Out (Sibley, Pope and Woakes) which I think makes the team average high score actually a shade over 193. Drop Archer for Stokes in the next Test (I know, I know) and the average moves to a world-beating 222.” Ha. I had a thought about Ian Forth’s stat, too: didn’t England have three 250 men at once in the last days of Alastair Cook – him, Root and Stokes? 20th over: Pakistan 42-0 (Shan Masood 13, Abid Ali 22) You’ll never guess who’s bowling at the other end. Yes, it’s Stuart Broad, who, for once, looks like the veteran he is, running in with knees not pumping at all and dishing up military medium, 79-82mph. Abid Ali plays out another maiden. 19th over: Pakistan 42-0 (Shan Masood 13, Abid Ali 22) Anderson has five men saving the single and only three close catchers, which is absurd – although he may have decided that the catchers won’t catch the ball anyway. That’s a maiden to Abid Ali, with nothing happening bar a half-hearted shout for LBW off the last ball.Yes, it’s Jimmy. In case you’re just back from the Antarctic, he needs two more wickets for 600 in Tests.The England players go into their huddle at the start of what could be a 52-over session. This is a ridiculous length, but at least it’s a satisfying number, redolent of weeks in the year or cards in the pack. Also, the number of Tests played by Don Bradman.Something tells me Joe Root is going to ask Jimmy Anderson to bowl. He’s turning his arm over on the outfield.Play will start in just over five minutes, if the weather gods don’t get in the way again. “Ed Bayling,” says Robin Hazlehurst, “needs to try his best Bond-villain accent when saying Kriz, and he will realise it is where the batsmen stands. Ochki are indeed glasses, but are also points in games, so it is used here for runs (also ‘rans’). A six is translated as ‘a six-point shot’. Not sure about the derivation of it, and it does sound beautifully like every batsman getting a pair, but it isn’t actually.” Single quotes, author’s own. Thanks Robin.Afternoon everyone and thanks Daniel. He’s right, you know playing top-level sport is nothing to the pressures of the OBO. It’s been socially distanced for decades. You don’t even set eyes on your partner. And while Jimmy Anderson may sometimes curse his slip fielders, at least he never has to go through a long email replacing double quotes with single ones. “52 over session?!” exclaims an aghast Craig Fawcett. “Isn’t there something in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that prevents a cricketer from fielding for 52 overs (under Test conditions)?”Fielding? Fielding?! Pah! These lads should try OBOing. On which seamless segue, that’s me done for the day – thanks so much for your company and comments, it’s been a belter. Sorry if I’ve not got to you, but please do get in touch with Tim de Lisle, who’ll guide you through the evening sesh. “Apologies if I’m late to the party with this one,” says Paul Lakin, “but, Pete Salmon, I see your Cicero and raise you Peter Cook: ‘I met a man at a party. He said ‘I’m writing a novel.’ I replied ‘Neither am I’.”What does one do when one requires a third style of quotation mark? “If it’s any help,” offers Ed Bayling, “my basic Duolingo Russian leads me to deduce that the footnotes in Christopher Edge’s book are mostly explanations of the basics: ‘Batsman’, ‘Bowler’, ‘Century’, ‘Runs’ (which appears to translate as ‘glasses’), ‘Pitch’ and one that looks like ‘kriz’, which I’m stuck on. Perhaps someone cleverer than me could assist?”“Murder Must Advertise by Dorothy L Sayers sees the story climax at a cricket game where Lord Peter Wimsey’s ability as a batsman moves the plot along nicely,” reckons Richard Jansz-Moore. “Also AA Thomson’s Exquisite Burden has a great chapter on a cricket match. Sadly that one appears to be out of print and I only read it as my grandparents had a copy. Well worth a read though if anyone can find a copy.”I’m trying so hard not to make sport of Ian McEwan’s 613-page squash match, but you all keep baiting me. “Australia’s team for the first Test of the 2005 series had an average highest score of 197,” says the multitalented Steve Hudson. “I can’t imagine that would ever have been bettered.” I wondered about them because Gillespie has a test 200 and Warne and Lee could also bat, but I thought McGrath might’ve hampered them. Might they have had a higher average for Edgbaston? “So, WG Grace had a high-pitched, slightly comical West Country accent?” asks Steve Hudson. “In the biopic, wouldn’t Pam Ayres be perfect?” Tea has already been taken, so we’ll have 52 overs from then, and can go till 7.30 to get them in if weather and light permit. “If there are no spectators hence no ticket sales, and if one day of the Test is rained off, why not just add another day to compensate and avoid draws through bad weather?” asks Hugh Paterson. “TV channels would be happy.”I’m not sure they would, given they’ll have scheduled stuff for Wednesday, but the Test championship mitigates against jiggery-pokery of that sort because all matches need to be played under identical conditions. Also, we’ve accepted that the weather is part of cricket, and couldn’t add time on in the middle of a match because then England would’ve batted longer except they didn’t know to. “A Season In Sinji,’ says Andrew Burton, “written in 1967 by JL Carr, has lashings of cricket plus a Second World War setting, proper characters (a hissable villain who turns out to be just another damaged human being) and a sequence of gradually devastating emotional payoffs. Highly recommended.”Not to be confused with JD Carr, the Fawad Alam of his dad. “Rider Sandman, the hero of Bernard Cornwell’s book ‘Gallows Thief’, is a professional cricketer,” offers Ian Andrew.And if I am my father’s son, I am right in saying that Pelham Grenville Wodehouse was a decent left-arm spinner.“I’ve been engaged in a little stat guru fossicking today,” overshares Ian Forth. “Two points emerged from this rabbit holing: next time England take the field they will likely have Crawley, Root and Stokes in the team, three men who have Test high-scores of 250+. This has only happened twice before: Barrington, Edrich and Graveney in 1965-68 and Hutton, May and Compton in 1954-55. And as if that were not enough of a statsgasm, this Test could have England fielding a side with its members boasting the highest-ever average Test high-score (i.e. add up all their test high scores and ide by 11), that figure being 158.55. I’m happy to be disproved on the second stat, there’s always scope to learn and improve in this life.I fear that final line is contrary to the spirit of the OBO, but otherwise, this is majestic work. On the second point, given Broad and Woakes have Test tons and Bess has a Test 50, you might be right. “Just reading the back and forth about books leads me to a pet subject,” muses Kim Thonger. “Different outcomes to cricket matches in parallel but slightly different universes. Imagine one close by where Jimmy’s four dropped catches in 30-something deliveries had all been snaffled instead and he’s already on 601 and thinking happily about the next 99 to take him to 700. We could make a screenplay to be filmed by Christopher Nolan in his inimitable unfathomable style, with Colin Farrell as Jimmy. To improve box office receipts I suggest we involve Brad Pitt somehow, possibly as a grizzled third umpire with maverick tendencies.”I can only countenance Michael Gough as himself, but would permit Pitt as a bungling but strangely lovable text commentator. “Please tell Max Millings not to lament, as we’ve been living his memoirs via the OBO for fifteen years or more,” says Brad McMillan. “Therefore, even while remaining ‘unpublished’, he’s already reached his audience and, sadly, missed out on the royalties. I’ve enjoyed the the experience though, so please also send him my thanks.”What greater royalties could there be than those? “I don’t think Brian Blessed would do at all,” says Ben Mallalieu. “WG had by all accounts a slightly comical high-pitched voice, a bit like David Beckham. I have often wondered if there is a correlation between high-pitched voices and sporting prowess. Any thoughts?”I’ve always enjoyed how Jos Buttler’s voice is the precise opposite of Jos Buttler’s batting. “Re: C. Aubrey Smith’s Hollywood Cricket Club,” says Richard Farmer. “Did you know that Boris Karloff was the first player to score a century for the HCC.”Of Boris Karloffdrive, as they called him. I did not, but that is incredible, thanks. It’s looking much drier now, so I’d hope for a start not that long after three – assuming it doesn’t rain again, which it doesn’t look like it’s going to. Hopefully we’ll get a start sometime after that. “Since someone mentioned the era,” emails Roger Higgs, “I was reading about Conan Doyle, who was a keen sportsman (in addition to doctor, campaigner for justice, spiritualist etc!) and played some first class cricket. His batting average was not too bad but he only claimed one wicket as a bowler - WG Grace!”Similarly, I’ve only failed to identify one Oscar-winning screenwriter as an OBOer - Simon Beaufoy! “It’s true that the American moneybags, Daddy Warbucks types, rarely fund anything without a Stateside slant,” says James Debens. “My feature-length musical remake of The Odd Couple, with former cricket stars David Boon and Fast Eddie Hemmings in the lead roles, has yet to be picked up by anyone but the Italian broadcasters Raiuno. And even they insist that Monica Bellucci plays the lightly sweating third umpire. It’s not enough that Hamfatter, Scouting For Girls and Deep Blue Something have agreed to pen original cricket-themed songs or that Pete Waterman will pack up his train set and let us turn his back garden into Lord’s. (Rod Stewart backed out when we wouldn’t cast Gavin Hamilton).” Surely Fast Eddie is already playing himself in the Hustler (of not-so-quick singles)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c693ac7f1ad4fa52ab8687220250942f38970ff0/0_16_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=96d278dfe8aa141205ce0d00ca941290","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

If you’re one of the thousands who have saddled up for the first time during or post-lockdown, fear not – this isn’t your average commuting kit.I’m on my way to catch a train to Lyme Regis, the starting point of a coast-to-coast bikepacking trip (basically, cycling and carrying your camping kit) via four of England’s oldest trails. Known collectively as the Greater Ridgeway, the 362-mile mixed-terrain route has neolithic roots and is a favourite with hikers. Departing from Dorset’s dramatic Jurassic Coast, it meanders along the Wessex Ridgeway, the Ridgeway, the Icknield Way and Peddars Way to Holme-next-the-Sea in Norfolk. OS Maps suggest there’s a corresponding cycle route, with bike-friendly ersions along the way, making it a (seemingly) ideal route for a bikepacking expedition.Although not a new phenomenon, bikepacking is a growing trend. Panniers and racks are out the preferred option is now specialist luggage attached to the bike by Velcro and straps in a streamlined set up. “We’ve seen an increase in sales and new customers,” says George Huxford of bag maker Apidura, confirming that, as with the rest of the cycling industry, Covid has had a positive impact on business.While a hedge and a waterproof bivvy bag are the preferred choice of sleeping quarters for hardcore enthusiasts, most bikepackers opt for a bothy or official campsite. This makes bikepacking bang on trend, combining camping with a more enjoyable method of arriving at your pitch than sitting in a car or taking public transport. Cycling UK is a valuable resource, starting with advice on how to plan a simple weekend ride and camp miles from your doorstep.What I’m attempting is certainly on the more extreme side (minus the hedges). An experienced cyclist with a number of 100-mile sportives under my belt, I’m looking to cover the Greater Ridgeway in four days – those looking for a more leisurely ride could choose a shorter section over more time. Four hours in, though, I’m questioning the plans I’d made from the comfort of my front room.Boulder-packed descents, loose gravel climbs and impassable sections of path that look like they haven’t been walked on, let alone ridden, since the stone age mean it’s slow going over Dorset’s undulating countryside. When I find myself 42 miles short of my campsite in Sixpenny Handley with only three hours of daylight left, I need to find a more direct route. Unlike the druids before me, I have the benefit of switching to smooth asphalt roads.I arrive at Church Farm Caravan and Camping Park (pitches from £11.50) as the sun is setting, the tougher travails of the day softened by my catching a glimpse of the Cerne Giant while descending into the village of Cerne Abbas. Hastily assembling my tarp – a sheet that provides the shelter of a tent for a fraction of the weight – in the light of a friendly neighbour’s car headlights, I conclude that I need a plan B. My routes will have to change, allowing me to reach my remaining campsites in daylight, see some more sights and average 90 miles a day. I will cut out some of the winding, time-consuming tracks and trails in favour of the streets of Newbury, Cambridge and Thetford.New routes plotted, I find the riding improves immediately. I have time for a leisurely pit stop at The Bridge Inn, Upper Woodford, north of Salisbury, for coffee and a thick slice of carrot cake, and continue across the Salisbury Plain military training ground (there are various routes, but the clearly marked danger zones should, obviously, be avoided). The views across the hills are breathtaking and I even spy muntjac, hares and pheasants.This was the bikepacking experience I’d hoped for: Wilton Windmill appearing on the hillside from a quiet country lane waving to barges on the canalside paths of the Kennet and tackling the Ridgeway’s woodland trails with hearty helpings of calories every few hours. Reaching White Mark Farm campsite in Watlington (pitches from £8) ahead of schedule, I down a well-earned pint and devour a pizza in the Spire \u0026amp Spoke’s sunny beer garden before I tend to my tarp, queue for my socially distanced shower and bed down for the night as red kites circle above.A 5.30am wakeup call courtesy of that distinctive screech doesn’t dampen my spirits, and I’m soon back in the saddle – a 110-mile epic standing between me and the Kings Forest Caravan Park (adults only, pitches from £15) on the NorfolkSuffolk border. It starts with a rollercoaster ride past Chequers, and by lunchtime I’m grateful to have swapped the punchy peaks of the Chilterns for the pan-flat Fens. The addition of luggage makes the climbs rather harder (an off-piste ascent on Aldbury Common sticks in the mind), but the trick is to embrace bikepacking’s slower nature. The environment then takes on a new vividness, making for a much more rewarding experience.I rise with the sun, the scent of the pine forests lingering while I pack up for the last time. There’s just 50 miles to go and the waves of Norfolk’s coast are pulling me towards the end – even a ford, ripe for a spot of wild swimming in Castle Acre, can’t break their magnetic spell. I grin when I spy the Wash and don’t stop smiling until I reach the sandy beach of Holme-next-the-Sea.After a train ride from King’s Lynn, I’m back grinding through traffic on London’s streets. While my expedition may have got off to a choppy start, I’ve been bitten by the bikepacking bug. I’m plotting my next escape from the city before I even reach my front door.• Charlie Allenby is the author of Bike London (Spring 2021, ACC Art Books).

Bespectacled, gawky, socially awkward and only 23 years old, I had been a surprising choice as a correspondent on Michael Moore’s TV Nation, a US network show where I stumbled around the wilds of America meeting extremists of various stripes: klansmen, cult members, sexual adventurers.Later, based on these segments, I landed my own TV series, Louis Theroux’s Weird Weekends. For some reason the BBC had insisted on putting my name in the title. Watching some of my early efforts again recently, with the distance of two decades, I couldn’t help passing judgment on the journalistic competence on display – whether I was asking the right questions of the porn performers and the apocalypse preppers. Sometimes I caught myself enjoying the raw, unvarnished reality and marvelling at how much we had managed to capture on tape. From time to time I saw the younger me as overly pushy and badgering, or in danger of being borderline rude. But I could see that was mostly from my awkwardness at being hired for a job I didn’t fully understand, and my worries about letting people down. Mainly I was distracted by my appearance, voice and how I came across. The way my hair is piled on top of my head. The faint mid-Atlantic twang in my accent.I was definitely a little bit of a tool, but what was harder to know was whether that was an obstacle or part of my gift.I was watching my old shows back recently not for simple nostalgia – though that would have been a good enough reason given how much has changed – but because I was faced with the more practical question of how to continue doing my job under lockdown. When the world shut down in March, a series of programmes I was working on was suddenly no longer feasible due to travel restrictions. I had a team ready to work but no projects. I made a podcast, Grounded With Louis Theroux. But I am a TV maker. What documentaries were possible that didn’t involve me leaving the house?Quite quickly, the idea of a retrospective show came up. The TV equivalent of a greatest hits album. Take the best bits from old programmes and link them together somehow using voiceover or maybe an interview with a director. The grammar could be figured out at a later stage. It was something we had thought about doing for a while – 2019 marked 25 years since I had started my career in television – but we never got round to it. But that was the pre-Covid thinking. In a world re-made by a virus, one of the many things that has changed is the appetite for archive-based television. Would we make four instead of one, the channel asked. Wow. OK. And like that, we went to work on an ambitious career retrospective with the title – dreamed up by me, and only partly because I secretly hoped it evoked subliminal thoughts of David Attenborough – Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge.Boiling down more than 50 hours of TV – not to mention the hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours of raw footage – turned out to be about as hard as you might expect. For a while I imagined it might be some kind of self-deconstruction of our processes. “An Adam Curtis kind of thing,” we airily said. “Show the bits you never see. The producer in shot. Programmes we never made.” This idea quickly evaporated in the heat of having to make a documentary that featured material viewers might actually want to see and that made some kind of sense. Instead we chose four themes that might impose an order on the material: belief, family, crime and the dark side of pleasure.These themes, while they were come by in a spirit of pragmatism, ended up giving us a coherence and cumulative logic that ended up being one of the greatest and most pleasurable discoveries of the whole process. Without realising it or intending it, it turns out the films I’ve been involved in making have captured a portrait of a changing culture, an oblique cultural history seen through the eyes of the people I have documented. This is true in obvious ways: given that I’ve made several films in jails and prison, and several others that involved immersion in police forces in major cities, it shouldn’t be surprising to look back and see the pre-history to the killing of George Floyd and the reaction to it, and the myriad ways in which they were both predicted and prefigured. What was more surprising was the way in which some of my older programmes contextualised and maybe explained the Trump phenomenon. The first episode of the series, about belief, features an Idaho-based second-amendment diehard with a penchant for apocalyptic conspiracy theories an elderly man with weird hair who’s in touch with UFOs a neo-Nazi family and a Vegas-based self-advertised multimillionaire and get-rich-quick guru. Having watched all these unlikely characters for 55 minutes, somehow when Donald Trump pops up at the end of the programme it is with an almost eerie feeling of inevitability.I also wanted to update stories by looking at what happened next – to the worlds they showed and the people involved in them. To an almost morbid extent, I circle around stories after completing them – I find it hard to let go and move on. Sometimes I stay in email contact with old subjects, or my team check in with them. Making Life on the Edge meant I had a reason to share the surprising developments in stories I had been tracking for years and also to reach out to other contributors I had long been curious to catch up with. Megan Phelps-Roper – who left the hate-spewing Westboro Baptist Church, founded by her grandfather Fred Phelps – has become a friend. She has published a book about her experiences and does talks on how to build bridges and communicate with people on the extremes (or simply people who disagree with you) in a way that they will hear. I spoke to her during the lockdown and we included a small portion of the conversation in the new series. I also spoke with JJ, the porn performer from Weird Weekends. He says he doesn’t regret a minute of being in the industry, describing it as an enriching and important part of his life. What you might think would be self-destructive, can sometimes end up being lifesaving.Of the various updates, one of the most moving for me, personally, was one I did about the aforementioned UFO believer with weird hair: the Rev Robert Short. Short was a “space channel”, meaning he could summon the personality of an entity, called Korton from the planet Koldas, and he would prognosticate in booming tones from an outbuilding at his unassuming house on the outskirts of Cornville, Arizona. I first saw him channel back in 1997, for a programme about aliens. It was a moment of comedy in the finished film. The weirdness of the voices and mannerisms and the outlandishness of Short’s claims couldn’t help coming across as funny. He died late last year, but we found some extraordinary footage that shows him, a year or two ago, though enfeebled and poignantly reduced, still channelling his alien friend. It’s almost as though he’s beaming to me from beyond the grave, and so, in a short space in the film we go from finding him amusing and maybe even ridiculous, to seeing him in a way that is wistful and rather moving.I suppose this ability to see a contributor in a new, more three-dimensional way brings up the question of changes in me. When I look at my own motivations and my own journey, I am forced to face the negative alongside the positive: a tendency, when younger, to maybe be glib, to disarm with the aim of making light of people’s deeply held beliefs, to act the clown, to make fun. That was part of how I saw my role, to be the straight man in a weird world, and there were times, looking back, when I see I may have gone too far. I also acknowledge my own sense of attraction to the dark side – the darkness of misguided beliefs and self-destructive behaviours. But – as I comment at the end of the programme dedicated to the dark side of pleasure – the aim of life shouldn’t be to avoid mistakes, to be sober, righteous and godly in everything, to be pious and upstanding and utterly bland. You have to wrap your arms around the whole of life, and – at the risk of sounding like my Las Vegas self-help guru friend – view your missteps as an important part of your journey.And it may be my mistakes – or at least the challenges I endured in order to change – that, looking back, I’m most attached to, because they suggested the possibility of doing things differently. After 25-plus years of doing my job, what strikes me is the development and evolution that has taken place. When I started out in 1994, it would have seemed ludicrous to imagine having the maturity, sensitivity and storytelling chops to make programmes about disability, mental health and addiction. Yet these are the themes that have dominated my most recent programmes – subjects such as eating disorders, dementia and brain injury. They sprang from a process that begun in 2011 when, stuck for subjects to cover, I made a documentary about dementia, even though I knew that for the first time I would be making a documentary in which no one was making a wrong or questionable choice. The success of that episode, and the pleasure of making it, led to other documentaries about families and relationships under stress from forces outside their control. They feature most in the final episode of our new series, about family. They involve people who are in different way vulnerable, struggling and doing the best that can as they battle the vicissitudes of fate. It’s a film that is, more than any of the others, about love. The rewards it brings, the emotional enrichment, how much we suffer in the course of preserving it and nurturing it, and the risk it entails: the possibility that in giving your heart away, it will be hurt.In The Importance of Being Earnest, Oscar Wilde defines fiction as requiring that the good end happily and the bad unhappily. It turns out, surprise surprise, the world isn’t like that. Making my programmes has been among other things, a reminder – were it needed – of how unfair life is, how hard many people have it and how much they have to overcome. Doing the work of documentary-presenting about people and worlds that are in different ways on the edge has left its marks on me, too. But so has 25 years of living, marrying, having children, moving countries, taking out the rubbish, loading and unloading the dishwasher, fighting with those close to me, failing in small duties, succeeding in others and performing the multitude of rituals that make up the bulk of what it is we call life. As I look out, with these eyes, with these thoughts, I don’t notice myself being so very different. I feel like the same person. The texture of my mind and my thought hasn’t changed. It is mainly when I see myself on screen that I see the change. I’m 50 now. The ravages of the ageing process have left their mark. My hair is grey, my eyes don’t work as well as they used to, my knees are going.If I looked like a plonker before, now I look like an old plonker. Maybe that’s progress.Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge is on BBC Two next month"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f35417cd0ba4e8d67f4b56f566922b7578753b4/0_333_4991_2994/master/4991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=215052b18ced0f55a0b4ff17edf1c904","title":"1100 year old gold coins found at dig site in israel","story":"Teenage volunteers on archaeological dig unearth 425 coins dating back to 9th centuryIsraeli teenagers volunteering at an archaeological dig have unearthed hundreds of gold coins that were stashed away in a clay vessel for more than a millennium.The 425 24-carat pure gold coins date back to the 9th-century Abbasid caliphate period and would have been a significant amount of money at the time, said Robert Kool, a coin expert at the Israel Antiquities Authority.“For example, with such a sum a person could buy a luxurious house in one of the best neighbourhoods in Fustat, the enormous wealthy capital of Egypt in those days,” he said.The treasure was discovered last week at an excavation site in central Israel where a new neighbourhood is planned to be built.The excavation director, Liat Nadav-Ziv, said: “The person who buried this treasure 1,100 years ago must have expected to retrieve it and even secured the vessel with a nail so that it would not move. We can only guess what prevented him from returning to collect this treasure.”It is thought the area housed workshops at the time the treasure was hidden. The identity of the owner is a mystery.“It was amazing,” said Oz Cohen, one of the volunteers who found the treasure. “I dug in the ground and, when I excavated the soil, saw what looked like very thin leaves. When I looked again I saw these were gold coins. It was really exciting to find such a special and ancient treasure.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88df470f628ace22a8fc8b5788608a441a827a2b/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4816ab0fd094da59025deee0f33d7c23","title":"ardern says 2020 has been frankly terrible as auckland lockdown extended","story":"Masks made mandatory on public transport across New Zealand as coronavirus cases continue to riseNew Zealand’s biggest city will remain in lockdown until midnight on Sunday, the extra four days necessitated by the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said.A total of 101 people have been infected by the outbreak in south Auckland, making it the largest cluster in New Zealand.Ardern said the cluster would have been significantly bigger if level three restrictions had not been imposed so quickly, as people had become infected at churches, shopping centres and on public buses.“If it weren’t for level three, this cluster would be exponential, of that I have no doubt,” she said on Monday.“This is a contained cluster. But it is our biggest one. And that means the tail will be long, and the cases will keep coming for a while to come.”Ardern also announced that from Monday masks on public transport would be mandatory country-wide, although some, such as those with severe breathing difficulties, would be exempt.Speaking to New Zealanders who have been demoralised by the second wave of the virus after 102 days of being Covid-free, Ardern acknowledged that 2020 had been exceptionally hard.“If it feels hard – that’s because it has been,” she said. “But let’s also remember, in a world where 2020 has frankly been terrible, we are strong, we have been kind, and we are doing really well.”The source of the outbreak is unidentified, and health authorities say it may never be known.Epidemiological experts welcomed the lockdown extension and said it was the best way to eliminate the virus again.“There are almost certainly still active, unidentified cases in the community with the potential to spark new outbreaks if we relax too soon,” said Prof Michael Plank of Te Pūnaha Matatini.“The cases we have seen as a result of contacts between strangers on bus journeys are an example of how quickly this outbreak could spread. “Provided the recent trend of cases continues, the extra four days at level three will give us a better chance of containing this cluster. We should also remember there is still a risk of the outbreak spreading outside Auckland.”Associate Prof Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist and public health communicator from the University of Auckland, agreed.“This is a pragmatic decision to ensure the current cluster is fully contained,” she said. “The last thing we want is to miss some cases that then turn into further community transmission.”However, resistance to the lockdown is growing in Auckland. Dozens of people joined an anti-lockdown protest in the city at the weekend, saying their rights were being breached.There are also daily reports that Aucklanders are failing to adhere to the lockdown rules as strictly as they did the first time.Dr Dougal Sutherland, a clinical psychologist at Victoria University of Wellington, said the lockdown extension would be “disheartening” for many.“Whereas the first lockdown was accompanied by an increase in anxiety for some, the recent return to level three seemed to bring with it a collective downturn in mood,” he said.“The government announcement today could further erode our collective sense of hope.”Auckland’s mayor, Phil Goff, urged Aucklanders to stay calm and stay the course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfb59d46eecc4318f8c6ec887ab0776446400f9/0_182_5467_3281/master/5467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da91b247736b5b1d89018ea08ba3d85b","title":"coronavirus home test kits run out in england and scotland","story":"People told to travel long distances to test centres because daily allocation has been takenEngland and Scotland ran out of coronavirus home testing kits within hours on Monday, amid a backlog in laboratories.People were advised to travel long distances to test centres after being told that the daily allowance of home tests had run out.Callers to the NHS 119 number for Covid-19 were told: “We’re very sorry – the available allocation has already been issued at this time.”The reason behind the apparent shortage is unclear, but laboratories have been struggling to clear a backlog of tests since the end of July. The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for a comment.The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, announced on 28 April that his department was increasing the number of home testing kits available from 5,000 a day to 25,000 a day by the end of that week.Several people expressed their displeasure on social media after trying unsuccessfully to order a home test on Monday. One man said he had been told to travel to a testing site 36 miles away in Tiverton, south Devon, despite living closer to two testing sites.Another wrote to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, saying there were no available slots at regional testing sites “within 100 miles of Glasgow” on Monday.The UK government does not release figures on how many home testing kits are posted out each day but the number of results recorded from them remains well below 25,000 a day.In the most recent week for which figures are available, an average of 16,000 results a day were recorded from home testing kits although the number has steadily increased over the past three months.Home test kits make up about one in four of all coronavirus tests carried out each week in the UK. The self-administered test, in which a swab must be inserted deep into the user’s throat and nose, is far more convenient for those who do not have access to a vehicle or live in remote locations far from the privately run testing sites.The time taken to produce results from coronavirus tests has risen sharply in recent weeks, owing to an IT failure and an increase in the number of tests being carried out.The government said the worsening turnaround times were due to an IT systems failure at one of the laboratories which resulted in a delay to the processing of results. It added that the increase of tests had also resulted in backlogs in some laboratories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1199f987999f45a5f91b7e208570ac216edc2bb7/0_91_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=994f279ec85dec726d53140b911cb738","title":"with a word of tamil kamala harris boosts her fanbase in india","story":"Pride in US VP candidate particularly strong in Tamil Nadu village where her grandfather was bornAs a child wandering between the legs of the aunts, uncles and family friends who filled her grandparents’ apartment in Chennai, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, a young Kamala Harris grew used to being addressed in Tamil.It was the main language spoken by her grandmother, who had only fragmented English, and over the years of Harris’s childhood trips from California to Chennai – which back then was called Madras – to visit her mother’s side of the family, she slowly learned to understand, if not speak, the mother tongue of her Indian relatives.Standing at the Democratic convention podium last week accepting her historic nomination for US vice-president, Harris made a passing but significant nod to this aspect of her heritage. She said her mother had “raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage”, adding: “Family is my uncles, my aunts and my chithis.”Harris is the first candidate of Indian descent to be on a US presidential ticket, and her use of chithi, the Tamil term of endearment meaning “auntie”, sent reverberations through south Asian households in the US and also those watching 8,000 miles away in India.“I literally have tears in my eyes,” tweeted the model and chef Padma Lakshmi, who like Harris’s mother was born in Chennai and moved to the US. “Kamala Harris just said ‘chithis’ which means auntie. My heart is so full right now.”Harris’s use of Tamil in her speech has boosted her growing fanbase in India, particularly in the tiny eastern Tamil Nadu village of Painganadu where her grandfather PV Gopalan was born in 1911 and which Harris visited once as a child with her grandmother.In the past week posters have appeared all over the village, emblazoned with Harris’s face and bearing slogans expressing local pride, wishing her good luck and describing her as “lion-hearted”.Bharathi Selvam, 27, whose grandfather knew Harris’s grandfather, was among those in Painganadu who organised for the posters to be hung up in the village tea shop and on every lane. “It is a very proud moment for us,” he said. “We have all become very active, everyone has put up signs supporting her and started reading about American politics. We have all been offering prayers for her, so I am sure she will win.”Harris’s Indian side of the family still send financial donations to the Dharma Shastra temple in the village, and her name, alongside those of her relatives, is carved into the temple wall. The temple’s administrator SV Ramanam, 71, said Harris’s aunt Sarala Gopalan had asked him to perform a small prayer ritual to offer good luck for her niece. “The villagers are very elated at this news,” said Ramanam.Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, left India aged 19 after being offered a part-funded PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. According to Harris and her Indian relatives, Shyamala ensured that her two daughters did not lose touch with their Indian heritage despite growing up in America.Every few years Shyamala, who worked as a cancer research scientist and was also a renowned singer of traditional Carnatic music, would bring her daughters to Chennai to visit her retired grandparents, and Harris would take formative walks with her grandfather along the beach. Harris was not able to come back to India for the funeral of her grandfather, who died suddenly in 1999, but she returned to Chennai beach to scatter the ashes of her mother, who died of cancer in 2009.In a speech last week at a “South Asians for Biden” event, Harris spoke of her times in Chennai. “Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry,” she recalled. “And of course, she always wanted to instil in us a love of good idli.”Harris’s bonds with the Indian side of her family have remained tight and they all flew out to Washington for her inauguration as a senator in 2017.“We are naturally very proud,” said Harris’s uncle G Balachandran, 79, who lives in Delhi. “This has brought great happiness to us all in her family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/775aefb40bf29c1aaa7e19f4621b830f692ff41a/0_105_3065_1840/master/3065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d3f11203ea139d9fa60d1396b2cdc08","title":"coronavirus live news send children to school uk pm urges france sees highest cases since may","story":"Man cleared of virus in April but has now tested positive again France to impose reciprocal quarantine on travellers returning from UK ‘Very low evidence’ for plasma therapy authorised by Trump — WHOA Hong Kong man who recovered from Covid-19 was infected again four-and-a-half months later in the first documented instance of human re-infection, researchers at the University of Hong Kong said on Monday.The findings indicate the disease, which has killed more than 800,000 people worldwide, will continue to spread amongst the global population despite herd immunity, they said.The 33-year-old male was cleared of Covid-19 and discharged from a hospital in April, but tested positive again after returning from Spain via Britain on 15 August.The patient had appeared to be previously healthy, researchers said in the paper, which was accepted by the international medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.He was found to have contracted a different coronavirus strain from the one he had previously contracted and remained asymptomatic for the second infection.The World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said on Monday there was no need to jump to any conclusions in response to the Hong Kong case.Instances of people discharged from hospitals and testing positive again for Covid-19 infection have been reported in mainland China.However, in those cases it was not clear whether they had contracted the virus again after full recovery – as happened to the Hong Kong patient – or still had the virus in their body from the initial infection.One explanation was that the virus still existed in the lungs of patients but was not detected in samples taken from upper parts of the respiratory tract, he said. Other possible causes were low sensitivity of tests and weak immunity that could lead to persistent positive results, he added.In Greece, teachers and students will be required to wear masks in class and indoor spaces when schools reopen in September, Reuters reports.The rise in coronavirus cases in recent weeks has forced Greek authorities to gradually reimpose restrictions to curb the spread of Coronavirus.Education minister Niki Kerameus said schools are expected to reopen on 7 September but an extension may be deemed necessary.Mask-wearing will be mandatory in all indoor spaces of schools across the country, she said, adding that authorities will offer fabric masks for free to students and teachers.The number of pupils in each class will be limited to 17.On Sunday, Greece reported 284 new cases, a new daily record since its first case surfaced in February. In total, the country has registered 8,664 Covid-19 infections and 242 deaths.Italy has started human testing of a Covid-19 vaccine, developed by scientists at the Spallanzani hospital in Rome.The first volunteer, a 50 year old woman, told Italian news agency ANSA she was “proud and hoped to be useful to our country”.The vaccine has been produced by the Italian biotechnology firm, ReiThera, of Castel Romano, near Rome, and doctors say they hope to produce it by next spring. Testing is currently limited to 90 volunteers, selected from over 5,000 applicants.The scientific chief of Spallanzani, Giuseppe Ippolito, has said “Italy will not be the slave of other countries” in the vaccine field.Health Minister, Roberto Speranza, said “Italian research has met the challenge.”The Polish government has insisted schools will reopen next week for the first time since mid-March despite reaching a record high number of daily registered coronavirus infections late last week.Poland was at first successful in containing the outbreak, but cases have started rising in recent weeks and on Friday authorities reported 903 new infections, the highest daily increase to date.The rise in infections has caused concern among some parents contemplating sending their children back to class.“Every child, teenager, goes out on the street or to the store and can get infected there. I don’t see the need to postpone the beginning of the (school) year,” Education Minister Dariusz Piontkowski told a news conference, reiterating the government’s position.Children will not be required to wear face masks in classrooms, but inidual principals may decide to impose this obligation in school halls and locker rooms. No temperature checks are to be introduced.The ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) imposed strict restrictions in March to curb the spread of the virus and started easing them in May, which critics said was to encourage Poles to vote in the presidential election.In July, prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki downplayed infection risks, saying Poles, including elderly citizens, should not be afraid to vote because the novel coronavirus had become a disease “like any other”.The country of 38 million has reported 62,310 cases in all, and 1,960 deaths.Here’s a little more detail on those comments from the World Health Organisation’s director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has warned against “vaccine nationalism” and said global competition to create one could lead to prices spiking “exponentially”, which would only prolong the crisis.Instead, as we reported earlier, Tedros has urged countries to support the Covax vaccines facility.We’re working with vaccine manufacturers to provide all countries that join the effort timely and equitable access to all vaccines, licensed and approved.This doesn’t just pool risk, it also means that prices will be kept as low as possible. New research outlines that global competition for vaccine doses could lead to prices spiking exponentially in comparison to collaborative efforts, such as the Covax facility.It would also lead to a prolonged pandemic as only a small number of countries would get most of the supply. Vaccine nationalism only helps the virus. Covax aims to ensure that low, middle and high-income countries all receive the vaccine in a “timely way” as soon as there is enough supply, Tedros said.However, he warned that the scheme’s success hinged not only on countries signing up to it, but also “filling key funding gaps” for research and development work, and to support the lower-income economies involved.An Italian hospital has said it has inoculated a first volunteer with a vaccine as part of human trials expected to last six months, Agence France-Presse (AFP) has reported.The woman, in her 50s, received the first dose developed by the Rome-based biotech company ReiThera at the capital’s Spallanzani Institute for infectious diseases. The trials, developed between ReiThera and Spallanzani researchers, will be carried out on 90 volunteers ided into groups by age to test the efficacy of different dosages of the vaccine, developed since March. If the first results of phase 1 of the human trials prove positive, researchers say they will be able to proceed to phases 2 and 3 by the end of the year, on a larger number of volunteers including outside of Italy. The vaccine has already passed pre-clinical tests on animal models. Giuseppe Ippolito, the institute’s scientific director, said:It will take at least 24 weeks to complete phase 1 of human trials of the vaccine.Countries are racing to develop their own vaccines against the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 800,000 people around the world. “Having an Italian vaccine means not being slaves and servants of other countries that will say ‘me first’,” said Ippolito, who said he hoped the vaccine would be ready for use by spring 2021.Financial markets around the world have rallied strongly after the US government approved a new coronavirus treatment using the plasma of recovered patients, and as hopes rise for the development of a vaccine.Against a backdrop of rising optimism that medical advances could help to sustain a stronger economic recovery from the pandemic, stocks in Europe climbed higher on Monday after gains in Asia overnight.The company manufacturing the Oxford University coronavirus vaccine has denied it is in talks with the Trump administration about fast-tracking its vaccine for emergency use ahead of November’s presidential elections, Peter Beaumont and Sarah Boseley write.With both Russia and China pressing ahead with inoculations involving experimental vaccines yet to pass final efficacy and safety trials, the Trump administration has become increasingly frustrated with the Food and Drug Administration, which the president has tried to suggest is slowing approval of a vaccine for “political reasons”.In a statement released following a report in the Financial Times, the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca insisted it had “not discussed emergency use authorisation with the US government and it would be premature to speculate on that possibility”.The number of new Covid infections continues to rise in Italy, our southern Italy correspondent reports.A further 1,210 people tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday, the sharpest daily rise since May, when the country was in lockdown.About half of the 1,210 new cases are holidaymakers returning from Croatia, Greece, Spain and Malta – but also from Sardinia.The Italian island has been recording an increase in Covid positive tourists in recent days. With many domestic tourists taking ferries to and from Sardinia, the mainland region of Lazio set up a testing facility at the dock at Civitavecchia, so those driving vehicles off the ferries could line up for immediate testing on their return home.The latest cases have pushed up the overall national tally since the start of the emergency to 259,345. The death toll is 35,437.Italy’s first wave of the pandemic was brutal, with more than 250,000 infections, peaking at about 6,000 cases a day in March. Despite the surge in coronavirus cases, the government has said there are no plans for a new lockdown.Reuters news agency reports the latest remarks from Sweden’s top epidemiologist and architect of its unorthodox pandemic strategy.Sweden is likely to see local outbreaks but no big second wave of Covid-19 cases in the autumn, such as inundated hospitals a few months ago, Anders Tegnell said on Monday.Sweden has been an outlier in Europe’s fight against the novel coronavirus, keeping businesses, restaurants and most schools open throughout the pandemic, while not recommending the use of face masks, which remain a rare sight on city streets.Per capita, Sweden has suffered many times more Covid-19 deaths than its Nordic neighbours, though not quite as many as Europe’s worst-hit countries such as Belgium, Spain and Britain.New cases, hospitalisations and mortality have fallen sharply over the past couple of months. With most Swedes having returned from summer vacations and schools reopening last week for the new semester, there are concerns the country could see a second wave of infections.In an interview with broadcaster TV4, Tegnell said:“We don’t believe we’ll have a classic second wave, such as those seen in influenza pandemics where you get widespread contagion in the community again.This disease appears to work in a different way. The spread is more patchy, so the likelihood is greater that we will see – as one is currently seeing around Europe – outbreaks in certain places, at workplaces and similar environments, during the autumn.With the Swedish death toll nearing 6,000 people, including many nursing home residents who succumbed during March, April and May, Tegnell and the pandemic strategy he champions has ided opinion both at home and abroad.A group of scientists that has long been critical of the country’s response, sometimes engaging in fierce argument with Tegnell, this month warned of a renewed spread of the virus as schools reopened, calling on authorities to step up safeguards.“I think one should always be worried about this disease because it is constantly causing new mischief and is very unpredictable,” Tegnell said. “But that we would return to the situation we had during the spring – we don’t see that.”The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is investigating the circumstances surrounding Irish commissioner Phil Hogan’s attendance at a golf event that may have breached Covid guidelines.Brussels said Hogan, the EU’s trade commissioner, had given an account of his actions to the president, but she had requested further clarification from him.European commission spokesman Dana Spinant told reporters there were “moral aspects” involved in the need to follow coronavirus rules, as well as legal ones:“We feel for the people of Ireland who, like many other people and communities in the European Union over the past months, had to go through difficult times to comply with strict regulations in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” she said.“Many have lost loved ones, many others have been ill and others have suffered from the restrictions. So this is why it is important that rules are respected. This is a matter not just of respecting the rules, but this is also a matter of public health. There are legal aspects involved and there are moral aspects involved as well.”Hogan was asked on Saturday by Ireland’s prime minister and deputy prime minister to consider his position after his attendance at a golf dinner caused public outrage and led to other political resignations.Hogan offered his initial apology on Friday only after the prime minister, Micheál Martin, demanded one."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We need to rethink the value we place on the natural environmentActivist says ongoing denial about scale of crisis contrasts with urgency of Covid fightEvaluation suggests using ecosystem thresholds to develop policies is not best approach"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File image: Dara Mac DónaillThe Phil Hogan was stopped by a garda while in Kildare, on route from Kilkenny to Clifden, for using his mobile phone while driving.Mr Hogan’s spokesman said he was cautioned and he did not receive penalty points.Earlier on Sunday, Mr Hogan’s spokesman said the Commissioner will not be resigning from his position, as controversy continued over his attendance at this week’s Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.Mr Hogan said he wished to apologise “fully and unreservedly” for attending the event along with more than 80 people.A Garda investigation is underway into the event, which took place just a day after the Government had decided to further limit the size of indoor gatherings under Covid-19 regulations to combat the spread of the virus.In a further development on Sunday, the golf society’s president Donie Cassidy has resigned as vice president of Fianna Fáil.The former TD and senator was among those involved in organising the event and made a speech at it.In his statement earlier on Sunday, Mr Hogan said: “I want, in particular, to apologise to the wonderful healthcare workers, who continue to put their lives on the line to combat Covid-19 and all people who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. I acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of Ireland, something for which I am profoundly sorry.“I realise fully the unnecessary stress, risk and offense caused to the people of Ireland by my attendance at such an event, at such a difficult time for all, and I am extremely sorry for this.“I acknowledge that the issue is far bigger than compliance with rules and regulations and adherence to legalities and procedures. All of us must display solidarity as we try to stamp out this common plague.“I thus offer this fulsome and profound apology, at this difficult time for all people, as the world as a whole combats Covid-19.“I spoke to both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste yesterday and I have listened carefully to their views, which I respect. I have been reporting to the President of the European Commission on all these matters in recent days.”A spokesperson confirmed in a statement to The  that Mr Hogan would not be resigning.Tánaiste and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar\u0026nbsptold RTÉ’s This Week programme that Mr Hogan’s apology on Sunday for attending the dinner in breach of public health guidelines had helped the situation.“It would have been better if it had come sooner but it definitely helps,” he said.“We need to make it clear to Commissioner Hogan and to the Irish people that we don’t condone his actions we are not accountable for them we are not going to defend them at all. It is up to him to account for his actions, to explain them and to satisfy people,” said Mr Varadkar.‘Consider his position’On Saturday Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Mr Varadkar asked Mr Hogan to “consider his position” as EU Commissioner after attending the event.“They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner’s apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his action,” a Government spokesperson said on Saturday.Mr Hogan’s future as European Commissioner for Trade remains in doubt and the intervention on Saturday by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is also likely to increase pressure on Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who was also in attendance at the golf dinner.Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar have not spoken to European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen, who would have the power to remove Mr Hogan from office.On Sunday, Labour leader Alan Kelly urged the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to “inform” Ms Von der Leyen “that they no longer have confidence” in Mr Hogan and that he should resign.Mr Hogan’s appointment as Commissioner was ratified by the European Parliament after being nominated by the previous government.Event durationMeanwhile, the Oireachtas Golf Society is coming under further pressure to disclose the length of time more than 80 people were gathered at the dinner.Under Covid-19 restrictions announced by Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar two weeks ago, restaurants were required to close at 11pm, with diners allowed only an hour and 45 minutes for their meals.Revised restrictions announced last Tuesday – the night before the now infamous golf dinner – extended the closing time until 11.30pm, with table numbers capped at six people.One of those in attendance at Wednesday night’s dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, said it started shortly after 9pm.There were a choice of three starters, including soup, pate and “some vegetarian or salady thing”, followed by a choice of three main courses, including salmon and lamb, and a choice of three desserts.After the meal there were four separate speeches, including from society captain and Independent TD Noel Grealish and Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, who spoke on behalf of his family.The dinner was organised to pay tribute to his late father, the former Fianna Fáil MEP and TD Mark Killilea, as well as mark the society’s 50th anniversary.The now resigned minister for agriculture Dara Calleary also made a speech commemorating the late Mr Killilea.There was also a prize-giving, and according to one person present, families of winners took time to take photos.It is understood former Fine Gael minister Mr Hogan won one of the prizes, a George Foreman grill.One attendee couldn’t recall what time people left the function room, saying some stayed on to talk afterwards before everyone “scattered”.“It’s impossible to say, I wasn’t conscious of time,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.‘Multiple breaches’Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald told The  she was concerned “to hear reports of multiple breaches of public health guidelines” at the event.“We know the number of attendees exceeded the limit, but it has now been alleged that the event also lasted far longer than the time limit permitted,” she said.“The public needs to know if multiple breaches of the guidelines occurred.“I would ask those present at the dinner to clarify whether the length of time was compliant with the regulations and to be clear about how many regulation breaches took place. The attendees must be up-front about what happened and how the rules were breached. ”Ms McDonald said the Irish public was “understandably concerned about what happened and this drip feed of information and allegations risks undermining confidence in the public health guidelines at this critical time in the fight against Covid-19”.Some attendees stayed at rooms in the hotel where the dinner took place and others stayed in at least two other hotels in the town. Some remained on at the hotel lounge in the lobby afterwards.“We were assured everything was in order,” one said.“It was a cock up anyway, with the benefit of hindsight. The dinner shouldn’t have taken place.”As well as the more than 80 attendees, there was “a pile” of staff, with one or two waiters assigned to each table, according to one of the diners.Restrictions state staff should be included when calculating maximum numbers, meaning the gathering was several multiples of the latest allowed number of six for indoor gatherings, and comfortably more than the previous cap of 50.Mr Cassidy has said he will fully cooperate with a Garda investigation into the affair.Under Covid-19 regulations it is a criminal offence to organise an event with a larger number of people than is permitted by the regulations.All-expenses tripThe scandal is not the first time the Oireachtas Golf Society has courted controversy.In the summer of 2010, the society went on an all-expenses paid trip to Turkey for official celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the Turkish parliament, which had organised a golf tournament for parliamentarians from around the globe.Among those travelling were Mr Cassidy, Mr Grealish and then Carlow Kilkenny TD Mr Hogan.Then leader of the Seanad Mr Cassidy was forced to deny claims on his return that he had refused to reopen the Upper House alongside the Dáil the same week because he and his golfing colleagues were staying at the five star Sueno Hotels Golf Belek resort in the popular coastal resort Antalya.“I gave up my whole bloody weekend in the name of Ireland,” he said of his trip to Turkey at the time."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337593.1598281036!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"timeline how phil hogan became the centre of the golf dinner controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU commissioner Phil Hogan is facing calls to resign over his attendance at a golf society event in Co Galway. File photograph: Nick BradshawThe EU commissioner Phil Hogan has been at the centre of a major political controversy, as one of several high-profile politicians who attended an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner last week that had more than 80 guests, in apparent breach of public health guidelines amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He is facing calls to resign and scrutiny over his account of his movements after arriving back in Ireland. Here is the timeline of his role in the controversy: July 30th: European Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan arrived in Ireland from Brussels. Earlier that day he had a video call on trade reform and US-China relations, according to his diary. Under public health guidelines, people arriving into Ireland from non-green-list countries, such as Belgium, must restrict their movements for 14 days. HSE advice outlines that this means “avoiding contact with other people and social situations as much as possible”. After arriving in Ireland Mr Hogan was self-isolating at a residence he owns at the K Club, in Straffan, Co Kildare. August 5th: Mr Hogan travelled to Dublin for a medical appointment, and stayed in a health facility overnight, where he was also tested for Covid-19 and received a negative result.After his stay in the Dublin medical clinic he travelled to stay with a family member in Kilkenny for a period of convalescence. August 8th: Following a spike in coronavirus cases linked to several outbreaks, counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly were put into an effective lockdown by the Government for two weeks. The new restrictions meant people in the three counties would be allowed to travel only within their county, unless for work, medical, or family reasons. People who had to pass through the affected counties were asked not to stop while travelling through the area. Public health rules for the rest of the country at this point restricted numbers attending indoor gatherings, such as weddings or other functions, to a strict limit of 50 people. August 18th: Last Tuesday the Oireachtas Golf Society two-day 50th anniversary event kicked off at Connemara Championship Golf Links, Ballyconneely, Co Galway. Tee times for the captain’s prize four-ball began from 11am. As the politicians and other attendees at the event were making their way around the 18 holes of the championship links course, a lengthy Cabinet meeting was under way that afternoon.Shortly before 6pm in Dublin, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced public health restrictions were being tightened, to combat the recent increase in Covid-19 cases in the State. The new measures included a limit for indoor gatherings of six people. August 19th: The second day of the event started with another round of golf for the president’s prize, followed that evening by dinner at the Station House Hotel, in Clifden, at 8.30pm. Mr Hogan was seated at the top table, with society captain Noel Grealish TD, Mr Calleary and his wife Siobhan, and former Fianna Fáil minister Noel Dempsey and his wife Bernadette, according to the seating plan. August 20th: At 7pm the Irish Examiner broke the story of the dinner online under the headline: “Minister and 80 people at golf event in breach of public health guidelines.” August 21st: The political and public outrage was swift, with several resignations on Friday morning amid the backlash. Mr Calleary resigned as minister for agriculture, Senator Jerry Buttimer resigned as leas-chathaoirleach of the Seanad. The party whip was also removed from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Senators who attended. At 10.58am Mr Hogan released his first statement addressing his attendance at the golf society dinner.The former Fine Gael minister said he had attended it “on the clear understanding that the organisers and the hotel concerned had been assured by the Irish Hotels Federation that the arrangements proposed to be put in place would be in compliance with the Government’s guidelines”.He added that he had “complied fully with the Government’s quarantine requirements, having been in Ireland since late July”.Mr Hogan’s team began to field press queries digging into the commissioner’s movements between his return from Brussels in late July and the golf event, based on questions about whether he had spent time in Co Kildare. A spokesman for Mr Hogan told The  at about 11.30am: “I’m not going to get into details of the commissioner’s personal movements, other than to assure you that he did not breach the lockdown rules to attend the golf event.”Later another statement from his spokesman clarified that Mr Hogan “fulfilled quarantineself-isolation requirements in accordance with Government requirements following his return to Ireland at the end of July. I can confirm that he did not breach Government guidelines relating to Co Kildare.”Following continued pressure, Mr Hogan’s spokesman released a further statement detailing his movements upon arriving in Ireland. “Mr Hogan left Kildare to fulfil a medical appointment prior to the implementation of the lockdown and went from there to Kilkenny for a period of convalescence and then went to Connemara for the golf tournament.Speaking on RTÉ’s Six One News, Mr Martin said he believed Mr Hogan should apologise for attending the dinner. “I would like a meaningful response to the mood of the public and the anger of the public towards this issue,” he said.Following this intervention, Mr Hogan released a statement clarifying he “does apologise for any distress caused by his attendance” at the dinner. Shortly afterwards his spokesman sent out a revised statement which said that Mr Hogan apologised for his attendance, with the reference to “any distress caused” removed.August 22nd: Mr Hogan returned to Brussels on Saturday. In a statement that evening, both Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar said they had asked him to “consider his position” as EU commissioner over the debacle. August 23rd: Despite continuing pressure, Mr Hogan’s spokesman reiterated that the commissioner would not be resigning from his post. At 12.20pm Mr Hogan released a furtherlengthy further statement, apologising “fully and unreservedly” for attending the dinner. “I acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of Ireland, something for which I am profoundly sorry. I realise fully the unnecessary stress, risk and offence caused to the people of Ireland by my attendance at such an event, at such a difficult time for all, and I am extremely sorry for this,” he said. There was another significant development in the story just after 9pm. It transpired that Mr Hogan had been stopped by a garda for using his mobile phone while driving to the golf society event. He had been stopped while in Co Kildare – a county under lockdown – while en route from Kilkenny to Clifden on August 17th. The new revelations called into question previous statements emphatically denying he had breached restrictions in Co Kildare. Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Mr Martin said he would be concerned if Mr Hogan had breached the lockdown restrictions in Co Kildare. The Taoiseach said he would like a “very comprehensive statement” from Mr Hogan to explain fully his position in relation to the restrictions in Co Kildare. In Brussels, Mr Hogan presented a report on the controversy to president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, who is considering the matter, and, crucially, has the power to remove him from office."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337457.1598271925!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"von der leyen requests clarifications after hogan hands over dossier on golf dinner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU Commissioner Phil Hogan who has been asked for more information by  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Photograph: Bloomberg European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has asked for further clarification from Ireland’s Commissioner Phil Hogan after receiving a dossier describing his movements in the country because “details count” a spokeswoman has said.Mr Hogan is under pressure after it emerged that initial statements by his spokesman claiming he travelled “directly” from Co Kilkenny to the controversial golf event in Co Galway were incorrect.Mr Hogan’s team have since admitted he returned to Co Kildare on his way to the golf event, to collect items from his residence at the K-Club, and was stopped by gardaí in the county for using his mobile phone while driving.A spokesman for the European Commission had on Friday also repeated that Mr Hogan travelled to Co Galway “directly”.“This is a matter that requires careful assessment on our side. This is a matter where details count. Therefore the president has requested Commission Hogan to provide a full report covering the matters,” European Commission spokeswoman Dana Spinant said.“The President has received such a report from Commissioner Hogan last night. She is now looking at it. Details are important as I said. The President has requested further clarifications because details are important and she wishes to have them.”Trade portfolioMs von der Leyen has the power to dismiss Mr Hogan, who is in charge of the vital trade portfolio at a time of crucial sensitivity amid a trade war between the United States and China and with time running out to clinch agreement with Britain about its future trade relations with the EU following Brexit.Ms Spinant said that so far the Commission’s work on trade had been able to continue, and that it was vital that this remained the case.“It’s important to ensure that nothing distracts the Commission from its very important work, in particular at these times when we need to deal with a serious crisis provoked by the Coronavirus, ” the spokeswoman said.Mr Hogan had presented a dossier to Ms von der Leyen last night and was then subsequently asked for more detail.The Commission spokeswoman indicated she expected Mr Hogan, who has yet to appear in public to take questions from journalists, would make a public appearance.“We feel for the people of Ireland who like many other people and communities in the European Union over the past months had to go through difficult times to comply with strict regulations to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. Many have lost loved ones, many have been ill and others have suffered from the restrictions,” Ms Spinant said.“So this is why it is important that rules are respected. This is a matter not just on respecting the rules but this is also a matter of public health. There are legal aspects involved and there are moral aspects involved as well.”It is understood Mr Hogan’s dossier has not yet been provided to senior members of the Irish Government.The Government will now await Ms von der Leyen’s judgment on the report and any additional information from Mr Hogan.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has not spoken to Ms von der Leyen about Mr Hogan’s future, indicating that, if she is satisfied with the former Fine Gael minister’s explanations, the Government will not seek his removal as commissioner.Officials in Dublin and Brussels said she is expected to make a decision about Mr Hogan’s future after considering his account.Ms von der Leyen, who is said by her spokesman to be “following the situation closely”, requested the detailed report from Mr Hogan about his attendance at the dinner and travel in Ireland prior to the event after new revelations emerged.Senior politiciansMr Hogan was one of more than 80 people, including a number of senior politicians and a member of the judiciary, who attend the dinner in Clifden, Co Galway last Wednesday, in apparent contravention of Covid-19 restrictions.On Monday Martin said a statement he issued on Saturday evening with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar calling for Mr Hogan to consider his position was released after emerged that he had been stopped by gardaí, Micheál Martin said on Friday.Mr Martin said on Monday he was very angry over the dinner in Galway and said it should not have happened.Mr Martin also confirmed that Dara Calleary, who resigned as Minister for Agriculture on Friday, has also resigned as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil.Yesterday Mr Hogan’s spokesman confirmed he went from Kilkenny to the K-Club on his way to Clifden last week to collect personal belongings and “essential” work papers.Mr Hogan’s spokesman said he was cautioned and he did not receive penalty points.On Saturday evening, following consultations with the Green Party leader, Eamon Ryan, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar called for Mr Hogan to “consider his position”.Uncompromising noteMr Varadkar sounded a less uncompromising note on Sunday when he said Mr Hogan’s second - and more contrite - apology “definitely helps”.However, Mr Varadkar said he needed to provide further explanations, especially about whether he may have broken the terms of the local lockdown in Co Kildare, where he has a residence at the K-Club golf resort.“He needs to answer any questions that people have,” Mr Varadkar said. “That’s not just in relation to the dinner, it’s also any questions that might arise from his movements within the country and his movements in and out of Co Kildare.”If Mr Hogan is unable to do this, “then he needs to consider his position”.Meanwhile, gardaí have been in contact with staff at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, where the Oireachtas Golf Society function was held.The Garda investigation into the gathering is focused on how the event was organised. Under current Covid-19 regulations, organising a large event is not permitted. The ban or organising an event is a penal provision meaning any proven breach is a criminal offence, though attending an event is not prohibited by law."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"White supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ministry defence told make new 15bn fleet ships britain","story":"The Ministry of Defence must make the new £1.5billion fleet of ships in Britain otherwise the UK is at risk of losing its shipbuilding skills forever, Labour has warned. \u2028The warning comes after the MoD asked potential suppliers to take part in market engagement about the major contract to build three Fleet Solid Support (FSS) ships that will help keep the Royal Navy\u0027s new aircraft carriers at sea, providing them with stores such as ammunition and food.The “prior information notice” on the MoD contracts website adds that it is open to “UK and international suppliers or consortiums offering a UK or international ship design, who are capable of either priming, providing a design andor integrating or building FSS ships”.Five years ago the Government announced it would build three support ships, although an order is yet to be placed, meanwhile the National Audit Office recently highlighted the lack of support ships as a potential weakness in the MoD’s plans for the deployment of the carriers.\u2028John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, told The : “If we fail to back British skills we risk losing them for good and weakening both our security and industrial base for the future.” Mr Healey accused defence ministers of having “dithered over this decision” for five years, “when it’s a no-brainer to build these vital new ships in Britain”. \u2028“They are selling Britain short by not putting the work into UK shipyards.

Frankly, this is a place where you come to meet people. No one comes here to play cards.”The local newspaper, L’Indépendant, described the resort as a “temple of libertinism”.However, a spokesman for its management said: “Our customers are disciplined and they have respected health rules and barrier gestures. I don’t think you can say that people have been more careless here than anywhere else.”The rate of infection among naturists at the Cap d’Agde resort on the Mediterranean coast is four times higher than in the local village, according to the regional health authority. Face masks are now mandatory and a number of bars and night clubs have been closed in the fenced-off “Village Naturiste”, which attracts about 35,000 visitors each summer.The health authority has issued a warning for the resort, saying the number of infections was “very worrying”.It is advising holidaymakers without serious symptoms to return home by car and avoid public transport.The outbreak came as new cases in France hit another post-lockdown record, with nearly 4,900 cases reported over 24-hours on Sunday. It is the highest daily number since May and has heightened fears of a second coronavirus wave as families return to French cities after summer holidays.Olivier Véran, the health minister, said it was mainly 20- to 40-year-olds being infected at parties, but cases are beginning to rise among older people too.France has ramped up testing to about 700,000 a week, Mr Véran said. Cases are being detected earlier than they were a few months ago and hospitals are now better equipped to treat them, he added.Emmanuel Macron, the president, has ruled out another national lockdown, saying the country could not afford it.France has reported more than 30,000 coronavirus deaths, Europe’s third-highest toll after the UK and Italy.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/03/12/hong-kong-election-masks.jpg","title":"coronavirus reinfected hong kong covid 19 study","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Hong Kong man experienced a second infection of Covid-19 just four months after recovering from earlier sicknessThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have reported the world’s first case of a human being reinfected with coronavirus in a discovery that could have significant implications for the development of vaccines and hopes of natural immunity against the virus.Researchers at Hong Kong University’s department of microbiology said genetic sequencing of the virus showed a Hong Kong man was infected twice by different versions of the Covid-19 virus months apart.According to the study paper, the patient was a 33-year-old man who was in good health. When he was first infected he suffered a cough, sore throat, fever and headache for three days. He had a test that confirmed Covid-19 and he was hospitalised on March 29.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe was discharged on 14 April after two negative swab tests.Four and a half months later he was returning to Hong Kong from Spain via the UK when he tested positive during entry screening at Hong King airport on 15 August. He was hospitalised again but had no symptoms throughout.Experts cautioned against jumping to conclusions based on one single case but acknowledged the discovery was a concern.Announcing the results, the Hong Kong University said: “An apparently young and healthy patient had a second episode of Covid-19 infection which was diagnosed 4.5 months after the first episode.This case illustrates that reinfection can occur just after a few months of recovery from the first infection. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“Since the immunity can be short lasting after natural infection, vaccination should also be considered for those with one episode of infection.“Patients with previous Covid-19 infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing.”If the research, published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, is correct then it could mean vaccines against the virus may not give permanent protection and people may not be able to rely on being immune to the virus after recovering from an infection.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDr David Strain, from the University of Exeter said: “This is a worrying finding for several reasons. The first, as is laid out in this manuscript, is that it suggests that previous infection is not protective. The second is that it raises the possibility that vaccinations may not provide the hope that we have been waiting for.“Vaccinations work by simulating infection to the body, thereby allowing the body to develop antibodies. If antibodies don\u0027t provide lasting protection, we will need to revert to a strategy of viral near-elimination in order to return to a more normal life.”There have already been a number of reports of patients being reinfected with the virus but this was based on clinical features of the disease. In this case scientists used genetic sequencing to analyse the separate strains of the virus.Dr Jeffrey Barrett, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, urged caution over the news arguing it was hard to draw conclusions until the full research study had been published.He said: “This is certainly stronger evidence of reinfection than some of the previous reports because it uses the genome sequence of the virus to separate the two infections. It seems much more likely that this patient has two distinct infections than a single infection followed by a relapse.“An important point about this one case, which is not mentioned in the press release, is that the second infection is asymptomatic. It was caught by screening tests on returning passengers at HK airport, and the inidual never developed any symptoms from their second infection.”He said given the number of global infections so far, one case of reinfection was not surprising and he warned the research “implications” were too broad given it was based on one case.“This may be very rare, and it may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious (though we don’t know whether this person was infectious during their second episode).”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, added: “The significant thing here is that being reinfected with a mutated strain demonstrates that it is more likely to be reinfection, rather than the same infection that has hung around because the virus has not actually been got rid of, as some people have suggested happens.“The finding of a mutant strain is absolutely nothing to be shocked or surprised by, it would actually be more interesting if there were no mutations cropping up.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some things are good and some are bad.FactCheck Twitter feed“I’d like to think the UK is not as bad as in other countries – the US is leading the way with that very muddy space.”In separate research, the fact-checking organisation First Draft found that Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats all published misleading advertising during the campaign.But the Tories were “by far the most frequent”, with 88 per cent of their most shared online adverts between 1 and 4 December containing misleading information, compared to 6.7 per cent for Labour.King’s College researchers said it was “difficult to calculate” whether the efforts had an impact on the election result, which saw Boris Johnson returned as prime minister with a majority increased by 47 seats.Tories set up fake fact-checking service for election debateThey warned that the coronavirus pandemic could operate as a measure of public trust in the governing party, adding: “On a daily basis, the government is trying to persuade British citizens that its reported death tolls are accurate.“It wants citizens to believe the message that it is ‘succeeding’ in controlling the epidemic, despite its recent electoral record of using disinformation tactics and admitting it unapologetically.”A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said it rejected what it called “wild assertions”.“All Conservative Party advertising was labelled, following best practice on digital imprints,” he added.“We are delivering on the promises the British public elected us on, getting Brexit done, investing in our public services and levelling-up across the country.“The research classed disinformation as a deliberate lie or misrepresentation, while misinformation can be created or spread accidentally.Dr Granelli said there was a perception that disinformation was “happening at a more industrial rate than has ever happened before” amid a global rise in online communications.Conservatives post misleading edited campaign video of Labour ministerBut she warned that it was hard to measure the impact on voting behaviour because the reasons for people’s decisions, or behind the views they form, were not fully known.Dr Granelli noted that the period since the 2016 EU referendum, which has seen two general elections, two Conservative and two Labour leadership elections, has meant party-political campaigning “continuing for a lot longer than it normally would”.The report called for more research to be done across multiple platforms to examine how false information spreads and takes root, calling claims that “Facebook, or bots, or the Russians are the core threat” a “misdiagnosis” of the problem.“A lot of the time, people are looking for information that reinforces their beliefs,” Dr Granelli said.“It might be their friends, parents, newspapers, celebrities or musicians.“It’s almost a perfect storm – the old gatekeepers have been removed and we haven’t found the right way to replace them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Four of the world’s seven vaccines that are in the third phase of trials are from China. Two of the candidates are from China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a unit of state-owned pharmaceutical giant China National Pharmaceutical Group.Sinovac Biotech is developing the third candidate called CoronaVac, while CanSino Biologics is working with state military research unit Academy of Military Medical Sciences on Ad5-nCoV.Before the official launch of the “emergency use” programme in July, China’s military approved the use of CanSino’s vaccine in June.State media also reported in June that employees at state-owned firms travelling overseas were allowed to take one of two candidate vaccines.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And lockdowns cause deaths.”Government scientists have warned that another national shutdown could cases spike.Many nations in Europe - such as France and Spain - are seeing a rise in cases. Some towns and cities are also facing the threat of local lockdowns, such as Birmingham - which has seen  cases in the last week.Professor Clancy, who is also the former leader of Birmingham City Council, warned current testing numbers are low and unreliable.He said: The reality is that increased and more widespread testing is leading, oddly enough, to finding more cases. This has not broadly led to increases in Covid- related deaths and hospital admissions in other so-called hotspots.Birmingham has been placed on the national watch list by Health Secretary Matt Hancock after a rise in cases.Police have been cracking down on enforcing social distancing, and said last night they were called to more than  street and house parties.However, Professor Clancy said the government data shows  of Birminghams  neighbourhoods did not record a single positive case of coronavirus last week.He also pointed out the apparent  per cent jump in the number of casesper , over the past two weeks is actually just an increase of six people. The expert said: These are micro-numbers, and talking about them in terms of spikes just won’t do. It is certainly not enough to spark policy change.He warned local officials risk over-reacting to apparent spikes.And he said the decisions should be taken by national government as city politicians do not have a signicant enough democratic mandate.   Professor Clancy explained he backed hyper-local intervention to try and beat the coronavirus.And he added officials should only be alarmedthere is a spike in deaths, saying theyare sadly the most reliable figure during the pandemic.Britain recorded six deaths today, while England recorded a new low of one.He said: What you can’t have is local lockdown panic without a wider context. Otherwise you’ll get ridiculous decisions to lockdown completely unrelated to the actual risk.Hyper-local intervention in very local areas of concern is a much better future option. Shutting down regions and cities will be ineffective, and has already been seen to be so.He added: Until we get our testing, and track and tracing system, into proper, reliable shape we should not be basing policy on it.Fears have surfaced of second nationwide coronavirus lockdown as officials warned the end of the year will be bumpy for Britain.The Sage advisory group said Britain’s reproduction number was between . and ., with senior sources warning “more nationwide measures” may be needed. A senior government source told The : We’re looking at a pretty bumpy autumn and winter and that’s going to go in the direction of increased cases and increased outbreaks.Another source added: “If it doesn’t get contained it may be that some things that have been open, you need to think about whether measures need to be taken to reverse things.Government scientists fear Britain could follow countries like Spain, Europe’s fastest rising caseload, with  cases per , people. The number of daily cases in the holiday hotspot have risen from  when lockdown eased on June  to more than ,.National figures showed that one person died from coronavirus today in England, as the UK confirmed , new cases.Emergency plans have been drawn up to protect the UK from the perfect storm of a winter second wave of Covid- coinciding with a No Deal Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Strict rules do not work as people seem to break them.The Scandinavian country recorded  new cases on Friday and  on Saturday.Stefan Lofven, the prime minister, insisted on Friday their response to the pandemic was right.He told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter: The strategy that we adopted, I believe is right - to protect iniduals, limit the spread of the infection.What has been discussed most, and what we did dferently in Sweden, was that we did not close schools. Now there are quite a few people who think we were right.From the beginning in the global outbreak, Sweden introduced voluntary social-distancing rules, home-working and recommendations for people to avoid public transport.The compulsory measures that were brought in included a ban on gatherings of more than  people, restrictions on visiting care homes, and table-only service in bars and restaurants.However, the decision to not lockdown has come with consequences.A total of , Swedes have died of Covid- - signicantly higher than its neighbours Norway,Denmark and Finland.Anders Tegnell, the top epidemiologist leading the response to Swedens pandemic, claimed the infection rates of Spain, Belgium and France have increased after mask mandates in public spaces came in.

Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in.Earlier this month, the BBC pointed out that Swedens antibody rate is fairly similar to the UKs.The broadcaster said it compared with  per cent of Londoners found with coronavirus antibodies when tested in April and May, and five-to-ten per cent of people living in Geneva.Sweden has faced sharp criticism for the governments decision to not lockdown.

Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: The union leaders that Iaposm talking to all the time are as desperate as anyone to see children back in class. Theyaposre education professionals, theyaposre teachers, they really care as much as anybody about childrenaposs futures and it isnapost the responsibility of the trade unions ultimately to get children into the classroom. The Government has to make the conditions suitable and safe for schools, for staff, for students and itaposs been asleep at the wheel, itaposs been not paying the attention that schools need to the details of how they are going to reopen, nor has it been out sending a strong and clear message to parents. She added: “Itaposs essential children go back to schoolfor... their wellbeing, their learning and their long-term le opportunities. But really in terms of making preparations for their , while headteachers, principals and school staff have been working really hard over the last few weeks of the summer holidays to make the schools safe, I think the Government has been missing in action.” NAHT union general secretary Paul Whiteman urged ministers to engage with families to help pupils . He said: The Governmentaposs back-to-school campaign has really got to engage with parents, let parents know what to do, and to make sure that parents know what to do around the school as well to make sure all of the measures being taken in school are as secure as they can be. It came as Dr Jenny Harries, Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer,  said that the risk for teachers in schools is probably highest between staff. Dr Harries also said it would be unlikely that there would be a scenario where all schools across the country would be forced to close again. But in areas subject to a local lockdown there could be inidual schools forced to close. She said that no environment is risk free but added that the risk to children was higher from seasonal flu compared to the current risks posed by Covid-. And she said that a single case in a school bubble may not lead to the whole bubble being forced into isolation. The comments come after the UKaposs chief medical officers issued a joint statement seeking to reassure parents that it was safe to send their children back to school.  Dr Harries told Sky News: We think itaposs vitally important that school stay open but obviously when itaposs safe to do so. There will be rare occurrences where we may recommend that a school closes, and that will be relatedcommunity transmission rates, rather than necessarily from the school itself. We think that transmission risks within the school are low, as long as the measures that have been recommended are put in place. But where you get rising transmission rates... then obviously we may make an inidual recommendation for a school but increasingly that will be very localised. Itaposs very unlikely that we would see all schools closing down at one go. She added: So weaposre not saying it, no environment is completely risk-free. Every time the parents send their child off to school pre-Covid they may have been involved in a road traffic accident, there are all sorts of things. And in fact that risk or the risk from seasonal flu, we think is probably higher than the current risks of Covid. On coronavirus transmission rates, she said that community transmission risk is far more important than schools. Dr Harries added: The transmission from younger children - when teachers are perhaps more likely to be closer to them - is much lower. Actually in the studies that have been done so far, the risk probably of transmission between staff, rather than to or from children, is the one that teachers perhaps should be focusing on - so itaposs going off for a coffee break, you know, dropping your guard down. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she added that the majority of cases in schools were from staff-to-staff interactions. She added: I think itaposs really important to reassure teachers on that count, but also to encourage them. When itaposs their coffee break and they get a well-earned rest in the day, to ensure that they maintain their social distancing, good hand-hygiene, all those sorts of things while they have their break because that does seem to be a risk factor. When askedone case was detected in a school bubble she replied: These systems are set up very much that as soon as an inidual cases detected - as long as thataposs reported through Test and Trace and through Public Health England - contact tracing will go on.

Mr Harrison instructed them that all children will be required to wear surgical masks when being dropped off and picked up from school.

These rules will be applied to all pupils from Year  upwards, when pupilsto the school - which holds an aposOutstandingapos rating from Ofsted - on September . The decision was taken after the headteacher says nearly a third of parents had threatened to keep kids away.  Mr Harrison revealed that another factor was that five members of staff resigned at the start of summer citing Covid- as the reason. He also told how over a quarter of staff at the school were found to have underlying health issues. This means that these staff members - who made up % of school faculty - could not go into the school to teach children of key workers early on in lockdown. Mr Harrison said today that he hopes the schoolaposs safety measures will encourage all pupils and staff to- for the sake of their mental and social wellbeing.  He said: The school has now spent £, on preventative equipment for pupils. These includes PPE and thermal scanners, as well as everything they will need in classrooms throughout the day - face visors, water bottles, pencil cases. Nothing will need to be brought into school with them, and nothing will be taken home. It is all provided in classrooms. Thataposs a hell of an expenditure on our part - but itaposs all about minimising risk. What is the problem with putting in an added layer of protection  You wouldnapost put your child on a bicycle without putting a helmet on their head. And itaposs also about making sure the staff with underlying health issues feel comfortable coming back in to school. Teachers will be wearing face visors in classrooms, too. Iaposm hoping that all the staff will come back in. We know the importance of getting kids back into school.

For your own safety as well as ours, please try and keep your distance. “. WE ARE STILL HUMAN. This brings me to my main point. I have come home from what was a reasonably short and supposedly easy sht today feeling totally defeated and lost for words. We cannot control Covid. I am not the creator of the rules so please don’t belittle me and call me stupid, idiotic or a b*tch just because you have to book a slot for the swimming pool or need to wear a mask for a mere  minutes in the shop. You wouldn’t like itI responded to you in the same way.  “. Lastly, ENJOY YOUR STAY! Be grateful that in these times you have been lucky enough to travel and have a slight sense of normality in booking a holiday. For many people this is something they could only have wished for. We love having you here and are grateful that you are keeping our economy up and running and we thank you for it. “BUT PLEASE.

I pray that their behaviour does not harm the loveliest county and itaposs equally lovely people. “As someone who works in the NHS it broke my heart. Stay safe everyone.” Beth told Cornwall Live: “We had to close the pool yesterday for a safety reason and people were saying we’d ruined their holiday, taken their fun away from them and weren’t making enough effort. “I’ve worked at the holiday park for the past couple of summers – you get the odd complaint but it’s never been like this. It’s like they’ve come on holiday for a break and everything’s okay down here – but it’s not. I’m trying to keep my cool with them….” She added: “Yesterday I had four people be rude to me. I had to cry in the staff room because it was so nasty.” It was when she ed home from that sht that she took to Facebook.

Not the PM’s cynical lying, not the arrogance and not the laziness – though these are all per­­ilous traits reinforcing his unsuitability for high office – but the grotesque ineptitude of a harmfully useless charlatan. This is the chancer who flies by the seat of his privileged pants, who demonstrated a frightening lack of concern for the aspirations of millions of children over testing. People who, foolishly, cut Johnson a bit of slack over sky-high virus death tolls and dire financial damage aren’t giving him the benefit of the doubt over the entirely avoidable BTEC, GCSE and A-level shambles. It’s why Starmer is now preferred to Johnson as PM in polls and, nine months after an election drubbing, the Labour Party has inched to within a couple of points of the Conservatives.One-time chief prosecutor Starmer is widely viewed as competent, while ex-magazine editor Johnson is seen as incompetent.Starmer successfully ran the hugely complex Crown Prosecution Service.Johnson was forced to apologise for mistakes at the Spectator, once dubbed The Sextator. Just as voters cared about the Back to Basics tawdry hypocrisy during John Major’s tortuous long goodbye in the s, Starmer is betting on people becoming fed up with Johnson’s stumbling in the s. The PM who gted a free pass to rule-breaker Dominic Cummings, promoted a crony behind a test-and-trace system reaching only half of contacts and is overseeing a regime stained by corruption allegations isn’t going to wake up any morning soon as a newly able leader.

Doug, a -month-old pug, miraculously survived the ordeal without the need for surgery although the large needle became lodged in his stomach. His owner Sonia Wheeler, , had been sewing at her dining room table in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, when the needle fell onto the floor. Doug swallowed it whole, along with a small thread during lockdown. The pug was dashed to animal hospital Wear Referrals, in Bradbury, County Durham, where X-rays showed the metal had become stuck in his stomach and he needed emergency treatment.  Sonia, who is a hairdresser, today told : I was sewing at my dining room table when the needle dropped to the floor - Doug darted straight to the needle and picked it up in his mouth. Panic ran through me as he’s a typical puppy who swallows anything you attempt to take from him but it was gone before I knew it. Doug was not phased and was his usual bouncy, playful and ever-so-charming self, as though he’d done nothing wrong.  The opportunity for him to have the needle removed without having surgery was fantastic to hear. Vets safely removed the needle and thread without any surgery and Doug has since made a full recovery. Heaposs now back home with his owners. Doug has recovered remarkably well and is back to his cheeky little self, with a love of cuddles, sunshine and the outdoors, Sonia added.  Chiara Giannasi, internal medicine clinician at Wear Referrals, led Doug’s treatment and carried out an endoscopy to remove the offending object.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

The Queen and Prince Philip will spend the next few months at their ,-acre Scottish estate and their relatives and in-laws will come and stay at dferent points.According to her granddaughter Princess Eugenie, the stunning castle is where the Monarch is the most happy, and she loves spending time with her children and their familes. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their kids George, Charlotte and Louis, Prince Charles, Camilla, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and the York sisters all pop in to stay with the Queen and Philip during their holidays - making it a very busy time for them.But what exactly do the royals get up to during their Scottish break  Due to social distancing, relatives will stay at separate accommodation rather than sleeping in the Castle itself. However the majority of their normal holiday activities take place outdoors anyway, so they wonapost have to make many changes to ensure everyone is safe. Speaking on ITVaposs documentary Our Queen at , Eugenie, who was spotted arriving at the Castle last week, talked about previous trips to Balmoral.  She said: Itaposs the most beautul place on earth. I think Granny is the most happy there, I think she really, really loves the Highlands…walks, picnics, dogs, a lot of dogs, thereaposs always dogs, and people coming in and out all the time. Family-wise weaposre all there, so itaposs a lovely base for Granny and Grandpa to be - for us to come and see them up there where you just have room to breathe and run. But according to an insider, itaposs not almost the most relaxing break and things can be pretty hectic.  They told Vanity Fair: “It can get quite busy at what they call ‘the big house’ and it’s not especially relaxing even though it’s a holiday. “There’s a daily routine which evolves around meal times, several outfit changes every day, sometimes five, and the Queen likes everything to run like clockwork. The focus is on being outdoors and in the countryside walking, grousing, fishing and hunting.” Balmoral is a working estate with highlights including grouse moors, the lush green forests and farmland, as well as plenty of animals from the herds of deer to Highland cattle and ponies.  The Royals love grouse hunting, and go out regularly during their time at the castle. Prince Charles, William, Harry and Kate have all been known to go out shooting over the summer months, and last year they even took little George along to watch.However, they were forced to call off the whole grouse shooting season last year as there was a drop in the number of the birds in the area due to insects and bad  weather. Photographer Milton Gendel said he was invited to Balmoral back in  , and opened up about the experience to  Vanity Fair  .He wrote: On some days there were excursions into the country. The Queen had been taught to drive by auxiliary army officers during World War II, and she handled a Land Rover with intrepid skill on the hilly and winding roads. When we went riding, she saddled her horse, and afterward carried the saddle back to the stable herself.  At a shoot on the grounds a truck delivered a sumptuous buffet lunch. The aposgunsapos lay on the grass for a postprandial respite. The Queen and her sister walked about, deep in conversation. They were very close when apart, they telephoned two or three times a day. The atmosphere was always agreeable, buoyed by the light touch of the Queen and her sister.

Industry chiefs fear , jobs are at riskthe nighttime sector is forced to stay closed. Now the Night Time Industries Association says afor clubs and venues is possible as the sector reaches a critical point. It warns % of businesses could permanently close by next monthsomething isnapost done. Now proposals by the Institute of Occupational Medicine for the nightclub industry says bouncers would patrol the inside of venues and make sure people are staying apart. Temperature checks will be done at the doors, customers would have to give their details for track-and-trace and face masks would have to be worn. The report states: “Use of face coverings on the dancefloor can be implemented and enforced through existing security staff and protocols.” The association said the night-time economy was one of the few remaining sectors without any clear path to reopening and has urged the Government to save the sector from collapse. The report said there is a strong argument to permit clubs to reopen under strict controls bearing in mind the behaviour we are witnessing in unregulated environments such as beaches, parks and raves.  It added: Whilst there are some areas of increased risks over other sectors there are many real benefits that such businesses have over other sectors, particularly as all our venues have security to give % cover of matters such as temperature checks, track and trace, and keeping customer behaviour in check. There are also sector specic measures which venues can put in place which would put them at least on a par with other businesses which are allowed to open. Michael Kill, chief executive of the association, said: We have now reached a critical point. In the absence of a clear reopening strategy from government, or the promise of financial support, huge numbers of businesses within our industry are facing financial collapse and thousands of job losses.

She describes herself as a Plain Jane and says she was a geek, but in the years since sheaposs undergone a complete transformation, both mentally and physically, and is much happier for it. In fact, Roxy is now so dferent that she claims many of her old classmates donapost recognise her when she runs into them in her home city Cardf. At , sheaposs now a bikini model and has recently retrained as a personal trainer, and is proud of the outgoing adult sheaposs become. She said: “You wouldn’t recognise me physically and mentallyyou knew me when I was at school - a lot of people don’t. “I was really skinny growing up - my legs were just as thick as my arms. Now I’ve got an athletic figure and I’m a completely dferent person. I was painfully shy as a child. I was a geek and academic and didn’t get into trouble. “I had a bit of acne and never wore makeup because my dad didn’t like it - so I wasn’t really able to explore it. I was a bit of a plain Jane.  “Things changed when I went to sixth form and I was put with people I didn’t know. I was forced to talk and thrown in the deep end. “When I was  I bought a self-help book and that really started to build my confidence. “That and more le experience have made me a dferent person. It has been a gradual process but wearing makeup and glamming myself did help.  “If you feel confident on the inside, you feel confident on the outside. After finishing school Roxy studied health nutrition at university and got a number of office jobs. But her confidence started to grow when she began lting weights about four years ago and saw how her body was changing. Teaching herself with YouTube videos and books she quickly turned her skinny physique into a sleek athletic one which motivated her further to start wearing makeup and doing her hair. She went on to enter bikini competitions before qualying as a personal trainer three years ago - something she initially did part-time. But since being furloughed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Roxy has now dedicated all of her time to her passion and is hoping to turn it into a full-time career.This involves her confidently speaking to strangers - something she’d never have done as a teenager. And the transformation has given her a more lucrative career, as well as a new lease of le.  She said: “I make more money per hour doing personal training. My office job was £ an hour but personal training is around £ an hour so there’s potential to make a lot more money. “Before lockdown I was working  hours a week. I worked from .am until pm so I could only train people before or after work or on the weekend.

According to a tracker by John Hopkins University, there have been ,, Covid- cases globally and the killer virus has claimed , lives to date. More than  million people have recovered. But there are  nations where their government claim they have managed to remain coronavirus-free. Some authorities are unlikely to admitthey have an outbreak while countries that are remote islands are able to evade the virus by refusing to let outsiders in, the Business Insider reports. The Cook Islands The South Pacic island is self-ruling but is in free association with New Zealand so closed its borders to the country when it saw a spike in cases. Last week week its former prime minister Joseph Williams was hospitalised with coronavirus but he is in New Zealand Prime Minister Henry Puna said: We are taking very serious measures in order to protect our people and to control and keep this deadly disease away from our shores.  Federated States of Micronesia The Pacic Ocean island country is made up of more than  islands and has a population of ,. It closed its borders and formed a task force which has rehearsed what the nation would dothere were any cases. Citizens of Federated States of Micronesia that have ed to the island from abroad must quarantine. Kiribati The Pacic Island nation has a population of more than ,. People wishing to enter Kiribati from a country with an ongoing transmission of the virus must spend  days in a coronavirus-free country. They must also produce medical evidence they have tested negative for the virus on entry to Kiribati. The Marshall Islands The Pacic Ocean island has almost , people and comprises of , inidual islands and islets. Its official name is officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands and it has closed its borders to all international travellers. Domestic flights between Majuro, the islands capital, and Kwajalein, the southernmost part of the country have also been cancelled.  Nauru Nauru is a Pacic Ocean island country of more than , people. Itaposs the worldaposs smallest island nation measuring just eight square miles. Its government has expressed concerns about the growing number of coronavirus cases in surrounding countries including Australia and New Zealand.  Niue Niue is one of the worldaposs smallest countries with a population of less than , people. The South Pacic Ocean island country has close links to New Zealand. It lies between Tonga and the Cook Islands.  North Korea The countryaposs dictator Kim Jong-un has denied any confirmed cases but has repeatedly warned the virus is a threat. It already has little contact and travel with the rest of the world but it closed it borders further in January, and recently quarantined a border town after a defector entered from South Korea. Experts are sceptical about its claims of no cases and believe the country may have had an outbreak in March or even earlier.  Palau The Pacic Ocean country is an archipelago of more than  islands and around , people. Its health ministry has issued guidelines on how citizens can protect themselves from contracting the virus and all travellers must quarantine on entry. It said: While we do not want people to panic, we need to be vigilant and cautious, and to practise current recommended preventive measures, including frequent handwashing, practicing respiratory etiquettes, social distancing, and preparing aswe are going to get that first confirmed case.

The government is currently drawing up plans on how it can allow tourists back without bringing the virus into the country.

Since March, Tonga has quarantined people, implemented a curfew, banned large groups and contact sports, and urged social distancing in case the virus had entered the country. It also closed its borders to flights and cruise ships.  Turkmenistan The dictatorship claims it is coronavirus-free but experts say Turkmenistan is one of the most repressive and secretive countries in the world. The island, which gained independence the Soviet Union in , already claims it has no citizens with HIV Aids, which experts say is not possible. But Turkmenistan is already one of the hardest countries in the world to enter and at the beginning of the outbreak it made things tougher which may have helped it avoid any cases. Tuvalu Another Polynesian island country it has a population of just ,. Its official tourism website describes the country as one of the smallest and most remote nations in the world. Tuvalu also boasts a vast expanse of ocean interspersed with atolls, magnicent lagoons, coral reefs and small island.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The vehicle was in the Premier Inn car park and given his presentation and the smell of alcohol, they were under the impression that he was under the influence.”Ovenstone was taken to police headquarters just before am where he refused to provide two specimens of breath.He stated: “If you hadn’t treated me like crap I wouldn’t be so disrespectful.”Appearing from custody, Ovenstone pleaded guilty to breaching his curfew by being out with his home after pm and before am and refusing to provide the specimens of breath.Defence solicitor Paul Parker-Smith said Ovenstone and his cousin had been drinking the previous evening when they became “hungry”.Mr Parker-Smith said: “It seemed to have gone well in the sense that he was served.“He realised he may have been over the limit and took the foolish decision to refuse a specimen of breath.”Sherf George Way deferred sentence on Ovenstone for reports to be prepared and disqualied him from driving on an interim basis.

Wait ages for one and suddenly three turn up at once.The three were also available for yesterday#s home victory against Livingston.Just  hours after completing a loan move from Bristol City, attacker Marley Watkins was thrown in at the deep end leading the line.Striker Bruce Anderson, unavailable for the Perth clash, was also back.Then there was a further boost just minutes before kick-off, with Curtis Main added to the squad when Craig Bryson felt his calf in the warm-up.Main had been out since knee surgery in the summer and also suffered a thigh strain during his rehabilitation.His appearance off the bench against Liv surely gives McInnes the option of going with two up top against NSI Runavik.New signing Marley Watkins was thrown straight into the action at Pittodrie just  hours after completing his loan move from Bristol City.Welsh international Watkins # who can also be played out wide # has had just  minutes of action since January, but he looked sharp and fast while leading the attack.On the basis of this debut, he can deliver goals and assists for Aberdeen. He was only denied a debut goal yesterday because of a brilliant double block from Livi keeper Robbie McCrorie.The stopper is the twin brother of Reds midfielder-defender Ross McCrorie.Aberdeen’s last appearance at Pittodrie was initially a cause for celebration as football ed to the stadium for the first time in more than five months due to the Covid- pandemic.It quickly turned sour with a turgid performance in a - loss to Rangers followed by the actions of the Aberdeen eight in attending a busy city centre bar on the night of that defeat.That plunged the Reds’ season into early chaos, but with two straight wins # away at St Johnstone and at home against Livi # they are getting it back on track, although there could be a further setback with the SFA serving notices of complaint to the eight players.They could be hit with bans of between two to eight games at Friday’s principle hearing.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Signicant proposed changes include enabling the children involved to express their views and changing the way these views are obtained.But unless an amendment from Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur is agreed in tomorrows debate, a key opportunity will be missed to improve the chances that children will remain equally involved with both of their parents. The vast majority of research around the world concludes that equal time or close to it has enduring benefits for the children in separated families.Mr McArthurrsquos amendment introduces a factor into court hearings that has already been successful in other progressive countries. On the request of one of the parents, the sherf hearing a court case will have to consider whether children should spend approximately equal time with each of their parents.The amendment doesnrsquot force the court to order shared care. It doesnrsquot bind the hands of a sherf or undermine the overweening principle that the sherf will put the interests of the children first. It does mean thatthere are two safe, competent, loving parents both will have the opportunity to make their case for sharing the parenting responsibilities. It creates a dferent starting point for the decision from the winner-takes-all competition we currently have in Scotland.A similar law has been in force in Belgium since . It has reduced the number of such disputes that have to be brought to court. According to Belgian family judge Marie-France Carlier, ldquothere has been a huge reduction of parental conflict in the courts as parents now know what the law says. After separation, lots of them immediately decide to set up joint physical custody before having any court decision. A change in culture has gone hand in hand with a change in the law.Only about  per cent of Belgian decisions are for a : split with around % of remaining decisions for semi-equal care, with the children spending at least five days per fortnight with one parent.Usually it is the father who ends up with less time, but this still means he can be fully involved in weekday care ndash not relegated to the visiting role of a ldquoweekend dad. If the court considers that children will not benefit from full involvement of both parents it can order whatever contact pattern is best for them.Underpinning Mr McArthurrsquos amendment is an acceptance that the current system is expensive, unpredictable and inconsistent between courts and between sherfs. It has too many disincentives to cooperation between parents at a time when they need help to make things as easy as possible for their children, not a system that encourages them to criticise each other to win time with their kids.We have heard sherfs say from the bench ndash even before hearing arguments ndash that shared parenting never works. Of course sherfs also know they never see the successes. Only the failures come back before them.Politicians in countries such as Portugal, Greece and Brazil are currently considering whether to make similar changes in their family law. Holyrood could strike a blow for parental equality this week and bring the law into line with the reality of family le in modern Scotland.Ian Maxwell is the national manager of the Shared Parenting Scotland charity"},{"url":null,"title":"workers-sec-lose-jobs-furlough-scheme-winds","story":"In an e-mail sent to staff and shared with the The Herald, Levy Restaurants - the company which employs hospitality staff at the venue- toldworkers their last furlough payment would be made on September .Valentina Severa Clavell, a worker at Finnieston-basedvenuesaid they had received \"barely any communication and support\".:Scottish Government told to stop savage job cuts at Donald Trumps Turnberry resortWorkers were told that due to the fact live events were not able to continue because ofongoing restrictions, the company would not continue their employment.A Unite hospitality spokesman confirmed the news: \"The way in which Levy Restaurants have treated their staff at Scottish Events Campus is nothing short of disgraceful.There is an alternative to mass redundancy available till at least October  in the Job Retention Scheme.

Given the President is running for a second time, some iation on a theme would be permissible.The Republican convention, like the Democratsrsquo gathering, will be like nothing seen before.

Gone was the sales conference meets Christmas party atmosphere of old, complete with pop music and balloons. Even the firework display looked asit was trying hard to be modest.A stellar line up of speakers, led by Michelle Obama, and slick production , still made it a television event that more than  million Americans watched each night. Joe Bidenrsquos speech was well received, evenhe did not receive a big bump in the polls, and another  million was added to the partyrsquos coffers. Job done, everyone happy.Will the Republicans be saying the same come Thursday night  Whatever happens, the event is not the one the party wanted. Organisers tried to get as close to the convention norm as possible, but that plan was scrapped as the death toll from Covid- continued to soar.Instead, there will be a mix of in-person events, with an audience in Washington of no more than  people, and speeches from the key players at ious locations.On Thursday the President will accept the nomination at the White House, defying critics who say the residence should not be used for party political purposes. The First Lady, Melania Trump, will take to the podium in the White House rose garden tomorrow, hoping to follow the success of Jill Biden, who filmed a video in the school in which she once taught.Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to Mr Trump, has promised a move away from what she called the ldquodour and sour mood of the Democratic National Convention.

Not given to delivering tightly scripted addresses, the President could find himself wandering far off topic. Any over-running will not go down well with television networks and viewers waiting for their shows to start.What a change it will be for a candidate who is at his happiest when he is speaking to his base in some vast auditorium.

As with the Democrats, the partyrsquos general direction of travel will be apparent. The Democrats went for the centre ground, going heavy on the personal ndash Mr Bidenrsquos steadiness, decency, inclusiveness ndash and light on policy. It was the most positive campaign launch since Barack Obamarsquos  run.It would be the mother and father of all convention surprisesthe Republicans followed suit. Mr Trump has been trying out ious lines for size, accusing Mr Biden and his Veep nominee Kamala Harris of being prisoners of the left. A heavy emphasis on law and order and protecting the suburbs is expected. But how personal can he be in attacking his opponents  This is not  when he questioned the integrity of Hillary Clinton, and encouraged his supporters to do the same. Voters may accept that from a candidate, but not a President.Perhaps the best the Republicans can expect from their unconventional convention is to get through it without any major gaffes. They can then start campaigning proper where it matters, on the ground. With most voters not turning their attention to the election until a couple of weeks before polling day, the conventions had already lost much of their impact.

A comprehensive revaluation should be set in hand which would give the basis both for a fairer property tax and for a land value tax, both to be introduced within five years. Local authorities should also be permitted a wider range of local taxes, which could include a tourist tax and workplace parking levies. Community councils should be enabled as of right to levy a small precept on the council tax instead of being dependent on local authority handouts. The balance of council income would come from the Scottish Government, which controls income tax levels, and would be at a iable level so that richer areas would receive less per head of population than poorer areas.This approach, primarily taxing land, property and income, would mean that Scotland could have a fairer and more progressive taxation system even within the constraints laid down by Westminster.David Mumford, Dunbar.NOT SO GREENYOU report on SSE Renewable`s new Viking wind farm near Shetland. As usual, there will be little use of Scottish labour and the turbines themselves will be installed and manufactured by a foreign company, in this case Vestas from Denmark Business, August . We are, as always, advised that some work will be offered to local labour but by far, the bulk of the turbine installation and manufacture goes to other countries.Wind turbines are always being promoted as green energy, but no thought has been given to the amount of fossil fuel used in their manufacture nor transport and installation. Another major cost, overlooked on all of their promotion, is the cost of decommissioning after the  to -year lespan and the subsequent disposable of currently unrecyclable turbine blades, the bulk being taken to landfill.George Dale, Beith.GAELIC FOLLYIT seems the force feeding of Gaelic continues apace.

True, le expectancy in the UK has increased steadily for decades, though the Office for National Statistics points out that it has signicantly levelled off since .And the current pandemic has jolted us all into a new sense of urgency, with increasing numbers deciding to make a will ndash a rise accompanied by a new interest in the power of attorney, which anticipates the possibility that someone, for reasons of age or health, may have to allow another to deal with their affairs.Scott Ewart, managing partner at Glasgow-based legal services firm Thomas Bradley and Co, believes that granting power of attorney is arguably even more important than making a will.ldquoSomeone losing capacity without having appointed an attorney ndash someone who can formally act on their behalf ndash could end up in a terrible situation.ldquoPeople often assume that when they write a will and appoint an executor, that person ndash often one of their children ndash will deal with all those issues including power of attorney but thats not the case, he says.ldquoWe can advise them about the dference between a will, which takes care of your affairs after you have passed away and a power of attorney that ensures your affairs are taken care of should you lose the capacity to manage them yourself.There are two types of power of attorney in Scotland: that relating to financial property affairs which you can decide to begin immediately or onlyyou become incapable and welfare power of attorney, which allows someone to make welfare decisions for you should you lose the capacity to make these decisions.Incapacity, Ewart points out, can affect the simplest aspects of le. ldquoPeople tend to think in terms of a crisis, such as someone being affected by Alzheimerrsquos, but power of attorney can be important for someone who is just struggling physically, he says.ldquoI think of my grandmother who at  is mentally as sharp as a tack but set up a power of attorney as through illness she simply wasnrsquot able get out to take care of basic essentials such as going to the post office for her pension. Someone may also need their son or daughter to make sure gas or electricity bills are looked after and that the shopping is done.Which means that the person granted powers of attorney must be someone you can trust implicitly ndash and someone who also feels comfortable with acting formally on anotherrsquos behalf. Some people find it dficult to discuss with a parent that they face losing capacity through an illness.\"So the right person isnrsquot just someone you trust but someone who can also handle the potential emotional stress of a being an attorney, he says.Appointing an attorney can be a sensitive matter but the person granted power can subsequently be altered. ldquoPeople can and do come to us after several years ndash and after circumstances have altered ndash to change the person in whom power of attorney resides or add someone , but most people tend to appoint their children or grandchildren, he says.ldquoAnd they try to share the responsibility between two or three people, making the person best able to deal with their affairs the primary attorney, with one or two substitutes.ldquoIf there are no substitutes in place and the principal attorney passes away or moves to another country after the person who has appointed them loses capacity then no one  can be appointed, he adds.The Office of the Public provides the registration service for powers of attorney and can help people who have no knowledge of whatrsquos involved. Ewart explains: ldquoTherersquos a lot of support for the many people who initially have no idea what to do and the OPG ensures that people who grant powers of attorney or put them in place are protected and that trust companies are doing their job properly.ldquoIt receives a one-off fee for that and is always there to give general advice on what you should or shouldnrsquot do, thoughlegal or financial advice is needed you should consult an appropriate adviser.And while itrsquos possible for an inidual to set up a power of attorney, Ewart says itrsquos a complicated process that involves solicitors and GPs ensuring that multiple documents are signed off correctly by the persons family members. ldquoEngaging a professional who can complete the process online removes the most onerous part of the exercise, making sure itrsquos dated, checked and signed off correctly and most importantly, that itrsquos registered, he says.The company has seen a signicant increase in requests for powers of attorney: ldquoItrsquos becoming a priority for more people and % to % of the people we talk to about wills every month now set up a power of attorney at the same time.He says that while this does not represent a major financial decision, many people are seeing their incomes squeezed at the moment so Thomas Bradley is currently halving its price for the service. ldquoWhile recognising that ndash like every other company ndash we must make money I feel we have an obligation not to have profits solely in mind at the moment and offer a service thatrsquos affordable.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

We hope we can continue to build on relationships for future projects”If you would like any more information on the work that CCP do, please don’t hesitate to call into the office on Main Street Monday to Thursday am to pm, ring   or email cullybackey@nacn.org "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301347.jpg--.jpg?1597840858000\n","title":"doc is back on the trail for annual guide dogs fund raiser","story":"Brian Doherty is gearing up for his annual ‘The Doc’s Big Walk’ in aid of Guide Dogs Northern Ireland.“Back about  years ago I said to my family ‘I’m on the waiting list for a guide dog anyway – I want to do something for other people’.

We have people looking forward to it especially with lockdown this year, people have been asking for it as an excuse to get out of the house.”This year’s walk, which begins at am in Cushendall on Sunday th August will be slightly dferent, with just  participants who must keep socially distant, and a track and trace system in place. Brian, however, is determined that it will still be a challenge for anyone who wants to get involved.“Because of restrictions we’ve had to chop the route it half – but don’t worry we’ve left the hard half for people so it’s still going to be a challenge over the hills. “We should all be in to Ballycastle about :pm.”NI Community Fundraising Relationship Manager Gary Wilson says: Over the past five years Brian has raised over pound, for Guide Dogs, and I am so thankful he and the community of St Marys GAC in Rasharkin have found a way to keep it going.Brian is excited to get going, and has been preparing for months now, with a Virtual Lap of Ireland under his belt. “My cousin and Ihave been practicing every Sunday – sometimes up to  miles and we’ve been getting help from The Training Hub Cloughmills, who can’t do enough for us. “They’ve taken us under their wing with a bit of personal training before the big walk so we can’t thank them enough.”If you would like to support Brian’s walk and the work Guide Dogs do, you can make a donation on JustGiving at  bit.ly TheDocsBigWalk "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3302507.jpg--.jpg?1597936414000\n","title":"cranswick covid cases force closure for deep clean","story":"A Cullybackey meat processing plant has been closed because of Covid- cases amongst employees.Cranswick,a pig processing plant is to shut for a deep clean and for the testing of staff.The company briefed its workers on Thursday afternoon, with the closure taking effect from : BST on Saturday.A company spokesman declined to confirm how many of its  staff were involved in the current outbreak, but said staff welfare was the primary concern.There has been a recent increase in the number of confirmed Covid- cases in Ballymena and the wider region and this has been acknowledged as a community issue.As a result of this, we can confirm that a number of colleagues at our Ballymena site have tested positive for Covid-.Working with the Public Health Authority , we have taken the decision to send all of our colleagues for testing.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

The , others include those unable to work on site or remotely, and staff on annual leave, sick leave or special leave. Most - nearly , - of these were in the Department for Communities.The Department of Finance had a £m IT budget last year.It spent an additional £m on equipping staff for home working.A spokesperson said over , laptops were purchased, along with software to support remote working including video conferencing.Mr Allister said: The number of civil servants working from home is phenomenal. I would questionit still needs to be at the level it is.With working from home on that scale, there will be costs for equipment.The point of increasing concern is the lack of urgency in getting civil servants back to the office.Mr Allister has submitted Assembly questions around civil servants# productivity while working from home.He added: In a workforce of that size, there may be some who are less eager to pull their weight outside the office.Earlier this month it emerged that Economy Minister Diane Dodds had written to the head of the Civil Service David Sterling calling for staff toto offices to boost town and city centre economies.Mrs Dodds said one of the greatest drivers of footfall in Belfast city centre would beNorthern Ireland Civil Service staff are back at work.Alison Millar, general secretary of the Nipsa trade union, said that, where possible, civil servants should work from home. She said: Not all civil servants had the ITin the initial few weeks however, over a relatively short period of time thousands of civil servants were provided with the appropriate IT to allow them to work from home.In the main the vast majority are working effectively from home using their employer-provided IT. It is not ideal. However, from a health and safety perspective Nipsa would fully support home-working given the rise in the R number, and the fact that the Executive and PHA guidance states that where you can work from home, you should continue to work from home. Home is the safest place to be at the moment.The Department of Finance said: The number of staff who can safely work within our offices has been considerably reduced to comply with social distancing, which has proven to be the most effective means of preventing the spread of the virus. Throughout this crisis, our staff have worked remotely to ensure the provision of vital services and support to a wide range of people, including those members of society and businesses impacted by Covid-. Over , laptops were purchased and associated software to support remote working including video conferencing and increased network capacity to ensure the continuation of public services including payment of benefits and other vital government services throughout the duration of the crisis. This unprecedented sht to remote working in the NICS has had the effect of enabling the workforce to be more flexible, working remotely and delivering new ways of working that has the potential in the longer term to deliver savings on office accommodation and improve productivity.

It says that actual losses to the sector here stand at £.m for the last six months alone but it warns that the figure is likely to reach double that by the end of the yearA statement says: To compound matters further, many arts organisations which rely heavily on income generated through box office, a model decimated by social distancing, are now facing a socially distanced Christmas season ahead, normally one of the most profitable times of year for the arts.The hugely popular Grand Opera House pantomime, which had been due to star May McFettridge in Goldilocks and the Three Bears, has been postponed for a year after Covid- delayed work on a massive refurbishment programme.Officials at the Millennium Forum in Derry Londonderry have also postponed their panto, Sleeping Beauty, for  months.The ACNI says it has been working closely with the Department for Communities to support arts organisation, inidual artists and freelances whose work in the creative sector has been decimated.The council says it and the Department have put together a series of emergency funding initiatives.But the ACNI warned: Short term measures now will not save the arts and entertainment infrastructure nor many of those who work within it, from artists to lighting technicians, drivers to musicians. Their work has completely disappeared and the future is uncertain.It is crucial that the arts and creative sectors are supported and sustained with further investment now and over the coming years in order to plan and deliver arts programming - programming and activities that are so important to our night time economy, to cultural tourism and to the health and wellbeing of the many iniduals most in need in our communities.The ACNI says that assistance for the arts has included: l Fty per cent of the £.m in annual core grants being paid up front to support  key arts organisations in April .l Two hundred and twenty four funding awards being made to inidual artists, totalling £,, in May June  through the Artists Emergency Programme .l The opening of the Iniduals Emergency Resilience Programmein July, worth £.m from the Department for Communities and from Future Screens NI, offering grants to iniduals working in the creative sector. l One hundred and fty funding awards being made to arts organisations, totalling £.m, through the Organisations Emergency Programme , with a second round of the programme opening soon.l The imminent opening of a capital funding programme to help arts organisations prepare for a safe reopening of venues and performance spaces.The ACNI has already said it is continuing to press government for parity of esteem in public investment in the arts here, to close the gap on spending per head of the population in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic.Last week Game of Thrones and Derry Girls star Ian McElhinney called for more government and ACNI backing for struggling actors and technicians and said he hoped funds would be directed at professionals in the industry rather than being erted to community projects.

Sinn Feacutein’s Karen Mullan has voiced her ‘disappointment and concern’ at the ‘unwillingness’ of Robin Swann to provide essential funding to keep Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Servicerunning. While the SDLP’s Mark H Durkan said like everything asked for in the North West it has become a ‘whole battle’. He described the service as a ‘huge success’ which has been a literal ‘leline’ to many. Bereaved local families, activists and organisations campaigned for a service of this kind for years. googletag.cmd.push CCIS provides a ‘safe space’ for those in crisis from pm on Thursdays until am on Sundays when many other services are not operational. It is run by Extern NI from the Holywell Building on Bishop Street. People experiencing a mental health crisis are referred to the service by the PSNI and Foyle Search  Rescue or attend of their own volition. Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While the SDLP’s Mark H Durkan said like everything asked for in the North West it has become a ‘whole battle’. He described the service as a ‘huge success’ which has been a literal ‘leline’ to many. Bereaved local families, activists and organisations campaigned for a service of this kind for years. googletag.cmd.push CCIS provides a ‘safe space’ for those in crisis from pm on Thursdays until am on Sundays when many other services are not operational. It is run by Extern NI from the Holywell Building on Bishop Street. People experiencing a mental health crisis are referred to the service by the PSNI and Foyle Search  Rescue or attend of their own volition. Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would opened in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would opened in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students.

After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

Emmet Bradley edged Glen ahead, but they lost Conor Convery to a black card after  minutes.

Education Minister Peter Weir yesterday announced a u-turn on results, with all pupils now to be given the higher of the grades submitted by their centre or the grade calculated by CCEA Over a third of all AS and A grades given to students by teachers had been originally downgraded by CCEAs standardisation system last week in a move which drew critcisim from schools, parents and pupils. One County Derry school saw  percent of its results downgraded. Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.” Related: COMMENT: Belated U-turn should have come last week  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level.

Yet for all the hoopla underpinning Sinn Fein’s our-day-will-come project their so-called ‘inevitable’ unity cannot be taken for granted. Likewise, Micheál Martin’s ‘beefed-up’ Shared Island Unit may have irked unionism a couple of weeks ago, but even he would admit that there is nothing inevitable about a united Ireland. But regular readers will know that I’m a be-ready-for-all-outcomes-and-possibilities kind of guy. I’ve said many, many times that I’m an unambiguous, unapologetic unionist and I can conceive of no circumstance in which I would swap my citizenship of the United Kingdom for citizenship of a united Ireland. That said, I’m not afraid of a debate on the subject and I have no objection to any party which wants to make the case for unity by entirely democratic means. I’m aware there are unionists who believe taking part in the debate risks conveying the impression you think unity has become a serious possibility. Yet in not taking part – or failing to even make your own case from a separate  – there’s also the risk of allowing your political opponents to gain traction. The problem, as we now know, is that once that happens it becomes very dficult to catch-up with your own counter-message and narrative, let alone gain an edge and take the lead in terms of input and impact. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Peter Robinson and Mike Nesbitt at the announcement of the subsequently short-lived Unionist Forum in January I noted in the column a couple of weeks ago that John Hume had more specic, lasting influence on successive UK governments than had any unionist equivalent. That’s because he took his case – at a time when people were barely even listening to local nationalism, because the electoral gap between unionism and non-unionism was so wide – to anyone and everyone who would open a door and incline an ear in London, Dublin, Washington or Brussels . That’s why so much of what used to be mocked by unionists as ‘Hume-speak’ found its way into government policy and subsequent political initiatives.With Northern Ireland’s centenary just around the cornerthere are a number of issues for unionists to consider. A centenary celebration will, by its very nature, focus attention on the past but it also involves surveying the presentand preparing for the future.In terms of the challenges unionists face, here are a number off the top of my head. The clash between the competing nationalisms across the United Kingdom the surge, influence and interests of a rebooted English nationalismthe rise of Scottish nationalism and Sinn Fein the combined impact of finally leaving the EU without a deal and the massive economic hit the UK has already taken from the pandemic the closing electoral gap between unionism and nationalism in Northern Ireland the rise of what can best be described as the ‘other’ demographic in Northern Ireland and how it can be kept within the pro-UK camp the outcome of an independence referendum in Scotlandand, of course, the looming shadow of a border poll .In September , at a dinner celebrating the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, Peter Robinson spoke about creating a Council for the Union to prepare for the  celebrations. Now, unless it is meeting and preparing and planning well below the radar I’m not aware of anything on the scale of which he was talking. And while it’s true that he and Mike Nesbitt jointly convened a Unionist Forum in January it is also true that it collapsed within a few months – with quite a few cross words.At this point I have no ideawhat Boris Johnson imagines will emerge from his Forum and Panel discussions. I don’t knowhe has given them a steer or an outline from which to work, orhe just intends to let them do their own thing as long as they provide him with an opportunity to do one of his rambling, hand-me-down Churchillian addresses to the nation. My fear – and it isn’t just a passing one, by the way – is that his references to Northern Ireland and ‘Ulster’ unionism will be so ambiguous and let’s-not-offend-anyone-at-all as to be utterly meaningless.In  Brian Faulkner fronted a three-day debate in the NI Parliament to mark the first half-centenary. In the absence of a unionist majority in the Assembly I’m not sure Arlene Foster would even consider such a debate. There’s no unionist majority in Belfast City Council, either so no cheerleading for the Union there. Who knows what Covid- restrictions might still be imposed upon us in the first six months of , orpublic celebrations of the Unionwill even be possible.Yet whatever happens it strikes me as essential that a united, coherent, pro-Union, pro-UKmessage is heard from unionism within Northern Ireland. Yes, we have serious challengesand issues from which we would be extraordinarily stupid to shy away but our identity, citizenship, political beliefs and sense of belonging to a pan-UK family is worth commemorating and celebrating.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh.

In a statement Ballyclare Secondary has said it will not be opening on Monday after a pupil tested positive for Covid-.The principal of Ballyclare Secondary School said the pupil had been in the school on Thursday,  August and it would reopen on Tuesday.On Friday it was announced that St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road in west Belfast would not be reopening as planned after someone connected to the school tested positive for coronavirus.And St Louise’s College, also on the Falls Road, also confirmed a positive case of Covid- among the school community.Yesterday the Department of Health COVID- report revealsed that  people have tested positive in the last  hours.Earlier a statement was released from the Chief Medical Officers and Deputy Chief Medical Officers of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales on the evidence of risks and benefits to health from schools and childcare settings reopening. It says: “The current global pandemic means that there are no risk-free options, but it is important that parents and teachers understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children.ChildrenWe are confident that multiple sources of evidence show that a lack of schooling increases inequalities, reduces the le chances of children and can exacerbate physical and mental health issues. School improves health, learning, socialisation and opportunities throughout the le course including employment. It has not been possible to reduce societal inequalities through the provision of home-based education alone. School attendance is very important for children and young people.We are confident in the extensive evidence that there is an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from COVID-. The infection fatality ratefor those aged  to  is estimated at  per million, lower than for most seasonal flu infections. Every death of a child is a tragedy but COVID- deaths in children and teenagers are fortunately extremely rare and almost all deaths are in children with signicant pre-existing health conditions.We are confident that there is clear evidence of a very low rate of severe disease in children of primary and secondary school ages compared to adults, eventhey catch COVID-. The percentage of symptomatic cases requiring hospitalisation is estimated to be .% for children aged  to  and .% among those aged  to , compared to a hospitalisation rate of over % in the UK for the general population. Most of these children make a rapid recovery.We are confident that there is clear evidence from many studies that the great majority of children and teenagers who catch COVID- have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.There is reasonable, but not yet conclusive, evidence that primary school age children have a signicantly lower rate of infection than adults .Evidence that older children and teenagers are at lower risk of catching COVID- is mixed. They are either less likely to catch COVID- than adults or have the same risk as adults.Transmission of COVID- to children in schools does occur. On current evidence it is probably not a common route of transmission. It may be lower in primary age children than secondary age children.Control measures such as hand and surface hygiene, cohorting to reduce number of daily contacts, and directional controls to reduce face-to-face contact remain key elements of maintaining COVID- secure school environments and minimising risk.Children and young people who were previously shielding were identied on a precautionary basis at a stage when we had less data on the effects of COVID- in children than we do now. Based on our better understanding of COVID- the great majority have now been advised they do not need to do so again, and that they shouldto school. A small number of children under paediatric carehave been or will be given inidual advice about any ongoing need to avoid infection.Our overall consensus is that, compared to adults, children may have a lower risk of catching COVID- , definitely have a much lower rate of hospitalisation and severe disease, and an exceptionally low risk of dying from COVID-. Very few,any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from COVID- due solely to attending school. This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school.Teachers, other school staff and parentsData from the UKsuggest teachers are not at increased risk of dying from COVID- compared to the general working-age population. ONS data identies teaching as a lower risk profession . International data support this.Transmission of COVID- to staff members in school does occur, and data from UK and international studies suggest it may largely be staff to staffrather than pupil to staff. This reinforces the need to maintain social distancing and good infection control inside and outside classroom settings, particularly between staff members and between older children and adults.If teachers, other school staff, parents or wider family catch COVID- their risks of severe illness are similar to those of other adults of the same age, ethnicity and health status. Younger adults have a much lower risk of severe COVID- than older adults. The greatest risk is to those over  years old.Current international evidence suggests transmission of COVID- from children of school age to parents or other adult family members is relatively rare compared to transmission from adults, but this evidence is weak. Teenagers may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children.Children and young people should be engaged in the process of establishing COVID- secure measures as key participants and promoters of safe communities to help protect their wider families, teachers and other school staff and other social networks. This will help reduce the risk of school outbreaks.Impact of opening schools on wider transmission Because schools connect households it is likely opening schools will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely and therefore increase R. We have confidence in the current evidence that schools are much less important in the transmission of COVID- than for influenza or some other respiratory infections. Other work and social environments also increase risk and are likely to be more important for transmission of COVID-.The international real-world evidence suggests that reopening of schools has usually not been followed by a surge of COVID- in a timescale that implies schools are the principal reason for the surge. There has, however, not been sufficient time to say this with confidence.On the other hand, a local or national surge in transmission in the community may lead to an increased risk of school outbreaks occurring.Opening schools may be as important in linking households indirectly as through direct transmission in school. For example allowing parents to go back to work, or meeting at the school gates, on public transport or in shared private vehicles, via after school social or sport activities or wrap-around care may be as important as what happens within the school.It is possible that opening schools will provide enough upward pressure on R that it goes above  having previously been below it, at least in some local areas. This will require local action and could mean societal choices that weigh up the implications of imposing limitations on dferent parts of the community and the economy.Early identication and quickly managing outbreaks of COVID- in schools is essential as part of a local response to COVID-. Clear advice for pupils and staff not to attend school with symptoms, and prompt availability of testing, appropriate isolation advice, and careful public health surveillance and monitoring of educational establishments are key to support the safeto schools”._________________________________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
