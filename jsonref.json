The artworks are part of an initiative from the artist Sam Harris, whose website the Online Art Show boasts the motto “If you can’t come to art then art will come to you” and features a selection of artists’ work to buy online.“It was an idea I had for artists to display art they had for sale,” says Harris. “The site takes you to their Instagram account or website so you can contact them to buy the artworks.”Harris’s website is an extension of his print zine Pure Filth which features 80 artists including the likes of Jake and Dinos Chapman and Noel Fielding. Gilbert \u0026amp George are not the only artists offering free window displays. The site also features art by Hayden Kays, otherwise known as the favourite artist of Harry Styles. Kays’ work comes in two parts, each featuring a different half of a rainbow – the first asks you to “stay home”, the second requests you “stay homo”.It’s not the only recent bit of public art Gilbert \u0026amp George have been involved with.

Playgrounds are wrapped in hazard tape. Swimming pools, national parks, holidays, birthday parties, cinemas, zoos, grandparents, friends – all the normal places and people of childhood are now off limits to this generation of children. But they still have books.For children in isolation around the world, books have taken on increased importance. They are a link to the world beyond. So here’s a non-exhaustive list of picture books that emphasise connection, curiosity and adventure within isolation or domesticity. Technically, these are books for young children – but don’t we all need a bit of beauty, play and comfort nowadays?by Davina Bell, illustrated by Allison ColpoysWhen everything is strange and newOn days when you need super glueThere’s so much room here just for youUnder my love umbrella.At a time when children are discouraged from seeing – let alone touching – loved ones who do not live with them, the language and images of Under the Love Umbrella feel achingly relevant. The book, by an Australian duo, traverses a novel conceit that unseen above the reader is an umbrella protecting and connecting that reader with the love of someone special to them. Here we are, huddled in our own homes, but shielded by a constant umbrella of love. Lovely, really.by Ahmadreza Ahmadi, illustrated by Ehsan AbdollahiAhmadi’s tale of a child who is given a box of crayons and an eraser, then decides to erase the world’s ills and replace them with beauty and peace, is a slow-moving, beautifully illustrated, poetic story of child empowerment. “Despair” is rubbed out and replaced in yellow crayon by the word “hope”. “Boredom” needs a blue crayon to replace it with “playing”. It’s a brave children’s book that mentions words including war, illness and hunger, but When I Coloured in the World is a book for children who know more about the world than we usually give them credit for, and gives them a wonderful creative agency to make it better. With crayons.For worlds within bedrooms, there is no better book on the planet than Sendak’s classic among classics. There are few children’s homes without a copy of Where the Wild Things Are, and while more than half a century old, the prose still feels sharp and the recognisable illustrations remain as engaging as ever. Max, banished to his bedroom for poor behaviour, is unfazed as the walls and floor around him turn to forest and seas to be traversed. His journey takes him to a kingdom of wild things of which he becomes monarch. The wild things are, it turns out, rather closer than we think – both a comfort and an opportunity for those now in confinement. There’s something to be said for parents, too, being able to turn to books from their own childhood as if nothing in the world has changed.by Libby Gleeson, illustrated by Freya BlackwoodAmy \u0026amp Louis is really a tale of a more ordinary isolation than that with which we have now become familiar – of friends parted by moving house. Gleeson’s softly told story follows best friends and neighbours Louis and Amy, who can no longer play with and call to each other after Amy moves far away. They mourn their friendship and their newfound loneliness but ultimately find that their connection can traverse distance and dreams. Blackwood’s gentle illustrations pair wonderfully with the simplicity of Gleeson’s prose and story. There is no mention of chaotic FaceTime catch-ups but rather a reassurance that friendship remains even when physical closeness does not.When we’re stuck at home, in truth, any book that encourages children to spend a significant amount of time thinking about and engaging anew with a single banal object is a welcome ersion. It Might Be an Apple from the Japanese author-illustrator Yoshitake follows one boy’s encounter with an apple left on a table. But, is it an apple? It may be an elaborate machine, it may be a fish in disguise, it might wish to be an aeroplane, or it may be an all-knowing being that turns hard and pointy when angry. Now is the time for curiosity and wonder in all things, and Yoshitake’s story is an ode to imagination.by Isabel Minhós Martins and Madalena MatosoThere’s a little subgenre of picture books in which the book speaks to the child reader as a book, and the physical object becomes a source of play. And within that subgenre, What’s That Noise? (This Book Is Calling You … ) is a good ’un. What makes Minhós Martins’ book particularly compelling coronavirus reading is the way in which it becomes a proxy for the natural world. Fingers are instructed to patter on the page, first as droplets and then as a storm. A tap of fingertips into a river – it feels cold, doesn’t it? – before the fingers prance from stone to stone across to the other side. A little worm is shielded in a cupped hand from a predatory black bird. When the outside is off-limits, this offers a quirky way to recall and re-enact the sensory adventure of the outdoors.by Oliver Jeffers and Sam WinstonThe beauty and power of children’s books is the subject of A Child of Books, which reads as much as a poetic manifesto as it does a story. It follows a girl as she asks a boy to come away with her to “mountains of make-believe” and other faraway, fantastical destinations contained within the pages of books. Jeffers and Winston collaborate on this beautiful invocation of the worlds within books. Text from classic stories forms part of the illustrations themselves, the stories building the book’s physical world. And as children speaking to the universe, it ends:For this is our world we’ve made from storiesOur house is a home of inventionWhere anyone at all can comeFor imagination is free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/010ee661e7492c2eef19886e8b8d80aa5acf8a40/0_163_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1098349cb5dffb4ee34843e618eb88","title":"supermarket staff workers tell us coronavirus affected your work","story":"Are you under extra pressure?

Initially, the Dublin-based carrier had said it would process refunds within 20 working days but soon started back-tracking.According to the travel industry’s own estimates, up to £7bn could be owed for cancelled trips. However, industry bodies such as Iata, for airlines, and Abta, for travel firms, say firms would be bankrupted by repaying now as they are receiving no booking revenue.Confidence in booking is likely to have plunged further since the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Friday that he would not book a summer holiday now. The Foreign Office has advised against non-essential foreign travel indefinitely.Which?, the consumer association, said 20 of the UK’s biggest biggest travel operators and airlines were breaking the law by not repaying money promptly. It has received thousands of complaints and requests for help from people struggling to secure refunds for cancelled trips, and said vouchers or credit notes could prove worthless if firms collapsed.However, it backed travel industry calls for the government to intervene, recognising that firms were under “unprecedented strain” and could go out of business should they process refunds immediately.While Which? said consumers’ legal right to cash refunds should be protected, it recommended extending the processing deadline to 28 days, and for any vouchers to be guaranteed against insolvency and eventually redeemable for cash. It also called for a definitive timescale for Foreign Office travel warnings, and transparent travel insurance terms and conditions, to help restore confidence.Which? researchers found 10 of the UK’s biggest holiday companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, are not offering full refunds within the legal limit of 14 days, with some only offering customers the choice of rebooking or a voucher. Some are withholding the air ticket price until received from the carrier.It also found almost all airlines are failing to refund passengers on time, with many customers unable to reach call centres to process complaints.Some carriers, such as Air France and KLM, have refused to offer refunds before a 12-month period has elapsed, issuing credit notes or allowing rebooking instead. Which? said it was “a fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of their passengers and the operational realities that every airline has to face”.Passengers booking with carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have told the  they have been unable to obtain refunds. Ryanair has issued vouchers and told customers requesting refunds that they are in queue. BA and easyJet customers have complained that call centre numbers are not being answered.A spokesperson for Airlines UK said: “Airlines are facing unprecedented challenges keeping vital routes open to repatriate stranded British travellers and transport critical medical supplies and PPE as part of cargo operations. Carriers are facing a far longer than usual volume of refund claims to get through and the current restrictions imposed nationally mean they are not able to bring in additional staff to deal with them. We are thankful to passengers for their continued patience.”Rory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: “We do not want to see the industry suffer further as a result of this outbreak, but it cannot be on consumers to prop up airlines and travel firms, especially when so many will be in difficult financial situations of their own.“The government must urgently set out how it will support travel firms and airlines to ensure they can meet their legal obligations to refund customers for cancelled travel plans, and avoid permanent damage to trust and confidence in the travel industry.”Some governments have already amended consumer legislation to allow deferred refunds, after calls from the airline body Iata. The Iata director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said earlier this month that refunding was “almost unbearable, financially speaking”, adding that airlines were “perfectly conscious of the difficulty for the passenger … but it is a matter of survival”.Abta said tour operators were being squeezed by refund requests for money that had been paid to suppliers, such as airlines and hotels, and not returned. Its chief executive, Mark Tanzer, said: “The UK government, despite repeated requests, has failed to recognise and respond to this reality, in stark contrast to the clear sensible actions taken by the European commission and many countries throughout Europe.“We fully understand and sympathise with the frustration that many customers may be feeling. But if companies are forced into bankruptcy, it will not only destroy livelihoods but extend the refund delays far beyond the term of refund credit notes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd2550cfdaea6be71f94fc7fa2bf81b7d3961005/0_382_5760_3458/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e921dfb2ba6d66d87ff8ac0fa10c49b","title":"corner shops describe life under lockdown as they stay open for their community","story":"Change in buying habits means many small shops are struggling to survive, while some are hit by shopliftersSome are doing home deliveries for the first time and tell of a heightened sense of caring in the community others tell of a rise in shoplifting, staff being spat at and a devastating collapse in grocery sales.As a third independent retailer dies from Covid-19, owners of corner shops across the UK tell the  about just how hard it is to cope in the pandemic.All of them are considered key workers, but they don’t have the support of retail giant owners who can offer personal protective equipment (PPE), screens, security staff or financial support when sales plummet.Yet they have one thing in common: a determination to stay open and keep serving their communities.Mohammed Faz, of Ashley’s News on Beehive Lane, has been a beacon of light for the community he serves. He is stocking yeast for the first time ever – “everyone is baking now” – though his initial offer of sanitiser and masks wasn’t successful.His store is quiet but he detected a change in custom overnight. “This community is older, people are not going up to the big shops, they can come in here, it’s safe and they know there are only one or two people in the shop at a time. So people are spending £100, £200,” he says.“They are buying everything here, toiletries, food, alcohol. They don’t want to go to the supermarkets because they don’t think they are safe.”Richard Inglis runs three shops in Southampton but has already closed one after sales plummeted from £30,000 a week to £5,000 in just five days. His staff have been abused, and he has been spat at by shoplifters. Inglis says small shops can’t afford the security personnel hired by the big supermarket chains.Over the past few weeks, a small group of drug users and street drinkers have started to hang round the front of his shop in front of the railway station daily. And they have become more sophisticated in their approach, he says.“Before, they used to come on their own, now they are coming in in teams wearing face masks, disguising their identity, and they will split up around the shop, grab whatever they can and make a dash for it. It’s worrying for my staff who have got anxieties about the virus and then these people in swearing and threatening to spit at you,” he said.“I got spat at in the face along with two of my staff by a woman the other week. She’s still on the streets. The police came and she was arrested but she was released on bail,” he explained. “The reality is if you shoplift, the biggest risk is you might be detained for 24 hours.”Omar Afzal runs the Shopsmart convenience store and post office on Saracen Street, north Glasgow and explains how people locally have adapted to the crisis.He and his staff now wear PPE, and customers take their own precautions, such as handing over their bank card in a sealed plastic bag so they can disinfect it when they get home.“It’s a very benefit-dependent area so people have not had a big shock to their income like other places. We didn’t get panic-buying here, I think that was more of a middle-class thing,” Afzal says.Like other similar shops, he adds: “We’ve seen a huge reduction in customer numbers but they tend to buy much more to keep them going.”He has now reduced the number of customers in the shop to three at a time, where they can browse three aisles selling everything from muesli to wrapping paper. People are buying more magazines and puzzle books now, as well as more vouchers for online gaming since the bookies closed.The mood of shoppers is usually good-humoured, he adds. “In an area like this it’s tough for people cooped up in flats and that can have an effect on mental health, so when people come out to the shop it’s a change of scenery, especially for children.“There’s a perception that we’re staying open for the money, but we’re key workers and we have a sense of responsibility. We are financially invested in the area but also emotionally. I’ve been here for 20 years and have seen people grow up.”Ankit Patel has recently taken over this small convenience store close to the Kingsmead Estate in London. At the outset of the lockdown he had considered closing, but felt it was important to stay open so locals could continue to top up their Oyster travel cards and use the Payzone to pay their bills.Sales have collapsed in the past few weeks, however, and he struggles to make ends meet. “We used to do 200-250 transactions a day. We’ve been open since 7am and it’s now 12.30am and we’ve had 21 transactions,” he told the  last week, checking the till.Patel blames panicked stockpiling last month. “People were panicking and they still have these things in their house, so they are only coming in here for milk and food,” he said.He is also witnessing hardship, with some customers offering to sell their phones and stolen goods. “We have people coming in to sell goods they have stolen from other shops, from supermarkets, not just groceries but things like jackets, bags,” he said.“Yesterday we had six or seven people in trying to sell their phones because they have run out of money. These are our regular customers. People are struggling, especially people who had temporary zero-hours jobs, or some people who… are also carers for elderly or sick people and they have no job, they are desperate.”Patel added that he was giving hard-up cases “a bit of credit” because he feels for them and he is part of the community.Bettyhill’s General Merchants is the only shop left open in the remote village of about 800 inhabitants on Scotland’s far north coast.Perched above the spectacular dunes of Torrisdale Bay, the road outside is eerily quiet. The shop is on the A836, on the most northerly section of the popular North Coast 500 touring route, but for now traffic is occasional and local.The owner of the convenience store and petrol station, Peter Malone, says he is still struggling to stock paracetamol after initial panic-buying. While locals still rely on the shop rather than making the 80-mile (130km) round trip to the nearest supermarket in Thurso, trade is down without the tourists. He is selling fewer sweets with no children dropping in after school, and local crofters are busy with lambing. But sales of butcher meat, bakery and milk are holding up.He has seen a significant increase in demand for home delivery. Last Friday he made 16, compared with the usual three or four before the weekend. “We knock the door and leave the shopping outside. Older people might want some help carrying it, so we take it into their kitchen and clean behind us on the way out.”Malone is used to the shop acting as a community hub, but this is made all the more apparent now in a village with a significant proportion of older residents. “It was always the case that we were the centre point, and people will tell us things that we then pass on. The mood in Bettyhill is fairly positive, most people are quite happy that we need to be in lockdown to protect the older population.”Lola Otuagomah is gazing out of the large window in a blue mask watching the near-empty buses go by. His is a destination shop for African food lovers and most, he says, are now too afraid to take the bus to get to him.He points to the shelves of plastic containers of freshly cooked food including Waakye, fresh moin-moin, jollof rice and pepper soup. “Usually these are already gone by now. I have only sold one today.”He is also afraid he will run out of stock as the lockdowns have meant supplies are not coming in of specialist milled grains, beans and nuts. “If the borders don’t open again it will be very, very difficult,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9db80245e390ae6f249c855865145bf7ad346c/0_284_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=716674f5f8290c3a125ec7a8a72280b4","title":"cornish copper find metal mining industry","story":"Cautious optimism that discovery of high-grade deposits could kickstart revival of metal miningA fresh discovery of copper in an area once labelled the richest square mile on Earth because of its abundant metal deposits has raised the possibility of a revival for one of the UK’s most historical industries.During exploration for lithium in hot underground springs in Cornwall, engineers came instead upon high-grade copper in a previously unmined area.Further drilling will take place to confirm the extent of the discovery in the parish of Gwennap, near Redruth, but there is cautious optimism that the discovery could kickstart something of a comeback for the industry.“It’s a very exciting new discovery,” said Richard Williams, the chief executive of Strongbow Exploration, which owns the mineral rights at the site United Downs. “It tells us there are areas of mineralisation that are relatively close to the surface and are potentially mineable. The plan is to get back in there and do some additional drilling to find out how big the zone is.”The copper was 100 metres down but the company believes the zone could extend close to the surface. Surrounding mines were worked to a depth of 500 metres below the surface. Williams said: “The hope is that this zone continues to that depth and continues laterally east and west.”Cornwall has a long and proud mining history stretching back to the early bronze age. Reserves of copper, tin, zinc, silver and arsenic have all been exploited for many centuries.Gwennap was the richest copper producing region in Cornwall (and the world) in the 18th and early 19th centuries, earning it the title of “the richest square mile on Earth”.As well as making fortunes for mine owners, the industry had a profound effect on the cultural life and social history of the far south-west of Britain.It gave the world the Cornish pasty – originally a wholesome and practical lunch for miners – and was a backdrop for Winston Graham’s Poldark novels, which were turned into television hits in the 1970s and again more recently.In the face of competition from abroad and falling demand, mining declined in Cornwall and the county’s last surviving tin mine, South Crofty, shut down in 1998.But in July 2016 Strongbow Exploration took on South Crofty along with additional mineral rights covering an area of approximately 15,000 hectares (37,065 acres) scattered throughout Cornwall, including the United Downs project.Strongbow entered into an agreement with a company called Cornish Lithium in January 2017. Cornish Lithium was given the right to explore Strongbow’s mineral rights for lithium in underground salt water, while Strongbow retained the right to any discoveries in hard rock that it came upon.The work at South Crofty continues. Strongbow recently applied for a permit to drill at the mine. Owen Mihalop, the company’s chief operating officer, said: “The intention is to demonstrate that there is potential to discover a lot more, in particular tin mineralisation at South Crofty. The Covid-19 crisis has delayed that.”He added: “I think in general people in Cornwall would like to see a resurgence in the industry. The feedback we have received around South Crofty is that people would like to see that back in production. This is a historical mining area. On the whole I think people are positive about the jobs and economic benefits mining can bring.”A spokesperson for Cornish Lithium said: “Cornish Lithium continues to enjoy a strong relationship with Strongbow Exploration and is excited about the opportunities that this discovery highlights for the mining industry in Cornwall.“Separately, Cornish Lithium is equally encouraged by the results from our exploration drilling programme for lithium in geothermal waters at this site and are continuing to evaluate the opportunity to extract lithium in this area and elsewhere in Cornwall.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be8b5dcf6d7ad77ca4dfb347ee6f6ab8d9c352e/0_139_5154_3092/master/5154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef895af233c62a741eae5d5e79535ad8","title":"ryanair boss says airline wont fly with idiotic social distancing rules","story":"Michael O’Leary says business model will be in tatters if he is forced to leave middle seats emptyRyanair planes won’t return to the skies if the airline is forced to leave the middle seat empty to comply with “idiotic” in-flight social distancing rules, its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has said.The boss of the no-frills carrier, which has thrived by packing its flights as full as possible with passengers lured by low prices, has previously said that blocking out the space in between aisle seats is “nonsense” that would have no beneficial effect.He doubled down on the comments on Wednesday, saying that if governments insisted on social distancing measures, then Ryanair’s business model would be in tatters and the carrier would not fly.O’Leary said that Ryanair had already told the Irish government that if it imposes the restriction, then “either the government pays for the middle seat or we won’t fly”.The Dublin-based carrier’s business model relies on flying as frequently as possible, stripping out costs and running an extremely high “load factor”, the aviation industry term for how full planes are.“Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn’t deliver any social distancing, so it’s kind of an idiotic idea that doesn’t achieve anything anyway,” he added, in an interview with the Financial Times.The global airline industry’s trade body, Iata, has predicted huge ramifications for airlines as a result of Covid-19, with lost revenues this year set to hit $314bn (£255bn).Ryanair’s no-frills rival easyJet has said it expects socially distanced flights to be possible in the short term, given that demand for air travel is likely to be subdued in any case, even after lockdown restrictions ease off.O’Leary said European airlines should instead take their cue from Asia and impose different safety measures, such as forcing passengers to wear masks or checking their temperature at the airport.Ryanair flew more than 152 million people last year, putting it at the top of the league table of European airlines, a position that gives O’Leary a particularly influential voice in the industry.He sounded a more upbeat tone than some of his rivals, predicting a return to normal passenger numbers by summer 2021, provided a vaccine for Covid-19 can be developed.He said the airline would be able to pick up business from rivals that collapse as a result of the pandemic, which has already forced Virgin Australia to file for bankruptcy and left Ryanair’s European rival

firms plan legal action against hiscox over covid 19 insurance claims","story":"More than 100 pubs and nightclubs join forces over non-payment of pandemic claimsMore than 100 nightclubs, pubs and bars are planning coordinated legal action against the insurer Hiscox over its non-payment of business interruption insurance claims.Hiscox sold policies before coronavirus hit the headlines, stating it would pay out when a business was forced to shut owing to a notifiable disease.Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers only to be told their business interruption policies do not cover the pandemic.Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which is coordinating the action, said: “Businesses are being denied legitimate insurance claims, many claims are being disputed by insurers based on contrived arguments to avoid sharing the financial burden during the Covid-19 crisis.”Paul Daly, the owner of Roadtrip \u0026amp The Workshop bars, housed in one building in Shoreditch, in London, and a member of the NTIA group, said he paid £18,000 a year for his business interruption insurance policy with Hiscox, which he believed included cover for government-imposed shutdowns during a pandemic.Daly’s takings plunged to zero when his venue closed on 17 March but his claim with Hiscox has been turned down. “People’s livelihoods are at stake here. I’m worried. It shouldn’t have to be into this when I’ve spent tens of thousands of pounds on insurance. It’s like someone came into my bar and bought a drink and then I don’t give it to them.”The group, which is being advised by the licensing industry barrister Philip Kolvin QC, is calling on more businesses to join its move against the insurer.On Wednesday, Hiscox said it had about 10,000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures.It said its core small commercial package policies did not provide cover for business interruption as a result of the “general measures” taken by the government in response to the pandemic.It said in a statement: “A number of UK policyholders have disputed the application of their policy in relation to business interruption. Hiscox recognises these are extremely difficult times for businesses and is determined to help provide greater certainty for customers. As a priority it will therefore work with the UK insurance industry, its regulators and its customers to seek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available.”The NTIA action comes as two separate Hiscox action groups, together involving about 200 more claimants, also consider legal action. The chef Raymond Blanc has also reportedly signed up lawyers after being denied a payout by Hiscox.One action group backed by the insurance brokers advisory firm CEC, representing more than 30 businesses including gyms, restaurants and golf professionals, said at least some of Hiscox’s policies clearly state it would pay up where the interruption to the business was “due to restrictions imposed by a public authority during the period of insurance following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease”.Roger Topping, of the action group, said some of the policies stated payouts would reflect how the business would have traded if the restrictions had not been imposed.Business interruption policies typically pay up to £100,000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000.

Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.Simon Ager, who runs the Pinnacle climbing centre in Northampton, started an action group that now has more than 100 members after being told his policy with Hiscox, including cover for losses up to £100,000, would not pay out on coronavirus pandemic claims.On Wednesday, Hiscox said it had about 10,000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures.Hiscox added it was “actively settling claims” for event cancellation and abandonment, media and entertainment and other industries including travel. It expects to pay out $150m (£120m) to settle claims if restrictions on travel and mass gatherings continue for six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/197623d3af2e03d5f268aab3ec6a6be25f29b399/0_432_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5416bdf56b46f4e8e5ae83b419c05c41","title":"are you a shambolic first time runner i was too until a coach gave me some tips","story":"Slow as I was, it wasn’t until I caught my reflection in a shop window that I realised something was wrong. Then I was told what to do with my arms and legsJoggers are coming in for some stick, what with all their droplets and rule-infringing pavement hogging. I feel no anger towards them, only concern and pity – because there are some gaits from hell out there. Arms flail around, above legs uncoordinated with them often the legs barely coordinate with each other. They are making it so hard for themselves and will surely get injured. It’s not their fault it’s unlikely they’ve ever been taught how to run properly.I got into running when I was about 30. I weighed 18 stone, about three stone of which I plainly needed to lose. At the time, there wasn’t a lot of this HIIT fast interval training caper around it was all about putting in lots of slow, steady miles. As we all keep saying, it is very important to follow the science, so that is what I did: hours and hours plodding streets, parks, river paths, hills, fields and mountains. After each run, again following the science (well, my interpretation of it anyway), I troughed carbohydrate-heavy fare in great quantities. My longest training run lasted six hours. My biggest post-run feed involved an entire wholemeal loaf and bunch of bananas.My first marathon was in New York. I romped home in several seconds less than five hours. For a week I couldn’t get up or down stairs, or on or off a toilet, without assistance. In all I ran three more marathons, running many hundreds of miles in training, without losing an ounce. In my last race, I beat four hours by all of 17 seconds if there was an 18 stone-plus category, I may have been well-placed. I only eventually lost weight by running less, and eating a lot less, but that’s another story.Slow and heavy as I was, I still rather fancied myself as a runner. But then, jogging past some shops early on a spring morning, I saw my reflection. And what a shambles I was, lolloping on, shoulders hunched and head bowed. My posture is terrible at the best of times. On a good day, I resemble the chap in second place on that drawing of the five evolutionary stages of man. On a bad day, I’m the one behind him. While running, I was the one behind that.I went to see a running coach, Mike Antoniades, who filmed me on a treadmill. The most bizarre thing was my arms. The left one pumped backwards and forwards, while the right arm pumped to and fro across my body.“Do you carry a shoulder bag much?” he asked.“That’ll be it.”I called Mike this week and, predictably, he is in despair at what he is seeing out there. There is a lot more to it than this, but I will pass on a couple of tips. First, the arms, which Mike says are important: “Think of them as pistons.” They should be bent at around 90 degrees and should pump back and forth in as straight a line as possible, and never across the middle of the body. Concentrate on thrusting the elbows backwards a good way, and the arms’ forward movement will look after itself. It is similar for the legs: keep them moving in a straight line and make sure that each time a leg goes back, the lower half (the calf bit) of it finishes at least parallel with the ground.Sadly, my joints are now so knackered from the mega-hours of plodding I put in 20 years ago that I can’t run much these days. I am still embarrassingly slow, as the grandparent who overtook me pushing a pram yesterday will confirm, but by God, I’m good to look at. Poetry in slow motion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8cc1c56b823aa0b323cf219744ab1c01e67452/0_60_3300_1982/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d83c311e159d7156eb79167bb35b863","title":"briton no 10 leadership power vacuum coronavirus","story":"With a power vacuum in Westminster, devolved leaders such as Nicola Sturgeon are already voicing dissent on vital coronavirus issuesShould we all be wearing masks to go out in public? Sadiq Khan, London’s Mayor, publicly broke ranks last week to argue for compulsory face-covering on public transport and as I write, the government’s scientific advisers are re-reviewing the pros and cons after Germany and the US started recommending masks for ordinary members of the public.Fears remain that a run on masks could either leave NHS workers dangerously short of them or make wearers overconfident, if they don’t realise that mask-wearing is about trying to protect other people rather than yourself. But look around your nearest supermarket to see how many people are no longer waiting for ministers to make their minds up at the weekend, I spotted everything from strategically positioned scarves to cycling kit, builders’ dust masks and home-stitched floral numbers. Whatever the experts conclude, Khan seems to be going with the grain of public instinct, and if the advice does ultimately change then he’ll have left government looking slow-footed even if it has hesitated for the best of reasons. (Ministers are taking their lead from the World Health Organization, which still isn’t recommending masks for general public use.)But this isn’t just about masks. The inevitable leadership vacuum created by Boris Johnson’s illness is starting to be filled less by ambitious lieutenants – although the news of an anonymous Downing Street source briefing against Matt Hancock’s promise of 100,000 tests a day suggests things are getting alarmingly fractious – than by emboldened devolved leaders. Nicola Sturgeon has already warned Scotland won’t necessarily follow whatever path Johnson eventually sets out of lockdown, promising to treat Scots like “the grownups you are” by laying out her own personal thinking this week. (The echo of Angela Merkel, praised for providing detailed explanations of the science underpinning her decisions rather than fobbing off tough questions with invocations of Dunkirk spirit, is surely deliberate.) Even Wales’s first minister Mark Drakeford, while worrying that it would be harder to enforce lockdown rules that varied across the country, has said he would “do things differently” in Wales if necessary. If Downing Street tries to lift the lockdown too quickly, it could trigger a constitutional showdown like that unfolding in the US, where inidual state governors have chosen to protect their citizens by defying Donald Trump’s attempts to reopen the economy. And while it’s one thing brushing off questions about why Britain isn’t doing what South Korea is doing, it’s quite another explaining why Scotland appears to have no confidence in your strategy.A cynic might say all this is dangerous game-playing by Labour and SNP politicians facing elections next spring, who won’t want to be seen as having blindly followed in Westminster’s footsteps if by then the public mood has turned. (For now, polling shows voters are still more supportive of this government’s handling of the epidemic than the left likes to think, although with doubts creeping in about NHS workers being properly protected from the virus the failure of a much-vaunted big shipment of protective equipment from Turkey to materialise forms part of a bigger worrying pattern of overpromising and underdelivering.) It does the Scottish nationalist cause in particular no harm for Sturgeon to emerge looking like a plausible alternative to Westminster leadership in a crisis.But you can’t devolve education and health policy and then expect devolved governments not to use their powers in a once-in-a-generation emergency, and nor can practical differences to everyday lives be ignored. Talking about schools possibly starting to come back in July, fitting in a few weeks’ teaching before the holidays, makes sense in England but not in Scotland where schools break up at the end of June. Masks could well give city-dwellers confidence about getting back on the Tube, but would the balance of risks and benefits be the same in sparsely populated rural areas where most people drive to work?Half the point of devolution was to acknowledge that what works for one part of the union doesn’t always work everywhere, and to manage the resulting tensions. But when the centre starts to falter, looking uncertain or ided, it’s in the nature of politics that rival power bases will grow. If Downing Street doesn’t get a grip, the next public spat may be about something more fundamental than a piece of cloth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69e947f000b65055ad8e3e3a067d3ce9ff6f7a7/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=491e1292aa3671acdf0681c8e25696f4","title":"the guardian view on creatives in purdah dont leave culture to netflix","story":"There is no prospect of cinemas, theatres or other venues opening any time soon. The arts need more helpWhen the lockdown is lifted, more shops and perhaps schools are likely to reopen first, along with workplaces where continued physical distancing is practical.At the very back of the queue will likely be the places and people who provide cultural stimulation, ersion and entertainment for the rest of us, shining a light on who we are and what we do. Netflix may never have had it so good, as housebound populations seek ersion in their laptops and flatscreens. ITV has found ways of making a drama, in four parts, out of the coronavirus crisis.But many actors, dancers, writers, musicians, set designers, roadies, photographers, sound recordists and film-makers must languish in an artistic form of purdah for the foreseeable future. Who knows when the next packed gig, or sold-out theatre, will echo to cheers and applause?For the most part, this is a world where employment is perilously short-term and cashflow precarious. Some small theatres and venues may never make it to the other side of this crisis. Bank accounts are running dry. The creative industries in Britain employ two million people and a third of those are self-employed – more than double the national average. Many have set up as one-person limited companies to make themselves easier to employ. As a result, they have fallen through the cracks of the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s schemes to protect jobs and incomes. Other freelancers will not have access to payments under the self-employment income support scheme until June. A creative sector normally worth £110bn to the economy may lose a generation of impoverished talent to the economic devastation caused by coronavirus.Over a hundred MPs and high-profile cultural figures, including David Puttnam and Floella Benjamin, have backed calls for a dedicated package of assistance. In a letter to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, the signatories pointed to the example of Germany, where Mr Dowden’s counterpart, Monika Grütters, made specific provision for creative industries in a €50bn aid package for small businesses and freelancers. The assistance comes in the form of grants, loans and housing costs. Cities and regions have also played their part. In Berlin, freelance artists have been able to access €5,000 with minimum bureaucracy attached. A spokesman for the city’s leftwing senator for culture, Klaus Lederer, said: “It is our absolute aim to preserve the overwhelming richness and variety of Berlin’s cultural life for a vibrant future.”In a time of crisis art becomes more central to our lives. Arts Council England has provided £160m to help theatres and arts organisations survive. But broader and deeper assistance, along the lines of the German model, is needed. Until a month ago, Britain’s creative industry was the fastest-growing and most dynamic sector of the economy. As we continue to be confined to the sofa, Netflix sensations such as Tiger King will keep us entertained. But our cultural alternatives will be diminished when Britain re-emerges from lockdown, unless we do more for our creative industries now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48978aee08976b3b1c37bb6cde1534be2b7bf357/0_149_5906_3542/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f49b64ba28e9ed419a5512d92c296d95","title":"the guardian view on dominic raab out of his depth","story":"The understudy prime minister is exposing many of the structural flaws that characterise Boris Johnson’s governmentDominic Raab’s tenure as Brexit secretary in 2018 was short and fruitless. He negotiated nothing in Brussels and resigned in protest, as if the failure was not his own. It is worth recalling that record now because Mr Raab has temporarily risen to the highest office, which is higher than his capabilities should allow.Acting as prime minister during Boris Johnson’s illness is an unenviable task. The stand-in did not take decisions he must now defend, and has no executive authority to fix mistakes. Mr Johnson’s absence can be felt as drift and incoherence, expressed most potently in confusion over coronavirus testing and supplies of vital medical equipment.Keir Starmer raised both subjects in his Commons debut as Labour leader on Wednesday. On both fronts he exposed the void where Mr Raab must have wished he had answers. The foreign secretary floundered most under questioning on testing, where the rate lags far behind what would be necessary to hit the target of 100,000 per day by the end of this month. He attempted a sleight of hand, defending the government’s record in terms of elevated testing capacity, an easier metric and not what had initially been pledged. Mr Starmer’s efficiency in identifying and dismissing that trick bodes well for when it is Mr Johnson at the despatch box and not his understudy.On equipment supplies, Mr Raab’s defence was propped up by two flimsy planks: first, that no country is managing without difficulty second, that every decision has been taken in accordance with the best available scientific advice. If there was ever merit in those claims it has worn thin from overuse by ministers evading responsibility for the lethal consequences of their actions – and inaction. It is disingenuous and improbable to suggest that ministers have followed a technocratic template, impeded only by logistical challenges beyond their control. Political prejudice infiltrates most decisions in government and Mr Johnson’s Downing Street is one of the most ideologically driven, politically cynical administrations in British history. It is likely that medical expertise was heeded, given that no one in the cabinet had relevant qualifications, but the equivalent skills deficit in other areas has never stopped the prime minister from having a strong opinion and acting on it before. Brexit is a case in point, where decisions of national importance were routinely taken in disregard of advice from people with professional expertise in the relevant fields.It is plausible that the scale of the coronavirus threat forced ministers to set ideology aside. The Treasury response demonstrates that much in its swift abandonment of orthodox Conservative fiscal policy. But it is also feasible that Mr Johnson and his team took longer than necessary to climb out of some ideological trenches because they had dug themselves in so deep. That lag might help clear up confusion surrounding an EU procurement scheme for medical equipment, which Britain either joined or did not join for reasons that mysteriously vary depending on whether it is a civil servant, a minister or Brussels accounting for events.On Tuesday, a senior foreign office official told a parliamentary committee that the decision not to participate had been political. Hours later he “clarified” to the contrary, but his written retraction contained no clarification of facts. The truth will surely emerge one day, probably in front of a public inquiry.Meanwhile, the episode reinforces the impression of a government that was ill prepared for a crisis that demanded competence more than rhetorical bluster, and is failing now to get sufficient grip and undo damage done. Partly that is a symptom of over-centralisation and reliance on the inidual authority of the prime minister, whose focus is necessarily elsewhere. But capable ministers and a resilient administration would be compensating better for Mr Johnson’s absence. That they are not, that the whole system seems obviously adrift, running on bluster and improvisation, testifies to flaws. Mr Raab is obviously out of his depth. Sadly, it seems his painfully shrunken stature is an accurate measure of the government he currently leads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4614a7add9d855c0fcf9f0cb3b68599bd41865f/0_382_5760_3458/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=bc6ea1b6e637ec502a90f36049678993","title":"schools and exam boards undermine promise to pupils of september tests","story":"Government assurance candidates in all subjects can choose a delayed exam unravels A row is brewing between examination boards, schools, the government and England’s exam regulator over whether pupils unhappy with their assessed GCSE or A-level grades will have the chance to sit the exams in autumn, as promised.When the Department for Education and Ofqual, the exam regulator, announced that this summer’s GCSE and A-level exams would be cancelled and replaced with assessed grades, students were told they would have the option to take the exams “as soon as reasonably possible” after schools reopen following the summer holidays.But that promise – repeated by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson – is in danger of being undermined by a reluctance among exam boards to create a costly set of extra exams if schools discourage pupils from taking part.The boards also fear that subjects with only a small number of entries, such as modern languages including Arabic and Japanese, would see only a handful of pupils wanting to sit exams in the autumn.Ofqual said decisions on which exams will be offered is up to inidual exam boards, although that could change, depending on a consultation. “Unless we decide otherwise, the default position will be that exam boards will decide which exams to make available to students in the autumn series,” the regulator said.Such a decision would run counter to directions given by Williamson, who told Ofqual in a ministerial letter dated 31 March: “The government considers that students who do not feel their calculated grade reflects their ability should be afforded an opportunity to sit an exam at the earliest reasonable opportunity.“Accordingly, I hereby direct Ofqual to take account of this policy and work with the exam boards and others to plan to enable this group of students to sit exams as soon as reasonably possible after schools and colleges are open again.”However, some head teachers are opposed to having pupils sit GCSE exams in their first term as sixth formers, arguing that this is “totally impractical” and would interfere with pupils learning the A-level or BTec subjects they had just begun to study.The rebel heads also say that a full suite of exams in October or November would further disrupt school life, taking teachers out to act as assessors and examiners, or forcing them to oversee revision.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which mainly represents secondary school heads, said it favoured only GCSE maths and English exams and those for major A-level subjects being offered before Christmas.Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s general secretary, told TES, which first reported the move: “Other GCSEs are very important for progression but they are superseded by other qualifications taken later down the line, while GCSE English and maths, and A-levels, have an enduring significance for the inidual.“It would, therefore, seem reasonable that in the current circumstances an opportunity is provided to sit these exams in the event that a student is unhappy with the grade awarded in the summer.”Failing to hold the extra exams would mean that pupils unhappy with their assessed grades – which will be administered by the exam boards and Ofqual using teacher recommendations – would have no means to improve them until GCSEs or A-levels in spring 2021. Appeals are only allowed against the process followed, not the grades themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc9acf4afc60d0c2aba0de88b05b0896adb897b/0_185_5568_3343/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64a1aa39a3cb7f6ba57c19ee962494b2","title":"earth day greta thunberg calls for new path after pandemic","story":"Climate activist says Covid-19 outbreak shows change can happen when we listen to scientistsGreta Thunberg has urged people around the world to take a new path after the coronavirus pandemic, which she said proved “our society is not sustainable”.The Swedish climate activist said the strong global response to Covid-19 demonstrated how quickly change could happen when humanity came together and acted on the advice of scientists.She said the same principles should be applied to the climate crisis.“Whether we like it or not, the world has changed. It looks completely different now from how it did a few months ago. It may never look the same again. We have to choose a new way forward,” she told a YouTube audience in a virtual meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.“If the coronavirus crisis has shown us one thing, it is that our society is not sustainable. If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.”The teenage campaigner, who initiated the global school strike movement, was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockström, the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute.He said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. “The scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis,” he said. “We are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.”The lockdown has reduced emissions and hurt the oil industry, which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels. But the two speakers stressed the virus should not be seen as an environmental panacea because it has brought immense human suffering, provided only temporary respite and distracted from campaigns, research and international meetings that aimed to find a smoother transition to a clean economy.The key lesson from the pandemic, they said, was the need for governments to pay more heed to scientific warnings.“We have underestimated the shocks. We need to build more shock absorbers into the system,” Rockström said. “Around the world, people are recognising the uncertainty and are being cautious. Also regarding the climate, we cannot know for certain how far we can push up global warming. So I hope that we come out of the pandemic with the recognition that science shows: it’s not worth taking the risk ... I believe that something new is coming from the ashes of the corona crisis. We’ll rise out of this, but not by bouncing back to the old world.”He said there was more support now for green new deals in Europe and South Korea and for China to go beyond the economy when setting priorities.Neither speaker mentioned the US president, Donald Trump, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, or other leaders who have either dismissed the risk of the pandemic or used it to relax environmental protections and health standards in the name of economic recovery. But Thunberg alluded to these dangers.“During a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said. “I cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn’t slide in the wrong direction.”Elsewhere, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper.He said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs taxpayer support for sustainable growth an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation.Public opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and Extinction Rebellion. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets.“We have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis,” she said. “People are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c80883bdbe3e3a30a2bbc3f5bba26ace40e38b2/0_142_2069_1241/master/2069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e7549a92514d76e730844bad384c31","title":"new big 5 wildlife photography project in pictures","story":"An international initiative aims to do away with the old big five of wildlife – based on the toughest animals to shoot and kill – and create a new selection based on photography, not hunting.

But if you look at who some of these brands are – H\u0026ampM, Target, Zara, C\u0026ampA – they have huge bottom lines.My hope for a post-coronavirus future is one that values those in the supply chain. Garment workers are the heart of the fashion industry but are treated the worst and often come from the most marginalised communities.Am I hopeful? On the one hand, many of us have been saying the same thing for years. But there is a shifting tide. It is a unique moment because consumers are paying attention and reorienting our relationship with consumption. Governments and corporations are being called out and garment workers are continuing to resist, as they always have.Now is the time to reimagine new systems. I am challenging myself and others – beyond these systems that we are critiquing, let’s propose alternatives. There is a meaningful transnational solidarity that can be done right now, from Los Angeles, from Bangladesh.My hope for the future is that fashion brands can put together better, more transparent supply chains. Many brands have long put forth that the reason they contract to factories in places such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia is to lift workers out of poverty and bring jobs to those regions. Yet the majority of these brands have cancelled their orders and threatened to withhold payments even for finished clothing, even though they have the money. They are thus throwing these countries into economic meltdown.With the factory closed and workers furloughed, now is the time to be replacing old machines with new, state-of-the-art, cleaner and safer systems. I hope brands will streamline and I hope there will be some near-shoring and re-shoring and right-shoring, because we are going to keep having crises like this and supply chains are such delicately balanced systems like dominoes, if one goes down, it all goes down.Brands need to not be so vulnerable by becoming more independent and, in a sense, more truly global. You have one third of your manufacturing in one part of the world, one third in another, another third in another some of it’s far, some of it’s close. Bring some manufacturing home instead – there is such great advantage to localising. But more than that, companies should take on the responsibility of looking after workers and making sure everything is sourced cleanly and leftovers are disposed of correctly.Before coronavirus we were already discussing the need to stop and reevaluate. But nobody was voluntarily going to stop, because it’s business. This has forced us to stop and even big conglomerates like LVMH are thinking: “What does fashion actually mean now?” This is going to make designers look introspectively and think: “How much am I going to make?”I am hopeful that it is going to allow us to redefine the fashion schedule. I was talking to Patrick McDowell, Bethany Williams and other young designers in London about getting tired of all the stuff we had to produce. Two collections a year is enough, without all the pre-collections. The BFC could put out a statement, setting out all the reasons why it makes sense – but it would need to be an international effort.I hope that because of this young and emerging designers might have more of a voice in the room when big decisions are being made about the industry. Coronavirus is pushing everything online and online platforms are giving people who potentially wouldn’t have had much of a say before, a massive say. Nobody is going to fashion week but Ahluwalia Studio just dropped the Matches collection through Instagram – it’s so much more powerful because it’s coming straight from the brand.Unfortunately it took a shock like this for companies to open their eyes and see that the systems they have built around profit and growth can crumble easily there isn’t any resilience and retail is being hit really hard. It feels like everything is opening up so it can be scrutinised and redesigned. We need to put the health of our ecosystems at the heart of our business systems. That means designing systems from a human, community-centred perspective rather than one that is profit-centred, like we have now with capitalism.Everyone can learn a lot from adopting a more resilient business model for example, businesses already built around a slow fashion mentality and sustainable growth, such as Eileen Fisher, are not being affected tremendously by this storm. The systems that are thriving are those that were built around community, planet, kindness, and ecosystems.We need to design a production model that doesn’t overproduce and over-manufacture because a system that yields over-consumption cannot last. I don’t think the public or the employees will allow a return to business as usual. There are a lot of unions being formed, such as at Everlane, and there is growing solidarity among employees across companies. Right now we are seeing that collective action is not actually that difficult. There is only one way from here: up.The fashion industry is facing a massive crisis, but after a period of restriction we tend to fall back into excess. I anticipate that there will be a return to business as usual – and younger, emerging designers will need our support. But I also hope that we pause and realise we don’t necessarily need 12 pairs of jeans and God knows how many sweatpants.I hope it makes us value the concept of buying less, buying better and perhaps buying a little bit less cheap finding ways to be able to afford things that are locally made and from brands that are so small as to have innovation and sustainability embedded from the start. It’s a good opportunity to break the hegemony of the big guys, so that we won’t need to double check that Zara and H\u0026ampM really are doing what they say they are doing. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the high street didn’t return to the same-old same-old, but instead had mending services, smaller designers, tailors, rental places and swapping places.When we come out of this, it will be about capturing that joy of nothingness – the joy of having had less, of having been limited. I want people to focus on the positives in order to grow from it. Almost everybody has become an expert on coronavirus, so why not become an expert on sustainable fashion?The post Covid-19 future I want to live in is one where we take our time with our purchases and make more considered decisions about our spending carefully deciding whether we truly need the item and if the maker reflects our values. I essentially want to return to a post-fast fashion world.The companies that have used unethical labour and unsustainable practices need to either correct their issues fully or go away. The economy is delicate but I believe that supporting small businesses with ethics at their core will be the way to get ourselves out of this mess and rebuild a fashion industry we can all believe in. The lockdown has been a gigantic wakeup call for the industry. What we do next is equally as important.I believe this pandemic has made us realise that rather than seeking material things, we have found value in human connection more than ever. It took a pandemic for many of us to see the broken system behind our “stuff”: a system that says essential workers should keep us safe and fed, but without personal protective equipment, insurance or decent salaries a system that allows big corporation bailouts at the expense of our planet, clean air and our health. The list goes on.Yet, in the midst of the chaos and injustice, we are seeing iniduals and small businesses fill the gaps – from making or securing PPE, ventilators, and tests, to online movements like #payupfashion. The world we are after is unfolding right in front of us. What I’m hoping for is already happening: transparency, interconnectedness and human flourishing, which are all integral to building a circular economy.My hope is that we will be seeing a shift in values and consumer behaviour. We so often talk about the power of the consumer to change the fashion industry for the better and now is really the chance. While having been quarantined and experiencing a global crisis with devastating economic and social costs, I hope we have all had a wakeup call in terms of what really matters.With regards to fashion, I hope this means having a much bigger appreciation for fashion that is value-driven supporting the brands that are authentic, inclusive and transparent. Fashion that – a bit of a cliche perhaps - cares for the planet and people, and not only profit.During the five-week quarantine in Denmark, I bought a pair of (comfortable!) trousers. This purchase was a special one, because more than ever I reflected not on the usual things like fit, fabric, quality, colour – but rather: “Where should I put my money? Which brand to support?” I hope this will become the new normal, supporting the businesses that do it better. Let’s shift the focus away from ourselves and our self-centred needs, and think twice about our actions. Can purchasing a garment from a particular brand actually make a difference?My hope for fashion in a post Covid-19 world would be for the people who power supply chains – from retail, warehouse, to the factory floor – to be treated as assets rather than cost centres. I would hope to see sustainable brands that work in close partnership with worker-owned factories and unionised warehouses so that there are safety nets and protection for the people working across the fashion supply chain.With the pandemic, as fashion sales have contracted and retail stores have closed, brands have cancelled orders already in production, with suppliers fronting both material and labour cost. This liquidity crunch has resulted in millions of garment maker layoffs without severance, savings or access to healthcare. The women who have kept this industry profitable for decades have been left food-insecure and without safety nets. This is why at Remake we have been working tirelessly to engage brands with our #PayUp campaign.The pandemic has brought all of the broken systems to the surface. Looking at that through a positive lens, in all of this chaos there is an opportunity for us to redefine them. We know we are going to be going through breakdowns for the foreseeable future – either pandemic or environmental issues – so to try to get back to to the status quo would be crazy. People are going to have to put the planet before their idea of profits.For iniduals and businesses it’s about how to build the strongest boat to weather all storms. We are brainstorming around this right now. We are going to have to get off the schedule. It’s a precarious dance, because we still need money coming in, but is September going to mean us showing spring collections because we know that is where money could come in? Or are we willing to take those chances, not show up and forge our own way?One way of building a stronger vessel is through owning more of our business. We are focusing on the most solidified, transparent aspects of our existing one and leaning into those parts. The same applies with the fibres we use - where is that being grown, woven and cut? Some bigger companies will rather go back to a broken system than be in the discomfort of pioneering. But it’s going to take everyone being willing to risk new ways of doing things. Maybe that’s going to mean less money and that’s OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a4f38f9ef901f9bcc2ef13414a77e3bd6146ef/567_202_5436_3261/master/5436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5fc9ec0af730262f62c41f3cf538515","title":"kim joys recipe for lemon and rose tofu cheesecake","story":"The flavours shine in this simple, creamy cake, which can be made with vegan cream cheese if you preferThis cheesecake is made with tofu, which gives it a nice and creamy texture. It’s a great option if you have silken tofu in your cupboard, but are short on fresh ingredients such as cream. It tastes different to a standard cheesecake as it is less “cheesy”, but I enjoy both. You can always substitute some of the silken tofu for vegan or dairy cream cheese. I enjoy the simplicity of this version, which lets the lemon and rosewater flavours shine.

Meanwhile, make the edible decorations. Cut simple petal shapes from the wafer paper, then use a paintbrush to very lightly wet these. Paint using food dye mixed with a little water. When the wafer paper is wet, you will be able to shape it so that it looks more realistic. For the stem make a long stem shape painted brown. When you’re happy with your petals and stem, leave to dry for a few hours. They will go hard and be easy to pick up.Decorate the fully chilled cheesecake with the petal decorations, then serve and enjoy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short?

Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games.

The two women then did it together, breathing slowly and intentionally in sync.Breathwork is one of the tools that Douthit, 56, often reaches for when soothing clients. But this time, instead of sitting in the same room inhaling the same air, the women breathed together on Zoom.“It’s devastating, right? I mean, you built this relationship, you fall in love with these people, you get excited about working with them, and then suddenly, you can’t,” she told me.As Covid-19 changes the way women experience pregnancy, doulas like Douthit are caught between a calling to guide their clients through childbirth and the limitations caused by the pandemic. Many hospitals across the country now limit visitors to just the mother-to-be and her partner in the delivery room, meaning doulas, who are recognized by hospitals only as visitors, are forced to support births virtually or not at all. Some are organizing and pushing back on hospital policies that exclude them from delivery rooms, but therein lies an ethical question: at what point does advocating for recognition and respect outweigh the risks of exposing others to the virus as non-medical visitors in a hospital? It’s a debate saddled with historical tension between doulas and the western obstetrical healthcare system.For now, doulas are hastily translating their intimate and hands-on work on to impersonal virtual platforms, and preparing their clients for giving birth without them physically present. “We’re trying to scramble to give support in a different way, and learn a new skill set really quickly,” says Raychel Franzen, a New York-based doula. “I think one of the things that a doula brings to their clients is a calm energy. We can still do that with facial expressions on a video call, but the energy exchange is just a little bit different.”Gwynne Knap, an Atlanta-based doula, is also a faculty member of Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (Cappa), one of a few organizations nationwide that certifies doulas. Recently, Knap’s work has revolved around teaching fellow doulas how to shift their offerings to reflect the circumstances – Cappa has developed resources and suggestions for doulas to support their clients virtually, such as having the woman’s partner wear an earbud, the doula coaching through contractions over the phone. But some techniques used by birth workers to calm and comfort women during labor, like hand-holding and eye contact, are impossible to translate. “A labor doula helps the mom a lot with comfort and suggested positions, but she also calms the partner so they can be more emotionally present,” says Knap. “When the doula’s not there, it’s very hard to do that.”While some doulas have shifted to virtual support, others are pushing back against the new hospital policies and argue that hospitals shouldn’t lump doulas in as regular “visitors”, but rather as critical to ensure the mother’s health. These doulas, along with birth advocacy groups, are organizing virtual town halls to strategize a unified pushback, circulating petitions against inidual hospital policies, and distributing scripts for doulas to use when speaking to hospital administrators about the potentially harmful implications of restricting doulas from labor units. In some cases, that advocacy has resulted in hospitals adjusting their visitor policy to allow doulas, in addition to a partner or support person, on the labor floor.“It’s not a bonus or a luxury for someone to have care that is safe and respectful,” says Cristen Pascucci, founder of Birth Monopoly, an online advocacy organization that focuses on birthing rights. They argue that for some patients, doulas are an essential part of ensuring a healthy, safe birth – especially for marginalized populations like women of color, particularly black women, who bear the brunt of the maternal mortality crisis in America. There is evidence that continuous, one-on-one birthing support, particularly from a doula, reduces the risk of dissatisfying or traumatic birth experiences, unplanned C-sections and low Apgar scores – the method physicians use to assess a newborn’s health immediately after birth.“There are people who, I feel comfortable saying, have to have a doula to have a safe birth,” Pascucci says. For women of color and low-income women, who statistically face bias from healthcare workers, and who suffer higher maternal mortality rates and worse birth outcomes as a result, a doula can act as a crucial mediator. Many doulas work closely with their clients to inform them about their rights as patients, and talk through the questions they can ask their providers about interventions before they happen.She adds: “Doulas have been quietly filling in the gaps of the maternity care system for years and years. Now we have a crisis and the same system that doulas have been making up for, the first chance it got, was like, we still don’t know what you do and we still don’t appreciate you. So all of those gaps that doulas were filling are back.”For other nurses working on the frontlines, it’s a tough call. One labor and delivery nurse in New Orleans, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for her job, understands that she can never replace the role of a doula in the delivery room. “Doulas provide an excellent service in that one-on-one care,” she says. “As a nurse, I can’t be in there to get you through every contraction.”Her hospital’s labor and delivery unit, which previously had minimal restrictions on non-patient visitors, now only allows one support person a patient, and only when they’re actively in labor. (A patient kept overnight for blood pressure monitoring, for example, cannot have any visitors.) She has had to field frantic phone calls from women asking for their doula to be allowed in, only to tell them no. “I think it’s thrown a lot of women – this is their plan, and everything has been thrown off,” she says. “I think about how scary that must be.”On the other hand, she works in a city besieged by the virus. Every unit of her hospital, which is full, has been overrun with Covid-19 patients (including some in labor and delivery), and the hospital has run out of personal protective equipment for its staff.“We’re struggling,” she says. “We’re told to reuse our masks. We’re told to wipe down our plastic gowns between uses. It’s a very somber walk into the hospital each day. Because of what I’ve seen, I think the fewer people in the hospital, the better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d76f1b25e03c8380da0d24832a6b15aa54cd0b3a/122_57_558_335/master/558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=672a59e8166a065654ce910a6160e633","title":"true life portraits imaginary nuptials and fantasising sheep","story":"Creativity erupts in spinning lambs and humans conjuring up a stand-in wedding, Instagram NHS gallery and indoor marathonIn these challenging times, joy can be found in the most unusual places. From powerful paintings to curious sheep, here’s a round-up of today’s uplifting stories to brighten your day.Artists create gallery of NHS portraitsInstagram has been flooded with portraits of NHS workers as artists use their skills to pay tribute to those working on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis.The #PortraitsforNHSHeroes project was started on Instagram by Tom Croft, an artist, early in April when he offered a free oil portrait to the first NHS frontline worker to message him.Since then, more than 500 artists have contributed portraits in all shapes and styles.Adrian Hill, an artist in Pontefract, created an oil painting of his wife, Shelley, who works for the Yorkshire ambulance service.Meanwhile Barry Miller created a series of vivid oil paintings depicting NHS workers in scrubs and protective gear, as well as a picture of a police officer.Croft said: “It’s grown quicker than I could have imagined. It’s been amazing. It’s been moving to read all of the messages from NHS key workers about how this is brightening up their day, or at least giving them something positive to look forward to in these incredibly tough and challenging times.“I knew the art community would respond in this way but it’s still wonderful to see it happen in reality.” Croft originally paired up artists with key workers but after a “wonderfully overwhelming” response created a facility for artists to advertise their services and pair up themselves.When the lockdown restrictions are lifted, Croft said, he hoped to hold an exhibition of all the portraits in one place. He is in talks with galleries.Neighbours surprise couple with wedding celebrationA couple in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, who had to postpone their wedding due to the coronavirus outbreak were treated to a surprise from neighbours who created a “big day” for them.Phil Richmond, 27, and Allie Lawton, 25, decorated their lounge with balloons, confetti and fairy lights, while their children Lily, four, and Ben, two, became the attendees along with some soft toys.“As far as we were aware, that was all we were doing on our wedding day,” she said.Then Lawton’s mother said she had left a bottle of champagne at the end of their drive, and when the couple went to retrieve it they found their neighbours dressed up and outside ready to celebrate. A song for the couple’s first dance was played, and the family were showered with confetti as they walked down a makeshift aisle.The window of one house was decorated with an A\u0026ampP sign surrounded by hearts, while a “Just married” sign was corrected to read “Married soon”.“It will be a day that we remember for ever really,” said Richmond.London marathon in a living roomA man in Northern Ireland is planning to run the equivalent of the London marathon in his living room this weekend, after the world-famous event was postponed until October.Col Bignell, 26, a retail worker from County Down, was disappointed at missing his first marathon, but instead will be running the length of his living room thousands of times to cover the miles.Bignell, originally from London, dared his Facebook friends to “give him the push” by giving his post 260 likes. He said he intended to raise money for the NHS with the run.Sheep investigate empty McDonald’s in WalesA flock of sheep were spotted exploring an empty McDonald’s restaurant in Ebbw Vale, Wales.“Even the sheep in Ebbw Vale are having McDonald’s withdrawals,” joked Andrew Thomas, who photographed the animals.Thomas said he came across the curious flock on Saturday afternoon as he left the Aldi store next door where he had been shopping for food for his mother who was isolating.The sheep are not the only animals to have been spotted in unusual places in the lockdown.A group of playful lambs was spotted spinning on a roundabout in a children’s playground in Monmouthshire.“Even though the park is shut it was great to see these lambs enjoying themselves this morning,” said Gareth Williams, owner of the flock kept at Raglan Farm Park. “It would normally be too busy for the lambs to get a chance. Just hope they don’t get too dizzy.”And who could forget the mountain goats of Great Orme who took over the seaside town of Llandudno last month?A famous Banksy work in Bristol has been modified with the addition of a face mask.Girl with a Pierced Eardrum, which appeared in the street artist’s home city in 2014, is a parody of the painting Girl with a Pearl Earring, by Johannes Vermeer.The mural, at Hanover Place, acquired a face mask in a nod to the coronavirus pandemic.Banksy has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e70cebea50acc9ab82989ca1caa26922d91b3f8f/0_43_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f76940d538c58892a04e7fac367e28d","title":"the best in culture under coronavirus lockdown podcast","story":"Three  critics – Ammar Kalia, Laura Snapes and Sian Cain – join Rachel Humphreys with a guide to the best of television, music and books under lockdown.

Bryant then demands to know whether ministers were briefed about the other schemes.Hancock faced further pressure over the protection offered to NHS staff after the European commission said the UK had been given “ample opportunity” to join the EU scheme bulk-buying masks, gowns, gloves and goggles.After a day of confusion in Westminster over the UK’s lack of involvement in the EU’s joint procurement of equipment, a spokesman for the commission appeared to bolster the claim that ministers had taken a “political decision” to opt out.The commission spokesman said UK representatives had been briefed on the EU plans throughout February and March when they could have signed up for the huge purchases of ventilators, laboratory supplies and PPE.UK officials and ministers have repeatedly said the government only failed to take part in the schemes because of a communication problem linked to missed emails.The commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: “The EU commission already announced on 31 January that it could help member states with organisation of such joint procurement schemes and this idea of joint procurement and reporting on the state of the medical supplies of the member states was a recurring topic of the agenda of the health and security committee meetings.“The UK was, as all other members of the health security committee meetings, aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so. As to why it did not participate, this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8951cf41997c7909356bdd35d19976101aaed75/0_95_3854_2313/master/3854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25f20b3ac68774a6f231cbe59a3ba261","title":"referees need supporting too lockdown tests rugby league officials","story":"Officials face a challenge to keep fit and focused in readiness for eventual return but are keeping themselves busy – and usefulWhen the Rugby Football League furloughed its refereeing department shortly after the suspension of the domestic league season last month, its nine full-time officials and numerous support staff suddenly found themselves stood down. While the players’ welfare has been in the spotlight during the pandemic, the men in the middle will be no different but face an arguably more daunting task to be ready when the time comes to start up again.“I guess it’s easy to think these lads aren’t human at times when they’re getting horrendous abuse from the terraces, but they need supporting as much as the players do,” says the RFL’s head of match officials, Steve Ganson.A full-time referee earns considerably less than an average Super League player, but is still subject to a gruelling conditioning to meet the demands of officiating an often relentless sport. Players have been given training schedules and even equipment to keep them in shape, but the referees have far fewer resources at their disposal.“When they get furloughed, it means we can’t send them training programmes,” says Ganson, a former high-profile official. “They’ve got to adapt, use their own initiative and be professional. They know we’re going to need them on form when they come back because it’s going to be chaotic, but I’m confident in the commitment they show that they will return from this strongly.”Some referees have been busier than others during lockdown. Chris Kendall, who officiated the Super League Grand Final last year, has filled his impromptu off-season with running, cycling and, perhaps most importantly, community spirit aplenty in his hometown of Huddersfield.“Myself and my girlfriend have both signed up for the NHS volunteer scheme and our local council are wanting volunteers, too,” he says. “We’ve got some elderly neighbours who we’re delivering food and daily essentials to. I just want to keep people going throughout these difficult times what I’m doing is pretty insignificant compared to the frontline workers.”With rugby league likely to play multiple games each week when the season eventually returns, officials will see their workload doubled, plus there is added mental pressure. “They run around six or seven miles a game on average, but they will have hundreds of rucks and plays to rule over too, plus the abuse and pressure which comes with the territory,” Ganson says.“The mental toll officiating takes on you is enormous. We have a psychologist who works with the full-time officials and he will be crucial to look after their mental wellbeing when we start again. If they’re officiating two or three games a week, we will have to dramatically change our training. There will have to be a welfare programme there for them and we’ll ensure they’re ready.”Kendall agrees there will need to be a considered approach to how referees can cope with the fresh demands placed on them. “We’re the pantomime villains to many but we are trying our best, and we’re under stress out there too. We are going to need a few weeks of pre-season and hopefully people will see we’re having to go through the same level of stress to get ourselves ready to go again.”Coronavirus will bring lasting change to rugby league’s landscape – and it has already had a profound effect on the RFL’s refereeing staff before lockdown Ganson feared he may have contracted the virus, sending the governing body’s headquarters into panic.“We’d been skiing in Lombardy and a few days later my wife wasn’t too well,” he recalls. “My doctor told me to go home from work immediately, and they sent an ambulance crew in hazmat suits for me, my wife and my youngest child on 23 February. I remember it vividly: it was horrendous. Where we’d been, in Lombardy, everyone was going about their business as usual and it was a 36-hour wait before the test came back negative. It was a very nervy couple of days, and because I’d been in work I’d come into contact with a lot of people.”Even now, Ganson’s personal scare acts as a sobering reminder as to how immaterial sport is at present. But the day will arrive when players take to the field again and referees become, as Kendall admits, the pantomime villains all over again. They, just like the players, will need to be supported.“People tell me referees don’t care about their work – that couldn’t be further from the truth,” Ganson insists. “They work in the community all the time, and they’re human beings like the rest of us. Hopefully that’s remembered when we get going again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be8c63a31bcf6a190d1c3029ab6d9520a932d249/0_136_6271_3761/master/6271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9aa0521ace06a7ccb72a3226d53ffd5","title":"lockdown learning 10 great ways to be ready for your next holiday","story":"Discover online courses in languages, cookery and photography (even scuba and sailing) as you prepare for a future adventureDiscover how to capture your next holiday with a pencil or paintbrush through online art tuition.

It’s an in-depth course, in 12 modules, covering many aspects, from tools to making fires (pictured) and building shelters, with videos, worksheets and animations to bring it all to life. Two modules are available on joining, with the rest sent out once a week (from £224). For those on a budget, there’s a lot of free material, from videos and articles to podcasts on the website of Frontier Bushcraft’s Paul Kirtley.The mountains may be out of bounds, but it doesn’t mean skiing skills have to get rusty. The Warren Smith Ski Academy has launched lockdown coaching with live, free Facebook webinars every Friday at 10am (they’re recorded if you miss them). The #skitechniquelab aims to motivate with exercises to help skiers stay slope-fit and maintain muscle strength and flexibility in lockdown. Coaches will offer advice on anything from specific posture issues to equipment, and a video consultation service analysing ski footage will be launched soon. • on Facebook This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Didn’t time fly when we used to have fun?) of The Great British Sewing Bee (BBC One) to distract us from The Great British Balls-Up, The Great British Death Count and The Great British Wasteland of Competence, Political Communication, Professional Responsibility and Crisis Management Expertise.It’s back. Twelve amateur sewers instead of bakers, wowing us with creations made of fabric rather than dough and pastry but still with the same sweet, spirit-lifting powers inherent in the sight of anything beautiful and useful springing to life under the human hand, where none was there before. It even has its own line in puns too, though they tend to centre round unfortunate puckerings and dotted plackets instead of soggy bottoms and nice buns.Also, there’s Patrick Grant. The effortlessly charming designer and director of the Savile Row tailors Norton \u0026amp Sons is the only one of the original presenting lineup who remains. He is there to appraise the contestants’ work, but his bladed elegance is a silent judgment on us all a wordless yet constant reminder of the heights we should always strive to reach even as, mere capering, hairless monkeys before him that we are, we will never reach beyond the foothills. A friend of mine once noted that she kept trying to undress Grant in her mind’s eye, but “it’s just better and better suits all the way down”. Take that, Paul Hollywood with your vulgar handshakes, a man who always looks like he’s dressed in double denim even if he’s not.Fellow judge Esme Young, costume designer for most of the films in which you have adored the costumes and a lecturer at Central Saint Martin’s, is back with her trademark silver bob, glamorous bohemianism and astute veteran’s eye. Joe Lycett is the congenial host and with very little further ado we are off. Three sewing challenges per show, showcasing different skills and – hopefully – allowing everyone a chance to shine somewhere and the viewer to sit at home for a brief but golden hour in which all that matters is a dozen wrap skirts, repurposed shirts (“My father is at home barechested,” says Lycett, “and very confused”) and whether tea dresses hit appropriately below the knee.Like Bake Off, like Kirstie Allsopp’s arts and crafts curations and like the ne plus ultra of restorative programming The Repair Shop (we must talk about this properly sometime, but short version – it repairs your soul), it provides respite and retreat by showing people working hard and taking something seriously that doesn’t matter more than it should.None of the participants is cast in order to raise any hackles or provide grit in the oyster. Everything is designed to shine a little light, to show you what can be done by ordinary people with a special set of skills. Hazel is a charity worker who got into sewing when feeling lost after the birth of her first child. Peter is a hostel manager from Brighton who turns out to be able to channel Vivienne Westwood through the medium of men’s officewear (he wins the repurposed shirts challenge comfortably and the wrap skirt round thanks to his sharp rouleau loop work and top notch topstitching). And Matt’s sideline in making bespoke costumes for his drag queen friends puts him in pole position when it comes to designing a tea dress around a model in five hours flat.The rest of them are smashing too, though I cannot help but feel a little extra fondness for Claire. Who cannot love a vintage clothes enthusiast with her hair in a victory roll, first seen cycling in tweed on a sit-up-and-beg bike through her native Winchester, who says “Blast!” when she drops her scissors and refers to a recalcitrant zip as “a beast”? Commitment is everything.Disasters (mismatched buttons! Pricked fingers and bloodied fabric!) and triumphs (successful rouleau reversals! Perfect pleats!) arise in plentiful but never overwhelming or unfair measure.My preview did not show the winner or loser of the first round. I suspect the former must have been Peter but I’m hoping they just let everyone else stay. No losers during lockdown should be every programme maker’s motto. Just edit them back in like they did the late Oliver Reed in Gladiator and continue to add to whatever gaiety the nation can still muster. You know it makes sense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6efa3b5afc190bf198cd56660872372d591fbc90/0_0_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4136ce3a264c5c13197e09de22d97a70","title":"california coronavirus testing bolinas","story":"Bolinas, north of San Francisco, aims to be the first US town to achieve the feat as it seeks to learn more about transmissionA small town in northern California is working to become the first in the US to have every community member tested for coronavirus. Researchers hope the endeavor will help clarify how Covid-19 spreads through communities, and how immunity is built.Bolinas, an unincorporated, rural enclave of 1,600, nestled right above San Francisco and bordered by the ocean on three sides, drew upon its residents’ personal resources to launch the effort.The town raised $300,000 through GoFundMe to buy testing equipment and tents. Two residents – the venture capitalist Jyri Engeström and pharmaceutical executive Cyrus Harmon – used their connections to reach researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and invited them to set up a study in their town. Local volunteers set up a website where people could register and helped source masks, face shields and other protective equipment for medical workers. Local not-for-profit organizations offered to help spread the word to homebound older residents and unhoused community members.The results from the Bolinas study, in addition to a similar testing program in San Francisco’s economically and ethnically erse Mission District, will help researchers understand how the virus spreads through rural and urban communities, said Dr Aenor Sawyer, a Bolinas resident and UCSF orthopedic surgeon who is coordinating testing in the small town, about the project.What is the benefit of testing every single person?Over and over, we see people saying that they’re ready to lift the distancing restrictions and open everything back up, but it’s actually reckless to begin lifting before we have any information – or enough information – about how the virus moves through a community. We can’t safely start returning to normal life until we learn more about the transmission of the virus, until we learn about the development of antibodies – the extent to which they give us immunity, and for how long. Community-wide testing is really what we need in order to answer some of those questions.Why is it important to do two types of testing?We’re trying to encourage everybody to get two types of tests – the PCR test, which will look for the presence of a viral infection, and the serological tests or blood tests, which will look for the presence of antibodies.If someone has a positive result from the PCR test, we’ll call them right away, so they can take steps to keep themselves safe, and isolate themselves so they keep their loved ones safe. If someone isn’t able to isolate themselves, we’ll get them a room in a hotel.The antibody testing is important because there’s a lot we don’t know about antibody tests. We don’t know which test is best in class, and beyond that we don’t know once you get the results, what that actually means. If you have the antibodies that your body produces in the early stages of the infection, you could actually still be infected and pass the virus along to others. Another type of antibody may indicate you’ve had the infection and fought it off, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re fully immune – we don’t know how long immunity lasts.So we need a lot more information on antibody tests, and the way to get that information is to do a lot more antibody tests. Since these are blood tests, we can also run several types of antibody tests on the same blood sample to compare and validate the results of different tests.How is it going so far?We’ve set up a drive-thru testing site for most residents. For homebound elders with chronic conditions or people with limited mobility, we’ve partnered with a local non-profit to send medical staff to people’s residences to conduct the tests. We made sure to reach out to our homeless population and people living in their cars.It’s been extraordinary – we tested 487 people just on Tuesday.The testing in Bolinas is not mandatory. We’re trying to take down any barriers to that end, making the testing free and accessible to everyone.There was a delightful moment at the drive-thru testing site where I turned around and saw a car in the first slot, a man with his bicycle about 20ft back, and a young guy on his skateboard another 20ft back. Every mode of transportation is acceptable – everyone is welcome.How will the project in Bolinas relate to the one in San Francisco’s Mission District, where a community organizer has similarly galvanized an effort to try to test everyone in the neighborhood?What’s really different is that the Mission District is not as isolated geographically as Bolinas. There are no borders around the Mission, there’s no geographic separation across San Francisco’s main thoroughfares distinguishing one neighborhood from another. So it’ll be really interesting to see how different or similar the viral transmission is in the Mission versus in Bolinas.The main thing is, we just need more community-wide testing across the board. We’re hoping we can demonstrate a model for widespread testing in the Mission and Bolinas to help other cities and communities do the same.Some communities have complained that they’re unable to access the swabs, test kits and personal protective equipment, let alone the funding, they need  to ramp up testing. How did you manage in Bolinas?Well, first and foremost, we didn’t want to take away supplies from anyone else in order to conduct this research. We’re working really hard on making sure that we aren’t taking supplies from the frontlines of healthcare. So we’ve gotten creative.We sourced our masks from paint shops and hardware stores. The most in-demand swabs they use at hospitals are medical centers are these long ones with a score – which are long enough so they allow medical personnel to take a sample without having to touch patients, but can easily be broken in half so they fit inside these test tubes. Those are hard to come by, so we developed a technique to use different types of swabs that we break and that can work just as well. UCSF also developed their own testing kits, which we are able to use in Bolinas.In terms of processing the tests, that’s been a challenge in California as well. There’s been bottlenecks and delays. Luckily, UCSF has an enormous capacity, so they’re able to process all their tests in-house and they’re able to help other counties process tests – and we’re able to take advantage of that.I do think it’s important to not rely on the community to always come up with the initiative and money. We need a state fund to help local leaders do this for every community up and down the state."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2703eda6c4eb79ac8c11ea9b07ca2183","title":"coronavirus what is eu medical equipment scheme why did uk opt out","story":"British government is facing criticism for not taking part in joint purchase of supplies amid the coronavirus pandemicThe British government is coming under fire for failing to join the EU’s procurement scheme for medical equipment, including masks, gloves, goggles, gowns, testing kits and ventilators, at a time when NHS health workers across the country are crying out for more supplies. In the latest twist, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was forced to deny claims, later retracted, by the government’s senior diplomat that it had been a “political decision” to opt out of the scheme.The British government signed the EU’s joint procurement agreement in 2014 after the H1N1 pandemic had highlighted weaknesses in the access and purchasing power of EU countries to obtain pandemic vaccines and medicines.Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the government has the right to take part until 31 December 2020. The purpose of the scheme is to allow participants to act together as a big block purchaser, securing the best prices and forcing the way to the front of the queue at a time of shortage.Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the EU has launched four calls for tender for medical equipment and supplies. It invited companies to supply gloves and surgical gowns on 28 February, personal protective equipment (PPE) for eye and respiratory protection on 15 March and medical ventilators and respiratory equipment on the same day. A final call to companies to supply laboratory equipment, including testing kits, was made on 19 March. The total value of PPE being purchased is about €1.5bn (£1.3bn). The EU ceiling for purchases of ventilators is €790m. The first call for tender of PPE on 28 February failed because of a lack of suitable suppliers. It was relaunched on 12 March. Since then all four calls for tender have successfully found companies willing to supply the goods to the scale and quality required. The timeline for delivery varies. Some of the PPE is expected imminently. There is a longer time-frame for deliveries of ventilators with the EU warning member states that it could take as long as a year for the all the machines to arrive.When it emerged last month that the UK was not involved in the EU’s bulk purchase of ventilators despite being aware of its existence and purpose, a Downing Street spokesman said the UK had not joined as the country was “not in the EU”. That line changed within 24 hours and a communications error was blamed. An email from the European commission inviting the UK to join had been sent to an out-of-date and defunct address. When the  reported last week that there had been multiple opportunities to be involved with the purchase of PPE, as well as ventilators, further details had emerged of the communications error. The UK, it was said, had only received an invitation to sit on the the EU’s joint procurement agreement steering group on the 19 March. By then all four of the procurements had been organised.The Foreign Office’s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, flatly contradicted the explanation of the UK’s opt-out during an appearance in front of a House of Commons select committee. “It was a political decision,” McDonald said. “The UK mission in Brussels briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is known.” The comments raised concerns that Brexit ideology had been put before the practicalities of saving lives.Within an hour, Hancock denied the decision had been politically motivated”. Shortly afterwards, McDonald issued a formal correction in a letter to the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat. “Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken whether or not to participate,” McDonald wrote.Hancock and Helen Whately, the care minister, pointed out on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning that the EU’s scheme has yet to deliver any medical supplies. It has also been suggested by anonymous government officials to various media outlets that the UK is now part of a procurement of therapeutics and products required for vaccines.In reality, no such new procurements have yet been launched. As for the ongoing procurements, eight suppliers have offered PPE products in excess of that being ordered by the participating member states, and deliveries are expected to European healthcare workers shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddac790ae769d992a1212ced7dcf3a6dd3610da1/0_258_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb2004fc15d904fae7eab11de5a27d3c","title":"europe had hottest year on record in 2019 new report shows","story":"Findings confirm 11 of the 12 warmest years in Europe occurred in past two decadesEurope had its hottest year on record last year, new data has confirmed, with periods of exceptional heat last February, June and July, and one of the wettest Novembers on record.Previous records were broken by only a small margin, but the findings confirmed that 11 out of the 12 warmest years in Europe have occurred in the past two decades, according to the European State of the Climate 2019 report, published on Wednesday.There was drought in central Europe over the summer, but at the end of 2019 four times the normal amount of rain fell in western and southern Europe.A heatwave in Greenland last year brought record levels of surface melting, the report found, though the European Arctic was slightly colder across the year than in some other recent years, with the lowest average since 2010. Europe’s glaciers have lost an average of 16 tonnes of fresh water per square metre since 1997.Summer temperatures in parts of Europe were as much as 3C to 4C higher than normal in 2019, the report said, with heatwaves in June and July breaking records in France and Germany.The data confirms other findings that show a clearly warming trend globally. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also produced its final report for 2019, confirming that last year was globally the second hottest on record, with the oceans reaching the highest temperatures ever recorded.Wednesday marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency.But the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a “a collective call for transformative action for our planet”.Among the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.On Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, the 350.org campaign group together with the Stop the Money Pipeline will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the WMO, said that although the coronavirus crisis would probably result in a temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions, it would also make it harder to help people afflicted by the impact of climate breakdown. He warned that ignoring the climate crisis would have a greater impact than the pandemic.“Whilst Covid-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human wellbeing, ecosystems and economies for centuries,” he said. “We need to flatten both the pandemic and climate change curves. We need to show the same determination and unity against climate change as against Covid-19. We need to act together in the interests of the health and welfare of humanity, not just for the coming weeks and months but for many generations ahead.”Globally, the past five-year mean temperatures were 1.1C above pre-industrial levels, taking the world closer to the 2C threshold, beyond which scientists say climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. All countries are bound by the Paris agreement to hold global heating rises to no more than 2C, though the US is withdrawing from the accord.Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which compiled the European State of the Climate 2019 report, on behalf of the European Commission, said: “One exceptional warm year does not constitute a warming trend, but with detailed information from our operational services, that covers many different aspects of our climate, we are able to connect the dots to learn more about how it is changing.” The reports were published to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which is being celebrated online around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1227033eb8be51922cb8fbaa648655ae4238ba4/0_71_2656_1594/master/2656.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7015cfae64bbed5bcb9897f14be95d2b","title":"revealed private firm running uk ppe stockpile was sold in middle of pandemic","story":"Movianto was also involved in legal disputes with firm that built warehouse to store equipmentThe warehouse appears unremarkable, except for its size. Just off a motorway on an industrial estate in Merseyside sits a 35,000 sq m (377,000 sq ft) purpose-built warehouse with 20 loading docks to enable the storage and rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of face masks, aprons, gowns, gloves and body bags.For security reasons, the  has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK’s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic–size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast, climate-controlled warehouse.However, the  can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company, Movianto, which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (£107m) by its owner, a large US healthcare group.The fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic, months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply, would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside.The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to “lock the gates” and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock.Morley’s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was “a much bigger story that needs to be told” about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details.For its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley’s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months.“Movianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,” the firm said.But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government’s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German–owned multinational to an American one.In the coming months the custody of the UK’s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: “The pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.”Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government’s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been “one of distribution rather than one of supply”. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme.That stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated £500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature–controlled conditions.The government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens \u0026amp Minor, won the £55m deal in the summer of 2018.As part of Movianto’s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley.Movianto’s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was “made by executives no longer associated with Movianto”.A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain “a ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event”.In early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley’s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became “uncooperative”. “This went on for weeks,” he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent “in accordance with the terms of the lease”.Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which “kept going on the blink” resulting, he alleges, in “temperature spikes”.A Movianto source said Morley’s account was inaccurate. In a statement, Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of “Morley’s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations”.By his own account, Morley’s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. “It got to the point where I said I’m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.” When that happened, Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse.Movianto said the injunction was required as “a result of Morley’s conduct and repeated threats to interfere with Movianto’s operations”. It said Morley’s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by “various court proceedings” that ruled in Movianto’s favour. In July 2019, under the control of administrators, Morley’s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto.Morley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto – and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January, he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank’s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a £75m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the “borrowed personal wealth” to spend on “South African mining investments, property, cars, a yacht and a jet”.Morley told the  his lifestyle was the result of hard work and “had nothing to do with being a good landlord”. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto, which came to a head in May 2019.As works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley, Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm “failed to comply” with the conditions of a £61m loan facility.Morley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in. According to the administrator’s report, the legal dispute “caused delays to the construction works” at the new warehouse, which were finally completed in July 2019. Movianto said the legal disputes “have had no impact on Movianto’s work in response to Covid-19”.According to a government source, the transfer of the UK’s emergency PPE supplies to the new warehouse was completed by the end of August 2019, four months before the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in China.The warehouse is now owned by Warrington council, which bought the property for £45m in October. During a change of shifts on Tuesday afternoon, warehouse workers were seen having their car boots searched as they left.In the coming months, their employer will switch from Owens \u0026amp Minor to the French company EHDH Holding Group, under a deal agreed on 6 April. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of June, with demand for supplies in the UK’s pandemic stockpile expected to continue for many months.The distribution of that stockpile’s PPE, it seems, may no longer solely be the responsibility of Movianto. Eleven days ago, the DHSC announced a new “247 military operation” to oversee the supply of PPE to health and care workers. “We’ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch,” Hancock said.A government source said the coronavirus outbreak presented different requirements to a flu pandemic – the basis of Movianto’s original contract. Movianto was now “supporting” the government’s PPE plan through its contractual obligations, the source said. Movianto said the terms of its NHS contracts were “confidential”.Jeff Jochims, the chief operating officer of Owens \u0026amp Minor, said: “We look forward to closing the sale of Movianto business to EHDH, but in the meantime will continue our ceaseless work to support the global response to this pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b1255f79dcb86fa1ee2b11eeee3504a29317efa/54_362_642_384/master/642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=451ebaf1d000292b0dced2f03785b550","title":"what is happening is not normal we 100 need answers this is not adding up","story":"Zia Wassan says there is a feeling of vulnerability in BAME communities like his and more needs to be done prevent deathsFor Zia Wassan there is the devastating grief of losing his father - his protector and anchor in life. But underneath that grief, that sense of undeniable loss, there is something else – a feeling that things could have turned out differently.“My dad went before his time, he shouldn’t have died,” says the 35-year-old. Zia’s father, Choudhary Aslam Wassan, 67, a popular and charismatic former food business pioneer and political campaigner from Birmingham, died from coronavirus last month. His son says the disease has also claimed the lives of at least 10 of his father’s friends – middle-aged Asian men with underlying health conditions – in recent weeks.For Zia, this statistic and the untimely deaths of his father and his friends are not only shocking but require in-depth investigation. He says there is a distinct feeling of vulnerability in communities like his – inner-city, historically impoverished areas with high levels of health issues, and more needs to be done within these communities to stop the transmission and subsequent deaths from the disease. “It just doesn’t make sense. We need to know why they are not coming back from hospital. My dad definitely went before his time and I’d say a good 10 of his friends have all died in a similar way. They had underlying health problems, got a fever, ended up in hospital and then didn’t come back.” Wassan, a great-grandfather, first started displaying symptoms of the disease on 20 March. Before lockdown he had been travelling around the country, including attending a funeral.“He first just got a cough and was told to self-isolate. He was in good health but was a type-2 diabetic so we were hoping he would be given antibiotics, but the GP decided not to,” said Zia.“He carried on following the rules but then his cough started to get worse and he had a fever. He was worse and then we called an ambulance. Within two hours of getting to hospital they had taken him away to intensive care. Nobody could see him or be with him.“Then later, he phoned me and said he was being told that he wasn’t getting better and they would need to put him to sleep and on to a ventilator – that’s the last time I spoke with him. He told me to look after my mum and the family: ‘Take care of yourself, and I will see you in three days,’ but that was the end.” Wassan would never return to his home in the Handsworth area of Birmingham. His ventilator was switched off after he showed no signs of recovering. He died in the City hospital on 29 March.Zia’s mother, Tanvir, was herself briefly hospitalised with symptoms of the virus, while other members of the family have also been ill. They are all now recovering at home with Zia currently in self-isolation.Zia said: “When he first started showing symptoms he asked his GP for antibiotics but he wasn’t given any. I don’t understand this because he was in a high-risk category. This must be happening to lots of other Asian families too. They need to be treated with more care if it is emerging that they are at higher risk, surely.”The Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood, who had known Wassan for around 30 years, backed calls for an investigation into the disproportionate number of deaths in BAME communities. Mahmood, who has previously said older Muslim and Sikh people in the area were struggling to adhere to government guidelines surrounding physical distancing, said some communities would bear the brunt of the disease.“What we are seeing play out here is the result of years of austerity cuts within NHS services in these poor, deprived areas like Handsworth and Lozells. Where historically these communities have not been supported and which has now made them devastatingly vulnerable to this disease. It is an absolute disaster, we need to protect these people,” he added.Wassan, came to Birmingham from Pakistan in the 1970s, aged 21, with his brother Ashraf Wassan, and devoted his life to the city. He championed Labour activists in the city, including Mahmood, now MP for Perry Barr, and Waseem Zaffar, now cabinet member for transport and the environment for Birmingham city council.He is survived by his wife and six children Zia, Waheed, Saeed, Rukiya, Sadia and Shazia. A seventh child, Naveed, died in 2009. Nephews Jawaad, Zahid and Shahid Ashraf are among a large extended family. He was a grandfather of 23 children and has one great grandchild."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4d63b5f5370b31b954d037f434ace41df8b2b57/0_2_5245_3147/master/5245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb6b2ffdefb908610f25349f77c90ed","title":"why are people from bame groups dying disproportionately of covid 19","story":"Co-morbidities, demographics and societal imbalances all play a part, says UCL professor Nishi ChaturvediCo-morbidities could certainly play a role. The black population, where the discrepancy appears to be greatest, is particularly afflicted with hypertension. Diabetes is three-fold higher in this ethnic group. Both of those conditions will increase your risk of death once you’ve got Covid. The added problem is that these conditions occur at a younger age in people of black descent. However, in mitigation against that, certainly older people of black African descent don’t smoke as much, so have less respiratory disease, have lower rates of cancers and coronary disease. With Asian populations, the story is a bit different, but again there is a four-fold excess in diabetes and blood pressure rises higher with age in South Asians compared to Europeans.Genetics sounds like an easy get-out clause, but it isn’t. Ethnicity is a complex socio-cultural construct, it’s not a biology construct. There’s no gene for being Asian. There’s no gene for being black. People of ethnic group membership can change over time and with age, it’s not an immutable thing and it very poorly maps on to any biology you can think of. People have looked to see if there’s a genetic explanation for these ethnic differences in chronic disease and have been unable to find one, despite having looked quite hard in large numbers. So there’s no evidence that genes explain the excess risk of Covid susceptibility. It’s important to put a nail in that one because it feels as if we can abdicate any responsibility for sorting this out and this really isn’t the case.Ethnic minorities are over-represented in high-risk occupations, including health workers, in the transport sector and essential shop work. Clearly, there’s a huge amount of heterogeneity, but overall ethnic minorities are more likely to live in deprived, dense, over-crowded urban areas and are more likely to be disadvantaged. In some cases, household composition could play a role, particularly in Asian households where you have multi-generational households living together.So both through occupation and residential reasons, they’re less able to socially isolate effectively and much more likely to be exposed to high doses of the virus. There’s some suggestion that the greater the dose you’re exposed to the more likely the disease is to prove fatal. That’s perhaps one reason why even quite young healthcare workers are succumbing to the disease.The evidence on ethnic differences in healthcare seeking behaviour is quite messy, and we need to remember that these are quite heterogeneous groups. For instance, people of black ancestry have been found to be less likely to consult for chronic diseases like diabetes, but that doesn’t mean to say that if it’s an acute condition they won’t come forward. One study of people accessing antiviral flu treatments in the flu pandemic of 2009 found that ethnic minorities were less likely to ask and less likely to collect these. But whether this was due to reluctance, differences in access to healthcare, the way the message was put across or racism – it is difficult to pick apart because the healthcare seeking process is so complicated.Ultimately, this is about health inequalities, about deprivation and affluence and how important socio-economic status is in determining health outcomes. This isn’t just an ethnicity story, it affects all of us. Britain has a long history of health inequalities. It’s critically important to understand and I’m relieved that the government is taking this seriously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbe1f950ed12fee89173fe1355a297e53a150388/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4378e22740e47c17d9100470a34de9a","title":"see how coronavirus can spread through a population and how countries flatten the curve","story":"One important characteristic of viruses and other pathogens is how contagious they are.This is measured in a few ways. One key measure is the R0, or basic reproduction number, which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates.For an R0 of three we would expect each new case of a disease to produce three other infections.This is not just a measure of the inherent infectiousness of a disease. It also depends on other factors, including the rate of contact within a population and the duration of the infectious period. It\u0027s a situation-dependent value, so in one city the R0 might be higher and in another lower. It also assumes that the entire population is susceptible to the disease.So what does that look like, and how does it compare with other diseases?How does Covid-19 compare with other diseases?Here, you can see the same spread patterns generated based on the R0 for a range of pathogens in a range of situations, ranging from Spanish flu to the highly contagious measles, for which R0 has been estimated to range between 12 and 18.But the R0 is not the only important number. The effective reproduction number, R, is a value that takes into account the susceptibility of the population.Here, you can set the thresholds for different values and see the result using our simplified model. The reality of pandemics is far more complex but this does demonstrate the basic concepts underlying the spread of diseases. This model uses a hypothetical population of 1,000 people to better visualise the proportion of infections and deaths, and assumes that every person can come into contact with every other person in the population.Choose a case study or use the sliders to see a scenario play outThe isolation value is not used for most of the case studies as isolation data is not usually available.R0 references for other diseases: Sars, Spanish flu, Chickenpox."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bbab8916099c1db3ca7610596ac9d057896bb31/0_194_5870_3524/master/5870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=098e71ea152389644e35e176e5c760c0","title":"animals roaming streets coronavirus lockdown photos","story":"Animals have started taking advantage of cities as they enter lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.

But in the meantime you can continue to follow the ’s coverage of the worldwide picture over on the global live blog.Dominic Raab was chairing that press conference, but in news terms it was dominated by Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser. Here are the main points from what he said, with some analysis.But there is a long path between having a vaccine that’s proof of concept, and until we have either a vaccine or a drug ... what we will have available to us are social measures.We cannot allow R, the force of transmission, to go above one for any extended period at any point because, if it does, exponential growth of this will continue, it’ll resume and we will get back to a situation where the NHS could have its emergency services overwhelmed. It does not take very long from where you get from bad numbers to really bad numbers ...What we are trying to work out is what are the things that add up to an R of less than one. That narrows our options quite significantly.This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear so we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally for the foreseeable future.Ministers who foresee economic disaster if the lockdown continues believe the NHS has a cushion that can be exploited. “The debate is now between people who think we should suppress the virus completely and those who think we should run things quite hot, use the spare capacity in the NHS and aim to keep the R number just below one,” one official said.Another senior insider said: “You have to be clear. Running hot means more people are likely to die. That’s the decision the prime minister will have to take.”The numbers that have been ascribed to Covid directly in ONS statistics are still relatively modest. I have said repeatedly, the fact that the ONS said in their last weekly report, 826 deaths, every one of them a tragedy, but I think that could be an underestimate. What we need to look at, in these data and other data, if we want to get a true picture, is - and I’ve said this right from the beginning - is the all-cause, seasonally adjusted mortality over time. And that is because, as I’ve said here before, deaths from Covid will be a combination of direct deaths from the virus, and also indirect deaths, if for example people are nervous about going into hospital. It is important for people to fully understand that ... even in those countries which started their epidemic curve earlier than in the UK, and which are still ahead, the downward slope from the point which we change is a relatively slow one.We should anticipate the same situation in the UK. We should not expect this to be a sudden fall away of cases.The most striking thing from that press conference was what Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, said about the so-called “exit strategy” from the lockdown. Downing Street has reportedly banned the use of the term “exit strategy” from its planning. That is because it is getting harder to see how there will be any firm exit from some aspects of social distancing for quite a long time to come. Officials, and to a lesser extent ministers, have been signalling it for a while, but Whitty was this afternoon more explicit than anyone else has been about this at these press conferences.Here are his key quotes on this point.We have to be very realistic if people are hoping it’s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectationWe are going to have to do a lot of things for really quite a long period of time, the question is what is the best package and this is what we’re trying to work out.If you release more on one area, you have to keep on board more of another area so there’s a proper trade-off and this is what ministers are having to consider.Later he was even more explicit.In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally. A vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed ... or, andor, highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people.Until we have those, and the probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small and I think we should be realistic about that.We’re going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive as everyone is finding at the moment.But until that point, that is what we will have to do but it will be the best combination that maximises the outlooks but it’s going to take a long time and I think we need to be aware of that.I will post a full summary from the press conference soon.The increase in confirmed cases of Covid-19 in prisons in England and Wales appears to have slowed, daily figures have shown.At least 15 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died. The figures reflect the total number of recorded positive cases of Covid-19 and include iniduals who have recovered. The Prison Service is to temporarily release up to 4,000 inmates who are within two months of their release date, as well as build 500 cells within the existing prison estate to increase single-cell occupancy.Nicola Sturgeon said she was increasingly optimistic Scotland has passed the peak in cases after “really encouraging” data showed a continuing fall in hospital admissions and intensive care cases.The number of intensive care patients in Scotland fell for the seventh day running to 155, the lowest number since 1 April. Covid-19 hospital admissions by ambulance fell to 156 on Tuesday, the lowest level since 18 March, down from a peak of 363 on 6 April. Sturgeon said:These figures for hospital admissions and admissions to intensive care are really encouraging and they’re cause for optimism – still cautious optimism – but optimism nevertheless. The first minister warned, however, it was too early to start relaxing the strict lockdown and social isolation rules. The progress is definitely there but it’s fragile at this stage, so any easing up that will very quickly send all of that into reverse. After disclosing 77 further deaths were recorded in hospitals over the last 24 hours, taking Scotland’s hospitals fatalities total to 1,062, Sturgeon said she believed the number of fatalities would start to fall “very soon”.The National Records of Scotland said 1,616 people had died from confirmed or suspected Covid-19 by Sunday in hospitals or in the community since the start of the outbreak.Opposition parties said those figures raised challenging questions about whether enough had been done to prevent the virus overwhelming care homes. Residents’ families claim in some cases GPs have refused to send ill patients to hospital or refused to visit care homes.Sturgeon and Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, said extra emergency measures were being introduced, including extra deliveries of gowns and masks, and setting up an NHS rapid reaction unit.But they said care homes had been told in March to introduce strict isolation and shielding protocols for their residents, and it was the homes’ responsibility to ensure staff were properly trained and equipped.Pharmacists have voiced growing concerns about contracting Covid-19 at work due to lack of PPE and difficulties maintaining physical distancing.Some said vital community dispensaries may be forced to close if the risk of infection became too great, and that more than “warm words” were needed to keep staff safe.The RPS said there should be “no compromise” when it came to the safety of its staff.Ash Soni, who owns Copes pharmacy in Streatham, south-west London, told the PA news agency he had been forced to pay for PPE supplies personally and questioned why he was not considered “front-line enough” to be given access to sufficient equipment.Others warned that if dispensaries were forced to close, entire communities could lose out. Raj Matharu, a locum pharmacist in Bexleyheath, south-east London, told PA that local pharmacies needed to remain open as they were in the “unique position” to serve deprived communities.And Ade Williams, a pharmacist in Bristol, told PA local people had donated masks and gloves in a show of support to staff putting themselves at risk. He said:You’re trying to do your best and in the back of your mind you’re thinking ‘I feel very vulnerable doing this. Pharmacy teams are essential in the battle against this pandemic and patients are depending on us more than ever. Teams must be safeguarded if pharmacy services are going to be able to continue to function.It is essential the government steps up and provides sufficient PPE to enable pharmacists to face the realities of working in a pharmacy during the pandemic.There were bound to be some teething problems when it came to realising parliament via Zoom – and who better than senior politicians to demonstrate how not to do it. During a virtual plenary session with up to 28 Assembly Members, the Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething made a major boo-boo when he forgot his microphone was on and launched into a rant about fellow Labour AM Jenny Rathbone. Gething dropped a certain four-letter word as he criticised his colleague, who had asked a question after his finishing statement. The Llywydd, Elin Jones, swiftly weighed in: I think the Vaughan Gething needs to turn his microphone off. Vaughan Gething needs to turn his microphone off.The meeting had to be paused after the incident.The reactions speak for themselves.The blooper called into question Gething’s professionalism and Plaid Cymru called for the minister to resign claiming he does not have the “right attitude, skills or temperament”.Writing of his feeling “obviously embarrassed” over the incident later on Twitter, the minister said he had reached out to Rathbone to apologise. Q: Could the lockdown measures be lifted early in somewhere like Bristol?Raab says it would be counter-productive, or dangerous, if the government eased up on the restrictions too early.Q: Matt Hancock says the UK has reached the peak. Does that cover places like Bristol, where cases are lower? Or will it peak later? And will its Nightingale hospital still be needed?Whitty says the south-west has has probably the least impact from Covid. That applies to care homes too, he says.But he says this is not the natural peak of an epidemic without the government doing anything.It is a peak generated by the lockdown. So it is an artificial peak. He says this means you would expect the peak to hit everywhere at about the same time.On the Nightingale hospitals, he says that has created new capacity. That means the government has more options as it plans ahead. The NHS is going to be under pressure from Covid “for really quite a long period of time”, he says.Q: Will you rely on this new app for contact tracing? Or are you going to use other techniques too?Raab says two things will help the government as it moves to the next phase: getting the infection level down, and testing with contact tracing.Whitty says they will be doing a lot more population testing, so that they find out at the earliest point if the R is heading above 1 in any part of the country.Q: What about people who do not have a smartphone, or do not want to use the app?Raab says the public would expect the government to innovate.Whitty says he is very hopeful that they get vaccines with “proof of concept” well within a year.But there is a long way to go between having a vaccine, or a drug, and widespread immunity, he suggests.That is why social distancing measures are so vital, he says.Whitty says, until a vaccine is available, the government will have to rely on social distancing measures.Raab rules out publishing the findings of the government exercise a few years ago that modelled a pandemic of this sort.Q: Sage have looked again at masks, and we are told that wearing maks would be a good idea for people who are asymptomatic. What is your advice to people going out tomorrow?Raab says Sage always looks at the evolving evidence. He says it has not come back with new advice yet. When it does, the government will look at it.Q: What work are you doing on lifting the restrictions, and avoiding a second peak?Whitty says the government cannot allow the R, the reproduction number, to go above 1 for any sustained period of time. That would lead to exponential growth. And it would not be long before you moved from “bad numbers to really bad numbers”, with the NHS at risk of being overwhelmed.He says this disease will not be eradicated. So it will be with us for the foreseeable future.He says it is “wholly unrealistic” to think that the restrictions will be largely relaxed any time soon.The government will have to maintain a lot of measures for a long period of time, he says.Q: Does R have to go well beyond 1, or just slightly below 1?Whitty says getting it below 1 is essential,But there are other ways in which coronavirus could harm people’s health.What optimises outcomes for one group (ie, those who die directly) might not optimise it for those in other groups (ie, those who might die because other health procedures are being affected).Whitty says the government does not yet have an antibody test that is as good as they want. This is critical. He is hoping they will soon have a test that wil give them a “ranging shot” as to what proportion of people, of different ages and in different parts of the country, have had the virus.Q: Are you underusing the MoD?Raab says the government is always considering what more can be done. It has to deploy resources where they are most useful.Carter says the MoD has deployed all the personnel it needs to deploy.Q: Will the armed forces be more involved in drive-through centres?Carter says the armed forces are trying to design the right sort of testing model. That is why they have tried mobile “pop-ups”. Some really good people are working on this.Q: When will PPE shortages be resolved. A day? A week? Or can’t you say?Whitty says he is not an international procurement expert. So he is saying what he is told, he says. He says the NHS has been “tight” for different items at different times.At a national level we are not under water for anything, that I am aware of.But there may be “local issues”, he says.To promise that in two or three days this would all be sorted would be a mistake, he says. He says the government is trying to manage this as best it can.Q: Matt Hancock said we have reached the peak. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Will some measures be eased on 7 May?Raab says there is light at the end of the tunnel. But we are not there yet. We are at the peak, he says.Q: The Irish PM has said he will give the Irish people at least a roadmap for exiting the lockdown. Can’t you at least give people some idea of what is planned?Raab says he has set out the five tests for easing the lockdown. The government needs more data, he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4235274.1587572355!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister urges schools to hold off cancelling junior cycle exams","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Minister for Education Joe McHugh has asked schools to hold off cancelling Junior Cycle tests due next September until discussions take place with representatives of students, parents and schools.

Photograph: iStockMinister for Education Joe McHugh has asked schools to hold off cancelling Junior Cycle tests due next September until discussions take place with representatives of students, parents and schools.Earlier this month Mr McHugh announced that Junior Cycle exams for up to 60,000 students would be replaced with school-based tests in the new academic year.However, a number of secondary schools say this move will create unnecessary anxiety and stress among students. Instead, they are pressing ahead with their own exams and assessments between now and May.Presentation Secondary School in Kilkenny announced on Wednesday that it is going ahead with its own exams for its Junior Cycle students.Principal Shane Hallahan said the school was taking the move to avoid students being placed under “extreme pressure” over the summer.“The current circumstances are difficult and stressful for students especially being separated from their peers as they try to prepare. I think we have to be conscious that so many young people have worked so hard for this,” he said.The school’s move mirrors that of Coláiste Bhaile Chláir in Co Galway, which announced on Monday that its Junior Cycle students will sit exams set by their own teachers during May.Both schools plan to add these grades to the full marks awarded for the oral exams.The lack of detailed guidance over plans for Junior Cycle exams has sparked criticism of the Department of Education and Mr McHugh by students, schools and Opposition parties.However, a spokesman for the Department of Education said it was working with stakeholders in relation to details over the Junior Cycle exams and linked classroom-based assessments, assessment tasks and project work. “The Minister believes that it would be preferable that those discussions are concluded before schools consider their assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle students in 2020,” the spokesman said.This group is due to meet on a number of occasions and it is understood that official guidance may not be issued for another week or more.Ultimately, schools are likely to have the freedom to decide what forms or exams or assessments best meet the needs of their students given that the Junior Cycle will not be a State-certified exam this year.The group is understood to be working on guidelines for schools to follow in holding exams for students and what kind of materials could be shared across schools.Meanwhile, Mr McHugh announced a special euro10 million fund for schools to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged exam students and other pupils.Critics have said that a “digital ide” over access to devices and broadband will impact heavily on the least well-off students.In response, the Minister said the euro10 million fund will allow students have access to devices.In addition, he said the Government is working with telecoms companies to make a number of relevant websites “zero rated”. This would allow students to access these sites with no data costs.In relation to buying devices, Mr McHugh said schools are being asked to prioritise exam classes, and then to look at where else access to technology is most needed.“ I am confident this will make a real difference to thousands of students and provide the technology they need to be able to access online supports,” he said,The Department of Education is due to send a circular to schools shortly, providing the details governing the funding for the grant and the top-up funding.Fianna Fail’s education spokesman Thomas Byrne TD welcomed the move but said it was unfortunate students “have had to wait almost six weeks for much needed ICT equipment”.“We know from a recent National Parents Council post primary that one in five children do not have access to quality broadband, so further action is required to get these students connected,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4235411.1587582907!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state exams q a what is happening with the leaving cert and junior cycle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh is likely to formally announce that the Leaving Cert will begin on Wednesday, July 29th.When will the Leaving Cert begin, exactly? Minister for Education Joe McHugh is likely to formally announce that it will begin on Wednesday, July 29th. He said in an interview this week that he is keen for it to start mid-way through a week - as is tradition - so students don’t face five exams in a row.Why is it going to take so long to get a timetable for the exams ? The official position is that a timetable won’t be available until early June. This, says Mr McHugh, will allow officials to have access to the latest available public health advice.In an interview on Tuesday night, he said the easing of restrictions will impact on what is possible. For example, he said at present the maximum period a group of people can congregate indoors for is two hours, which would impact on the timing of inidual exams. These rules may change over the coming weeks, allowing longer exams to take place.Over what period of time will the exams take place?  Nothing is official yet, but there have been discussions over holding one major exam a day for public health reasons. The biggest exams - such as English, maths and Irish - could take place towards the start of the exam period to help speed up the marking process. Multiple smaller exams could be held towards the end of the exam window.This would see the Leaving Cert take place over a longer period and could stretch into early September - the 2nd of September has been mentioned - by the time all the exams are wrapped up.How certain is it that the Leaving Cert will go ahead? Nothing is guaranteed. Mr McHugh said holding the exam in late JulyAugust is the Department of Education’s “plan A” and all efforts will go towards making this happen.He acknowledged, however, this was based on the assumption that the public will continue to abide by public health restrictions and that the Covid-19 curve flattens further.As he said himself, the department is also examining “plans, B, C, D and E . . .” if the exams cannot go ahead.Why aren’t predicted grades being considered? Some other countries, such as the UK and France, are going down this route. Mr McHugh said it has been ruled out because there was “too much inherent bias” in the system.“There’s the practicality of teachers’ grading nieces, nephews, sons or daughters, or teachers who are easy markers or hard markers . . . we don’t feel the policy of predicted grading is a fair system,” he said, this week.Teachers’ unions and school management bodies share this view, though most students - based on an Irish Second Level Students’ Union poll - disagree.Some education figures, however, maintain it is still possible and there are safeguards to deal with bias.It has also been pointed out that the State Examinations Commission provides “expected grades” for students who - for reasons outside their control - cannot complete their exams.What measures are in place to assist students with poor broadband or a lack of devices? This is a real problem and threatens to widen the academic gap between the haves and have-nots.On Wednesday, Mr McHugh announced a multi-million euro fund for schools to buy devices for disadvantaged students.He also said the Government is working with telecoms companies to make a number of relevant websites “zero rated”. This would allow students to access these sites with no data costs.I’ve heard that the Junior Cycle is either cancelled or delayed. What’s actually happening? The Junior Cycle as originally planned is , in effect, cancelled. The Department of Education has replaced it with school-based exams which will not be graded by the State Examinations Commission. The tests will be marked by teachers.Students will not get a traditional Junior Certficate to mark their completion of three years of education.They will, however, get a school-issued “Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement” which will reflect classroom-based assessments, assessment tasks and project work.Do schools have to hold these tests in the next school year? Or can they hold their own in May? Coláiste Bhaile Chlair in Claregalway made headlines when it announced it will proceed with its own tests in May. Presentation Secondary School in Kilkenny has taken a similar decision. It is likely others will follow.The rules are a bit of a grey area - though it is hard to see how schools can be compelled to provide Junior Cycle tests in the next academic year given that they are no longer State-certified exams.Mr McHugh has asked schools to hold off announcing their own arrangements and is working on fresh pland and guidelines with school management bodies and other stakeholders.I’m worried about contracting the virus in an exam hall. What public health measures will be in place? These issues are still being worked on and will be guided by public health advice. The cancellation of the Junior Cycle exams makes it much easier to hold exams in study halls where desks are at least two metres apart.It is also likely there will be much greater use of “special centres” - or smaller exams centres, such as classrooms - for those who are immuno-compromised. Authorities insist that all measures will be guided by public health advice.Will I be able to contact my teachers after the normal term ends in May? Teachers’ unions have been told that the school term ends on Friday, May 29th.Mr McHugh has asked that everyone at that point take a break for two weeks, but that a “ line of contact” with schoolsteachers be available remotely after these two weeks.This is aimed at maintain a link with Leaving Cert students and helping to iron out issues or queries they may have, rather than teaching normal classes. It is then expected that from mid-July schools will reopen for two weeks.I’ve heard the schools will reopen for two weeks in July. When will this happen?  Mr McHugh has requested that schools and teachers provide two weeks of school-based engagement for Leaving Cert students in July, ahead of the start of the exams. This is likely to be from July 13th, though no official date has been announced.Will it be safe to go back to school? Social distancing will still be in operation, so it is likely that classes will be split into smaller groups.All teachers are being requested to return to school, so staff members will be available to support students for study skills, revision or other areas where they require help.I’ve heard of some resistance from teachers’ unions. Will teachers actually be in school?  There were contrasting signals from the two secondary teachers’ unions when the decision to postpone the exams was first announced.The TUI said it would encourage it members to support students, while the ASTI signalled that the plans could not be enforced. However, they both now seem to be on the same page and say that the needs of students must come first.There, of course, may be genuine healthy reasons why some teachers will not be available to return in July.When will we get our Leaving Cert results - and will colleges or further education courses start later as a result? No official date is available yet, though it is likely that results could be issued in October.Third level colleges say they will be in a position to admit students in late October or early November. Further education colleges will likely follow suit. Colleges say they will cut short holidays and reading weeks so students finish up as normal in May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4233580.1587407409!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china based corkman in the right place at the right time for ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Paul O’Brien used his expertise to procure PPE to send from China to Ireland. Photograph: Angela Ponce  BloombergWhen the Green Jersey awards are being handed out for service during the national pandemic there is sure to be one with the name of Dr Paul O’Brien on it.A China-based doctor and regulatory expert, Dr O’Brien could be said to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time when the Covid-19 outbreak started in that country at the beginning of the year. However, the 35-year-old Corkman proved to be the right man in the right place for Ireland when the disease started heading to Europe and he realised he could play a major role in our efforts to deal with the crisis. He first came to public attention when he wrote an open letter online to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and HSE boss Paul Reid in early March critiquing aspects of the national response to the pandemic. Based on his conversations with Chinese medics, he believed – correctly – that Europe was at the time sleepwalking itself into a crisis.“I was very worried because I had been in touch with Chinese docs and they said we seemed not to know what we’re in for.”But whereas others might have preferred to hurl on the ditch, O’Brien, eschewing an overtly political approach, has been of enormous practical assistance in sourcing help from China to bring to bear on the emerging crisis back at home.When the disease was still confined to China, he had been involved in trying to source personal protective equipment for local doctors from Europe. Now, he used his expertise to procure PPE to send from China to Ireland.Cork rootsFrom Montenotte, he got in touch with fellow Corkmen, GP Nick Flynn and respiratory consultant Oisin O’Connell. A WhatsApp group was set up which has become a lively forum for sourcing equipment and exchanging ideas on how best to address problem areas as the pandemic approached. Many of the supply issues for PPE and ventilators were solved through contacts on this group.O’Brien organised teleconferences in which Chinese doctors from Wuhan shared their expertise in fighting coronavirus. Another Corkman, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, was brought in to lend “gravitas” and help nail deals for the supply of equipment.He also translated a 146-page protocol used in a Chinese hospital so it could advise Irish hospitals on how best to treat patients with the virus.Meanwhile, O’Brien’s own life is on hold. Having studied genetics and food science, he had gone to China to train as a doctor at Zhejiang University. He is now married to a local woman and they have a young child. He had been due to travel to the US to do his final exams for practising medicine there but this was scuppered by the pandemic. And while he has applied to Ireland On Call, his Chinese qualifications are unlikely to be recognised quickly enough back at home.He is, however, optimistic that Ireland will succeed in curbing the advance of the virus and that a vaccine will be developed more quickly than many people expect.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: ReutersMassimo PincaPressure has increased on the Government to require that face masks be worn routinely by the public to contain the Covid-19 virus, in line with a change in scientific opinion in favour of the measure.Scientists and TDs have called for the change based on indication that basic face masks in social settings can prevent the spread of coronavirus.Meanwhile, the Irish Nurses \u0026amp Midwives Organisation has welcomed a change in national policy, which now mandates surgical face masks in all settings for any healthcare workers who provide care within 2m of a patient including where social distancing cannot be maintained.The Health Information and Quality Authority, which advises the Government and HSE on healthcare standards, said it is “currently reviewing international evidence on the effectiveness of face masks at reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses, including Covid-19, both in healthcare settings and in the community”.This review would be published shortly, a Hiqa spokeswoman said.In newly published guidelines, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises the wearing of basic masks including those made of cloth for all people in public spaces. Many other countries support the wearing of masks in such circumstances, while it is standard practice in many Asian countries in response to epidemics.The World Health Organisation, however, has not advised such action though it is reviewing the latest scientific evidence. In the past, it has warned that face masks can facilitate spread of the coronavirus, especially if they are used incorrectly. It has also highlighted the critical need for higher spec face masks to be available for healthcare workers at a time of shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE).Asymptomatic spreadA growing number of scientists, however, accept basic face masks may not prevent infection for a wearer but can protect others by not transmitting the virus they may not know they have – known as asymptomatic spread.Immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill of Trinity College Dublin said he believed people will soon be required to wear masks in public. He strongly recommended people wear them when going outside, citing evidence that when infected people speak they produce aerosols that carry the virus.Infectious diseases specialist Prof Sam McConkey of RCSI has also backed the wearing of masks by the public, but warned of unacceptable risk if it resulted in a shortage for frontline staff at a time when there is pressure to source PPE.People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith called on HSE officials on Wednesday to prepare a plan to make face masks freely and widely available for the general public and those who wish to wear them in public places.“We see this happening in other European cities and countries, so I think it’s right that any member of the public who is expected to return to work or school should have such masks freely available if they wish to wear them,” she added.She welcomed the change in policy on the use of protective equipment for healthcare workers, adding the change was especially welcome in nursing home settings. “The previous guidance was insane given the catastrophe we see in nursing homes, and the ability of the virus to spread via asymptomatic carriers.”INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said the revised policy was welcome news for frontline staff and patients, which should ease some anxiety and reduce transmission of the virus.“This should have been rolled out weeks ago, but we are glad to have finally secured this measure. It will not only benefit frontline healthcare workers, but will reduce the risk of transmission to patients.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

We’ll listen to any proposal that any other party puts forward,” Mr Varadkar said.

Photograph: Palazzo Chigi press officeAFP via Getty ImagesEuropean Union leaders will meet over video conference on Thursday in a bid to bridge deep isions over how to finance the response to the coronavirus pandemic, an issue some have warned has put the future of the union at stake.On the table is the contentious issue of how to pay for a recovery fund to dig the continent out of an economic slump, caused by the pandemic, that is expected to be the worst in a century.The issue is the subject of deep philosophical differences between member states, and was left unresolved when finance ministers agreed to a €540 billion package of funding measures earlier this month.Leaders will also attempt to reach a deal on the bloc’s seven-year budget, which they had failed to agree on prior to the pandemic due to a split over whether funding to it should increase or not.Is the future of the EU really at stake?Leaders including French president Emmanuel Macron have warned that the future of the euro currency area and the bloc itself hangs in the balance, and have demanded dramatic action to counter public disillusionment with the union and the rise of eurosceptics in national politics.\u0026nbspBut some old hands say claims that the EU is at a make-or-break moment are perennial, underestimate how deeply embedded the union is, and are often used by national leaders to exert political pressure to get what they want.\u0026nbspNevertheless the EU does face deep challenges. Some of its most treasured achievements are suspended, with citizens unable to travel freely from one country to another. The coronavirus has highlighted isions between the bloc’s members, including on what the future of the union should be. And the European project has become the subject of deep rancour in one of its founding member states as it finds itself in deepening financial trouble: Italy.Why is Italy central?Concerns about Italy going bust long predate the coronavirus pandemic. Its debt stood at 135 per cent of annual national output last year, the highest levels in Europe after Greece, and there have been warnings this could rise close to 160 per cent by December.It’s a precarious position for a country that has hardly grown economically in two decades, and that has now become the country in Europe hardest and longest hit by the pandemic, with the number of recorded deaths at 25,000 and rising.\u0026nbspThe Italian budget watchdog warns the economy will shrink by 15 per cent in the first half of the year, a contraction “never before recorded in the history of the republic”.\u0026nbspItaly has had to pay higher and higher costs to borrow money to fund its spending as the crisis hit because investors view it as a risk, a situation that threatens to become a debt spiral. An announcement by the European Central Bank that it would step in to buy debt to bid down interest rates has not stopped Italian bond yields rising amid market nervousness ahead of the summit.That is why the Italian government has been adamant in demanding the EU agree to issue jointly guaranteed debt, which would allow it to borrow at lower rates. It argues that this is in the interest of all EU states to protect their own economic interests, and that a major demonstration of solidarity is vital to counter the risk of eurosceptic parties coming to power, driven by deep public disillusionment due to years of economic stagnation and a sense of abandonment by Europe.As the EU’s third-largest economy, Italy going under is a much greater threat to the bloc and to the euro zone than the Greek sovereign debt crisis of the last decade. It could be described as “too big to fail”.How are member states ided?The Netherlands represents the opposite pole of opinion to Italy, leading a group of “frugal” states like Austria that want a cheaper EU and are staunchly against jointly backed debt as they fear ending up on the hook for the loans of weaker economies.\u0026nbspDutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra has made himself a reputation as a hardliner, and insists that emergency loans, such as through Europe’s bailout fund, should come with the condition that countries should balance their national budgets.Shared debt in the form of euro bonds were an Italian ambition long before the pandemic hit. Ireland was among nine member states to support the idea, but it doesn’t have enough backing to be approved.What deal is on the table?The European Commission has proposed a compromise that makes the recovery plan part of the budget. States would front extra funding into a pot, and the commission would borrow against this to raise additional money on financial markets. German chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated her support.But there is disagreement on various details, including on how the commission’s debt would be repaid. One proposal is to give the commission the power to raise its own revenues to make repayments through levying digital or plastic taxes, but this is fraught with potential political roadblocks.Where does Ireland stand?Ireland supports shared debt but isn’t fundamentalist in its position. Above all it wants a recovery plan that can be put in place quickly.One issue of concern is a turn towards protectionism, which Ireland criticised in a paper circulated last week. A letter from the European Council and commission published ahead of the summit said the bloc should “reduce over-dependency on third countries”, which goes against Ireland’s highly globalised economic model and commitment to free trade.\u0026nbspDublin will also defend long-running positions such maintaining funds for agriculture. The idea of a digital tax rings alarm bells, as it is feared as a threat to Ireland’s attractiveness to multinational tech companies.What are the potential outcomes?Few expect a major breakthrough to come from the summit. Any agreement is likely to be a list of principles, which will then be passed to the technical experts of the commission to be fleshed out in detail, before going back before national finance ministers for further fine-tuning. Much will depend on the detail, and the potential for future fallouts is strong,There are strong incentives for some kind of an agreement to be announced, as a failure to agree would likely shock financial markets and deepen Italy’s trouble on the bond markets.But the same could happen if markets do not find the agreement that emerges convincing. With deep political splits, whatever is agreed will be a careful weaving together of the political demands of 27 states, which doesn’t always result in the most practical outcome.“It won’t keep everyone happy,” one official predicted. “But it might be enough to keep the show on the road.”For further analysis ahead of Thursday’s EU summit:Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4235482.1587592451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"real simple choice al gore endorses joe biden for us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe Biden participates in a Democratic presidential primary in March. Photograph: Evan VucciAPFileFormer US vice president Al Gore endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday, adding to the growing circle of prominent Democrats throwing their support behind him as the party works to coalesce before the general election. Mr Gore announced his support in a tweet shortly before appearing, virtually, with Mr Biden for a town hall-style Earth Day event. His endorsement followed one earlier in the day from governor Jay Inslee of Washington, who ran a climate-focused campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.“If I was talking to one person who had not yet decided who to vote for in this upcoming election, I would just say plainly and simply: This is not complicated,” Mr Gore said at the Earth Day town hall. “If you care about the climate crisis, if you want to start solving the climate crisis, this is not rocket science.”“This is a real simple choice,” he added later, “and if anybody has any doubt about that, come talk to me.” Mr Gore served as vice president under Bill Clinton and was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000. InfluentialBut two decades later, he is better known for his climate activism. As vice president, he helped craft the Kyoto Protocol, which president George W Bush abandoned in 2001 just as president Donald Trump abandoned its successor, the Paris Agreement, in 2017. As a private citizen, he made the climate change documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.Mr Gore comes from a very different Democratic Party than the one that exists today, and served in an administration whose policies many Democrats, especially younger ones, now explicitly reject. But in an election in which voters have described climate change as one of the most important issues, his voice could be influential.During Wednesday’s event, he made an explicit pitch to young voters, who largely supported senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary. Youth-led climate groups like the Sunrise Movement endorsed Mr Sanders, and they are among the constituencies Mr Biden needs to win over for the general election.“I remember, as you do, when president John F Kennedy put out his inspiring challenge to put a person on the moon and return him safely in 10 years,” Mr Gore said, referring to an address Kennedy gave to Congress in May 1961, when Mr Gore was 13 and Mr Biden was 18. “And I remember the adults of that day and time, many of them saying that’s a reckless, expensive, unwise venture.”But when Apollo 11 landed on the moon eight years later, he continued, the average age of the system engineers in NASA’s mission control centre was 26. “That means their average age when they heard that speech was 18, and they changed their lives and they got the knowledge and the learning to be a part of that mission,” Mr Gore said. “That’s what I feel from the young people in this country today where the climate crisis is concerned.”Obama endorsementIt remains to be seen whether his endorsement will sway the young progressives who voted for Mr Sanders. What it certainly does is reinforce the central image Biden’s campaign is trying to present: a Democratic Party that has moved on quickly from its hard-fought primary and united around its presumptive nominee in the face of a once-in-a-lifetime threat.Within weeks after he essentially wrapped up the nomination, Mr Biden has received endorsements from former president Barack Obama, Mr Sanders and senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another primary opponent. His campaign has unveiled several major endorsements in quick succession as something of a show of force.

Instead of enjoying the new pleasure of silence and the new experience of unpolluted fresh air, we are bombarded by the noise and pollution of HMS Prince of Wales.The warship, which cost £3.1 billion to bring into service, boasts four Wärtsilä diesel generators, which each produces a total of 11 Megawatts of power – enough to sustain a town with a population of 25,000 people.The noise is the inevitable consequence of Portsmouth being the home of the Royal Navy, and having Britain’s two new aircraft carriers alongside at the same time will not often be the case.Similar complaints were made when the Type-45 Destroyers replaced the smaller Type-23s a few years ago.Local councillor Dawn Kelly has called on the navy to look at the noise problem, saying she can hear it from her home.She added: For those living in Clarence Yard the sound must be even louder as it gets reverberated around the square there.So I do think the residents have a valid complaint and I have urged them to approach environmental health.If the navy could do something to quieten the noise from the ship, that would be very welcome.It is Royal Navy policy to provide shore power to all vessels alongside whenever possible.An MoD spokesman told the : “We have got to make the ships habitable. They are the sailors\u0027 homes and the only place many have got to go, particularly among the junior ranks who are unmarried and so do not live in quarters. “That situation has been exacerbated by the requirements for social distancing which means unmarried sailors have been unable to return to their family homes.”Food still needs to be cooked and water pumps are required for showers all of which require power, the spokesman added. HMS Prince of Wales, which launched in December 2017, and her sister ship HMS Queen Elizabeth are the most powerful warships ever constructed in the UK.Each has two 33-tonne propellers which produce enough power to run 1,000 family cars, or 50 high speed trains.The 919ft carriers, designed to carry 36 fighter planes and four helicopters, can be put into action for work such as high-intensity war fighting or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief.In December 2019, the Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla attended an official commissioning ceremony to formally welcome the aircraft carrier into the Royal Navy.A Royal Navy spokesman said: The carriers and the power plant remain on initial trials, and there will be occasions when the ships will need to use their own generators.These periods are always for the minimum amount of time necessary.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public health england says everyone should consider taking vitamin","story":"Everyone should consider taking a Vitamin D supplement in lockdown, because they are unlikely to be getting enough sunshine, Public Health England has advised. Health officials have changed their advice, amid concern that indoor lifestyles are depriving the population of key nutrients.Vitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium – which is vital to maintaining healthy bones and teeth. A deficiency can lead to a number of conditions including rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, which cause bones to soften, weaken and in some cases become deformed.Until now, PHE has said everyone should consider taking a supplement during autumn and winter months, when sunshine is limited. Children, the elderly and those with some health conditions are already advised to consider doing so all year round. But the new advice says indoor lifestyles mean that everyone should think about taking a daily supplement to ensure they have enough levels of the “sunshine supplement”.However, the public are advised “Do not buy more than you need,” amid fears stocks will run out if people stockpile.The PHE coronavirus update states: “Consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to keep your bones and muscles healthy. This is because you may not be getting enough vitamin D from sunlight if you’re indoors most of the day.”Vitamin D is known to support the immune system, and some scientists believe it may reduce an inidual’s susceptibility” to the virus, as it can help protect against acute respiratory infections.However, PHE said there was no evidence that the vitamin can reduce the risk of coronavirus. Dr Alison Tedstone, PHE chief nutritionist, said: With the nation staying in to save lives and protect the NHS, many people are spending more time indoors and may not get all the vitamin D they need from sunlight.To protect their bone and muscle health, they should consider taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin D,” she said. Graham Keen, executive director of the Health Food Manufacturers Association said “Whilst vitamin D supplementation has long been recommended for key population groups, this broadened advice is welcome to help everyone maintain healthy joints and muscles.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rail companies told ready increase timetables may 11 union claims","story":"Train firms have been told they may need to increase their timetables as early as May 11, it has been claimed, prompting speculation the lockdown could be partially lifted.The RMT, the biggest union for railway workers, said it has received information suggesting that ministers have told companies to be ready to boost the number of services on either May 11 or May 18.However, speaking at the Government\u0027s daily coronavirus briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said such an increase in railway usage is not a timetable being considered by the Government.He said: It would be a mistake to take our eye off the ball right now. The focus is still on delivering us through the peak and we\u0027re obviously reliant on the data we get back from Sage in a couple of weeks time in order to even think about the next phase.The lockdown is currently in place until at least May 7, when the situation will be reviewed, but it has been suggested it could last until June.Trains are currently operating a reduced service to ensure key workers can get to work, although there were reports of overcrowding early on in the lockdown.The RMT said there was “zero chance” of an agreement to increase services early next month and raised concerns that as many as a third of its members have not been issued with PPE.Mick Cash, the union\u0027s general secretary, said: “We are being told by a range of rail companies that ministers definitely want to be ready to increase rail services at some point in May.“Yet our survey of 10,000 transport workers has shown there are widespread failures to provide even the most basic protections for our members. If these are not addressed then a ramping up of transport services will also ramp up the risk to workers and passengers.”He said he would be writing to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to lay out his concerns.A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train firms, said: “Rail companies and our people are doing all we can to support the country throughout this pandemic and we will play our vital role in getting the country moving again.”It is understood that train companies are planning ahead to ensure they are ready to increase the number of trains running when appropriate, but that no date has been agreed.The RDG spokesman said: “How and when more people travel during the next phase of the pandemic is a matter for government.”The RMT said it is concerned for the safety of workers. According to its survey, two out of five of those questioned said their employer has put profit or business priorities before safety, a third described action to protect them from Covid-19 as poor or terrible, and most said they had not been tested for the virus.Mr Cash said: “We will not accept unsafe directives being handed down on high from the boardroom or the cabinet room. “Transport workers are key workers in keeping essential workers and goods moving and that means they will be key in deciding when it’s safe to increase transport services.”The RDG spokesman said: “Our priority has always been the safety of our staff and passengers and we will work closely with the government and unions on how services can be returned to normal safely to support the economy and public health.”The Government has set clear tests which need to be passed before travel restrictions are lifted, and has insisted it will be guided by scientific advice.A Department for Transport spokesman said: “Our advice is clear that the best way to protect our NHS and save lives is to stay home if possible. Key services are running to ensure those who need to get to work – including vital NHS staff – can do so.“Any changes to service levels will be clearly communicated, subject to Public Health England guidance and discussed with industry and unions.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second coronavirus peak horizon means uks exit strategy","story":"In a press conference beamed across the nation on March 12, a bullish Boris Johnson announced that the government’s coronavirus strategy was to ‘flatten the peak’ of cases, or in the prime minister’s more flamboyant words, to ‘squash the sombrero.’The goal, Mr Johnson explained, was not to suppress the virus entirely, but to keep infections at a lowish level to avoid overwhelming health services and prevent a deadly second wave.At that point, just eight people had died in Britain from the virus out of the 590 who had tested positive. Lockdown was more than 10 days away, and the government was still hoping that herd immunity could be achieved. A day after the press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, gave a television interview suggesting that 60 per cent of people would need to become infected to protect the population. Yet after Imperial College modelling suggested such a ‘mitigation’ strategy could bring 250,000 deaths, the Government made a rapid volte face, imposing strict social distancing measures and closing businesses and schools on March 23.The impact of such extreme suppression means that a second peak, far higher than the first, is now a near certainty and that has major implications for how Britain must exit the lockdown if such a catastrophe is to be avoided.  Here is what we know about a second wave and how it impacts the future:In the first graphs, shown by Mr Johnson in March, ‘squashing the sombrero’ would cause the first peak to come in the summer, towards the end of May. The rounded peak appeared to be about half the size of that expected if the disease was left to run rampant through the population.Under that scenario the NHS would be able to cope and the virus would not present a problem later in the year. Sir Patrick told journalists: “We want to… not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.”However, under the current suppression plan, the trajectory of the disease has changed dramatically, with the peak moving to the middle of December. Alarmingly it appears every bit as high and deadly as the unmitigated wave that the government was so keen to avoid. Although experts believe that we have now peaked in the first wave, it is actually only a very low level of what could happen if lockdown is lifted without any means to suppress a second, far more deadly wave. Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who led the modelling and who sits on The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said: “There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place.”One of the problems of Britain’s lockdown strategy is just how effective it has been. Suppression modelling was based on all households reducing contact outside of the household, school or workplace by up to 75 per cent. Workplace contact rates were to reduce by 25 per cent On April 13, the Government released its first graphs showing how the public was complying to lockdown. Workplaces were down 54 per cent and retail and recreation down 85 per cent.Likewise, people appear to be doing better at self-isolating that was expected. It was assumed that just 70 per cent of people with symptoms of coronavirus would stay at home as instructed, but research by health experts Evergreen Life, shows in most areas of Britain, more than 90 per cent are complying and even in the worst areas 75 per cent are still staying put.Although the modelling predicted that all schools would shut, it assumed 25 per cent of universities would remain open.Data published by the Department for Education this week showed that less than one per cent of children are going to school every day despite estimates from ministers that it would be up to 20 per cent. Likewise, it was thought that 50 per cent of people diagnosed with the virus would stay in quarantine for 14 days. Yet there is little evidence of people breaking quarantine and powers of arrest have now been given to police to stop it from happening.A small study from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) found people had cut contacts by around 73 per cent, roughly in line with government expectations.While such compliance has been excellent at keeping the virus under control, leading to noticeable downturn in cases in the past week, it means few people are building up immunity.In the critical Imperial Paper published on March 16, scientists warned that once restrictions were relaxed infections would inevitably begin to rise again and the bounce back would be far worse if suppression was too extreme.“The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity,” the researchers warned.Experts on the Government’s Sage committee now believe that only about 5 per cent of the population has been infected with the disease and that there is ‘almost no herd immunity’ in Britain.Under the government’s mitigation strategy, the reproduction - or ‘R’ - number, would reduce dramatically, but not to below one, so cases would rise, but only slowly, until hitting a peak.Under the suppression strategy, the reproduction rate falls from around 2.6 to below 1 and the virus dies away. But reducing infections now can store up problems for the future. The government is currently carrying out a testing programme to determine how many people in Britain have recovered from the disease to work out current immunity level, but so far it has not published the findings.Several studies have now put it at roughly six per cent and new results this week from the The Pasteur Institute show just 5.7 per cent of the French will have contracted coronavirus by the time the country starts lifting lockdown next month.The institute researchers warned of a high risk of a second wave unless drastic social distancing is maintained.Karol Skiora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham has been carrying out his own antibody testing and believes that between eight to 10 per cent of people are likely to have had coronavirus so far. “We’re nowhere near herd immunity,” he said. “We could definitely have a second peak. You look at countries like Austria where they have opened their garden centres and small shops a week ago and they seem to have more cases again, so it is a real worry.”Imperial College predicted that strict lockdown measures would be needed for at least five months, but they also warned that restrictions and widespread monitoring would have to stay in place until a vaccine was available, to prevent a second wave. Dozens of research labs across the globe are now working on vaccines and a team at Oxford believe they could have a viable jab ready by the autumn. Yet scaling up will present a problem and it is likely that only frontline workers will be given vaccines initially leaving the general public waiting until at least next year. That delay means there will be restrictions such as social distancing in place for many months to come. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government’s Sage group and the Director of the Wellcome Trust said the disease would not be going away anytime soon and future waves were likely.“We must assume and prepare for the fact that this is not a discrete one off episode,” he said.“My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection. It is likely that this is here with the human race for the future. We’re going to have to find ways to deal with that.“The real moving forward is we have to have new tests, we have to have drugs that treat this infection, and critically we need to have vaccines so we can prevent what we should assume are future waves.”In recent weeks, journalists have questioned why the government is continuing to invest in huge numbers of intensive care beds at Nightingale Hospitals while cases are on the decline.The possibility of a second peak is likely to be the reason.While the current epidemic appears to have stabilised below 1,000 cases a day, modelling of a second wave suggests that it could be far higher if it is not brought under control through mass testing, contact tracing and isolation after lockdown.Asked whether the Nightingale Hospitals were being kept for a possible second wave, a Downing Street spokesman said: “I am certainly not aware of any plans to stand down these Nightingale Hospitals and some are still being built.”Fears of a second wave of coronavirus has made governments around the world nervous about lifting their own lockdowns too early and too quickly and Britain is no exception.A safety net of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation of those infected must be in place to ensure that cases are not allowed to rise, while ‘squashing the sombrero’ of a second peak may now be a viable option.Ilan Kelman, Professor of Disasters and Health, University College London said: “A second peak of infection could be manageable if we protect those who are vulnerable, treat those who get sick, do not reduce other medical services, and meet all healthcare worker needs. “Another possible strategy is a staged stand-down of lockdown to flatten a second peak, provided that those who are told to remain in lockdown, or who cannot work because of it, are given all the support they need to avoid difficult effects of being isolated while others resume life.”In China, a spike in infections after weeks of falling rates has forced the authorities to impose new restrictions.In the north-eastern city of Harbin a 22-year-old university student who returned from the US was identified as the source of more than 40 new infections, while Chinese citizens returning from Siberia via the border town of Suifenhe led to more than 400 confirmed new cases.The examples show the huge problem in restarting life again after a strict lockdown when so few of the population are immune. In Germany, the country credited with keeping its outbreak under tight control through its use of extensive testing and contact tracing has seen a rise in deaths as the country was re-opening some small shops and preparing for children to return to school from May 4.The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday that any second wave of coronavirus was likely to be even more serious if it coincided with the start of flu season.Robert Redfield told The Washington Post: “There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000228196021_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"vulnerable children should school especially lockdown","story":"It is undeniable that there is a group of children who are left out of the nation’s progress. They are the kids most likely to fall out of school, have lower life chances and poorer health. Hundreds of thousands of them are living in fragile families and are extremely vulnerable to a cocktail of risks: domestic violence, alcohol or drug abuse, severe parental mental health problems, homelessness, and hunger. They live on the edge of the care system. Some have social workers, but others go under the radar. They are often the children exploited by gangs or ruthless criminals.The risks facing these children are heightened during lockdown. That’s why it was so important that the Government kept schools open not just for the kids of key workers but also for the most vulnerable children. School is a safe place, and it is schools that so often pick up on serious problems early. Around one in five children referred to social services has been flagged up by their school.Yet we know now what I’d already been hearing anecdotally – the vast majority of vulnerable children aren’t turning up to school. Statistics published this week show that before the Easter holidays around 95 per cent of them were not there, meaning they were at home where they are out of sight and can be exposed to that cocktail of risks. The numbers attending may have gone up slightly after the Easter break, but thousands of vulnerable children are still invisible.Partly, this will be due to the success of the “stay at home” messaging. Some families feel stigmatised about being labelled “vulnerable”. Others will be too chaotic. Sadly, there will also be children at risk of abuse, whose abusers are using the lockdown to keep their victims out of view.Domestic violence is on the increase, which has a profound effect on children, and weeks of lockdown are also likely to lead to or worsen existing serious mental health conditions or addictions. We don’t know yet how it impacts on the county lines networks sucking in so many vulnerable children, though early indications are that activities have been disrupted.Poll: Impact on well-beingWe need to keep these children in our sights. The Department for Education must now turbocharge its efforts to improve attendance. Councils and schools must do more, too. I know many schools are active in reaching out to parents of vulnerable children and I’ve heard teachers talking about the sleepless nights they’re experiencing, thinking about what may be happening behind closed doors. With vulnerable children’s attendance at only five per cent, though, I worry some schools aren’t doing enough.We also need to see much clearer messaging from the Government for children, parents, social workers and teachers about the importance of getting these kids into school, along with safety assurances.Alongside the problems of keeping vulnerable children safe, the longer the lockdown goes on, the more the “disadvantage gap” will widen between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged school pupils. About 700,000 children don’t have a laptop or tablet they can use at home, others are living in B\u0026ampBs, converted office blocks or sofa-surfing – not ideal environments for home schooling. These children are at risk of falling further behind. So, I’d like to see schools inviting back the 20 per cent of children in each year group they judge are most at risk of falling behind, for one day a week. School attendance would still be around just four per cent in secondary schools.I’ve spent the last few years shining a light on the difficulties facing vulnerable children and pressing the Government to make improving their lives a priority, and shortly I will be launching a new data tool designed to better identify vulnerable children who need help both during the lockdown and once the crisis has passed. But I do believe this lockdown is opening the eyes of many to the generational problems that have blighted the life chances of millions of our children for decades.The Government’s hand has been forced by this virus to spend billions more on the NHS and on keeping people’s finances afloat. I hope the same support for vulnerable children – to protect them now and to help them do well in the future – will be a key part of the “new normal”.Anne Longfield OBE is Children’s Commissioner for EnglandThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This means producers have access to large, mobile oil tankers and are not reliant on inland storage facilities which are close to full.The falls highlight huge excess supply of oil as demand has fallen by around 30 per cent because of measures taken to tackle Covid-19.While planes have been grounded, large parts of industry have been shut down and millions of people ordered to stay at home, oil producers have continued to pump out crude.Governments in some countries have tentatively begun to loosen lockdown controls but deep uncertainty remains about the global economy\u0027s future.Should environmentalists rejoice or despair over negative oil prices?Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit, warned that negative oil prices indicated a wider economic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Government orders to stay at home mean that most drivers will feel little benefit from falling prices however.Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said the average prices for litres of petrol and diesel should be 98p and 106p.

We can’t replace the people we lose,’ says retail bossCath Kidston permanently closed all of its stores with the loss of 900 jobs, while Primark\u0027s\u0026nbspowner said sales had fallen to zero and it had furloughed 68,000 staff on another ominous day for British retailers, who have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, pubs, bars and restaurants warned MPs that they face a “bloodbath” as lockdown conditions are eased, with up to a third of the sector at risk of going out of business.Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns budget retailer Primark, was the first to sound the alarm on Tuesday, as it revealed that sales had dropped from £650m per month to zero as a result of all its stores closing in Europe and the US.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnlike many rivals, Primark does not sell clothes online\u0026nbsp— meaning it has been unable to mitigate lost revenues by ramping up deliveries to customers’ homes.ABF boss George Weston said the group had been “squarely in the path of this pandemic” and would have had to have laid off staff if governments had not implemented furlough schemes which cover wage costs.Pre-tax profits slumped 42 per cent to £298m for the half-year to February as Primark was left with millions of pounds of stock it was unable to sell. The company wrote down the value of its stock by £243m.Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, “we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal”.“In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.”Home furnishings chain Cath Kidston confirmed on Tuesday that its 60 stores will not reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ends, with just 32 out of 940 employees to keep their jobs.The brand will continue after a deal with the one of the retailer’s shareholders, Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA), which will buy the online business, brand and wholesale arm from administrators Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal.With unemployment set to soar, the government needs a ‘Cobra for jobs’Melinda Paraie, chief executive officer of Cath Kidston, said: “While we are pleased that the future of Cath Kidston has been secured, this is obviously an extremely difficult day as we say goodbye to many colleagues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is no suggestion that Mr Christodolou knew about the contents of the letter.Last month, the government suspended all eviction proceedings for 90 days as part of emergency measures to protect renters, but campaigners argue further action is needed.Under the temporary rules, tenants can also ask their landlord for a rent repayment holiday if they are struggling to pay, although they will have to make up the arrears after the period of national emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The current crisis has brought these issues into stark relief.“With millions of low-paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking timebomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the suspension in court proceedings is lifted.”Landlords welcomed the proposal to increase public funding to cover tenants’ rent payments.\u0026nbspBen Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said the group supported an increase in the housing allowance.Future of UK shopping centres in doubt as retailers stop paying rentHe added: “In addition, we repeat our call on the Government to scrap the five-week wait for the first payment of Universal Credit immediately and ensure tenants can have the housing element of the credit paid directly to their landlord if they wish.”Private landlords received £23bn of public money through housing benefit payments last year, money that critics argue would be better spent on ending a chronic undersupply of social and affordable housing.The Money Advice Trust, a charity that runs the National Debtline, is calling for holidays for council tax bills, which, along with rent, are among the most common reasons for people to fall into debt.“People struggling with council tax bills, self-employed people facing immediate hardship, and private renters are particularly at risk of falling into serious financial difficulty,” said Joanna Elson, the charity’s chief executive.“The government must take urgent action to close the gaps in its Covid-19 financial support package, or many more households will fall into problem debt.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection. It has been in millions of people already and it is likely that this is here with the human race for the future.“I believe this virus will continue to circulate in human populations for many many years to come, if not permanently.”He said societies would need to find ways to combat the infection with public health measures like social distancing and wearing masks but he said the real “movement forward” would be new tests and treatments.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“We have to have drugs to treat this infection because it will come back and there will be people that get sick.

With a price of £419, it very nearly matches the lowest debut price for an iPhone, too. That was the original iPhone SE which launched in March 2016 for £359.This is the first time Apple has recycled a phone’s name. The original SE (the two letters don’t stand for anything, by the way) matched the chassis of the iPhone 5s with a much newer, more powerful processor – the chip from the iPhone 6s. Since the processor is the most important component in a phone, having the most up-to-date one was remarkable.The new iPhone SE follows the same process. The iPhone 8, first launched in 2017, is the body that’s used here, but the very latest A13 Bionic processor from last autumn’s iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro is waiting inside. The A13 Bionic is the fastest processor ever in a smartphone.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNot only does this mean the iPhone SE runs very fast, with the latest apps compatible and the most advanced games running smoothly, it also allows the camera to be way more effective than it was in the iPhone 8, even though the hardware is basically unchanged.Apple says it is the most advanced single-camera system it has ever made – more powerful than the one in the iPhone XR (released in 2018) and currently priced from £629. If taking good photos is important to you, the SE is arguably the one you’d go for, and save £210 as you do.The reasons for choosing the XR, by the way, would include an OLED display that’s bigger than the SE and covers almost the entire front of the phone, plus facial recognition features.If you’ve ever seen the iPhone 8, then you know what this phone looks like. It is almost identical apart from tiny design enhancements such as moving the Apple logo on the back to the centre. This also means that, glass back apart, it’s similar to the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s (except this phone has no headphone jack) and iPhone 7. It’s what Apple would call a beloved design.There’s a 4.7in LCD display with right-angled corners, not the curved corners to match the bezel found on the iPhone X onwards. There are noticeable non-screen areas at the top and bottom of the phone, with the front-facing camera at the top and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor in the Home button at the bottom. This is in contrast to many flagship phones where the display creeps right to the edges.The display looks good, and you quickly forget about the blank areas. But it’s certainly a change, though as someone who routinely uses a bigger-screened phone, the biggest change in using the iPhone SE was how much smaller everything was, especially the keyboard. I’m used to the bigger screen and my fingers no longer seem dainty enough to type accurately and at speed on a small one, though it’s still usable. For comparison, I also tried typing on the original iPhone SE, which, with its 4in display, was just too small, now. And, let’s remember, the first five iPhones came with a smaller screen than that. How times change.Apple routinely puts potent processors in its phones, but as subsequent hardware and advanced apps create greater demand, faster chips are needed. The fact that the iPhone SE’s processor is so much more powerful than previous iPhones – and the processors in any other phone, actually – makes the SE attractive. Not only does everything happen at speed, from opening apps to smooth video playback, it makes the hardware capable of much more.The camera is a case in point. It’s actually the same camera, in sensor and component terms, that the iPhone 8 had in 2017. Apple didn’t need to upgrade the camera hardware to make its photographic capabilities better. That’s because so much of smartphone photography is now down to the software.Battery life is good, though the huge leap forward Apple introduced with the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro is not matched here. But it is easily enough to get you through a full day with no anxiety. Unlike the original iPhone SE, the glass back means this one is wirelessly rechargeable.It’s not that the iPhone 8 camera was poor – it had a lot of strong features, but the addition of the A13 Bionic chip is transformational. Now, much more is possible.Portrait mode, where the background is blurred while your subject is in sharp focus, wasn’t on the iPhone 8. Usually it needs two cameras shooting together to work out what’s the subject and what’s background. But from the iPhone XR onwards, and on some smartphones from Google, for instance, this effect is achieved in software.Here, as on the iPhone XR, portrait mode only works for people, so gorgeous photos of pets won’t have that buttery defocused background. The A13 Bionic means it can do a very good job with people, and even allows you to adjust the level of background blur afterwards, helpfully showing you the aperture equivalent in the result.You can also add special effects, like stage light which turns the background into the darkness outside the spotlight.It also does something called semantic rendering. No, me neither, but it’s really about how the machine learning in the chip can take an image to pieces and rebuild it once it’s understood what’s in the frame, processing hair differently from skin, from eyes and so on.There’s a danger when you rely on algorithms and computer chips instead of, well, great glass and studio lighting, for instance. If the programmers have got things even a tiny bit wrong, the results can be tragic.Fortunately, the engineers at Apple who make these decisions are the most accomplished around. Much more importantly than that, they have exceptionally good taste.This is the only iPhone to combine a single camera sensor and the A13 Bionic chip, so perhaps it’s not surprising the photos it takes are deeply impressive.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

It cost £50 more and had a much older processor.But, really, I should have been comparing it to the first iPhone SE. After all, that was the first iPhone designed to be super-affordable as well as mighty powerful, thanks to its then-current cutting-edge processor.But while the first iPhone SE at the time was the right size to feel comfortable and easy to manage, now, it just seems tiny. The new phone, compared to most phones on the market, is compact without being titchy, and is a great fit in the hand.The new iPhone SE is a world away from the first, with 64GB storage (the original had 16GB), that larger display, improved design and – above all – the fastest phone processor on the planet. Its lead-in price of £419 is amazingly competitive and will make it a blockbuster seller. Remember, this phone is £730 cheaper than the iPhone 11 Pro Max. That phone has a lot of extra features and a huge screen, but both phones share the same storage capacity and processor.If you want the latest features such as Face ID, triple cameras and an all-screen front to your smartphone, well, Apple can oblige with its iPhone 11 series. But for many, that will be overkill.If you want something compact, highly affordable but still every bit as speedy as the fastest phone money can buy, then the iPhone SE is hard to resist.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Netflix had predicted it would add 7 million during the period.The company warned that it expected fewer new subscribers from July to December compared with a year earlier, however. Many people who would have joined then are likely to have already signed up, executives said.Tiger King is one of Netflix’s biggest ever showsWe expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends, Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.The company is among the few businesses to benefit from government orders imposed in March to keep people away from each other in order to stop the spread of the highly infectious novel coronavirus. While the S\u0026ampP 500 Index has fallen 19 per cent\u0026nbspfrom its 19 February record high, Netflix has gained 11 per cent\u0026nbspduring the same period.Netflix also issued a bullish forecast that it would add 7.5 million new customers for the current quarter, which ends in June, though the company said it was mostly guesswork given uncertainty over when stay-at-home orders might be lifted. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 3.8 million.Investing senior analyst Haris Anwar said Netflix\u0027s big gains showed it\u0027s the ultimate stay-at-home stock.That said, there\u0027s no guarantee that a global recession and increased competition won\u0027t hit Netflix in the latter part of the year, Anwar said. There\u0027s little clarity from the company about the future, and that\u0027s likely to hurt the stock in the short run.Netflix said the shutdown of film and TV production around the world had temporarily increased its free cash flow but could delay some programming by a quarter. In the second quarter, the impact will be modest and mostly will affect dubbing in various languages, the company said.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The company posted diluted earnings per share of $1.57, below the $1.65 consensus, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Total revenue rose to $5.77 billion from $4.52 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.76 billion.Appreciation of the U.S. dollar, due partially to the coronavirus crisis, dragged on international revenue, the company said.In the quarter, Netflix true-crime documentary Tiger King, about a colorful Oklahoma zookeeper, became a cultural sensation. It also released reality show Love is Blind, and a new season of Spanish-language thriller Money Heist.As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive with the debut of Walt Disney Co\u0027s Disney+ and upcoming rivals. That has pushed Netflix to look for growth overseas.The company\u0027s biggest expansion from January through March came from Europe, where it added 4.4 million new customers.The most popular Netflix plan in the United States costs $13, nearly double the $7-per-month cost for Disney+.Netflix does not currently plan to raise its prices given the global pandemic, Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said.At this point we are not even thinking about price increases, Peters said.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It did not specify whether such updates would be included in the changes, or what might no longer make its way to subscribers.The company did say that it was seeing “significant disruption when it comes to customer support and content production”. It has mostly fixed the problems with customer services and has hired 2,000 more agents to cope with the increased demand, it said, but almost all filming has now stopped except in select countries such as Korea and Iceland.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This means producers have access to large, mobile oil tankers and are not reliant on inland storage facilities which are close to full.The falls highlight huge excess supply of oil as demand has fallen by around 30 per cent because of measures taken to tackle Covid-19.While planes have been grounded, large parts of industry have been shut down and millions of people ordered to stay at home, oil producers have continued to pump out crude.Governments in some countries have tentatively begun to loosen lockdown controls but deep uncertainty remains about the global economy\u0027s future.Should environmentalists rejoice or despair over negative oil prices?Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit, warned that negative oil prices indicated a wider economic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Government orders to stay at home mean that most drivers will feel little benefit from falling prices however.Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, said the average prices for litres of petrol and diesel should be 98p and 106p. He claimed that the UK\u0027s fuel suppliers had dishonestly held back falls in wholesale costs which took place last month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We can’t replace the people we lose,’ says retail bossCath Kidston permanently closed all of its stores with the loss of 900 jobs, while Primark\u0027s\u0026nbspowner said sales had fallen to zero and it had furloughed 68,000 staff on another ominous day for British retailers, who have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, pubs, bars and restaurants warned MPs that they face a “bloodbath” as lockdown conditions are eased, with up to a third of the sector at risk of going out of business.Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns budget retailer Primark, was the first to sound the alarm on Tuesday, as it revealed that sales had dropped from £650m per month to zero as a result of all its stores closing in Europe and the US.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnlike many rivals, Primark does not sell clothes online\u0026nbsp— meaning it has been unable to mitigate lost revenues by ramping up deliveries to customers’ homes.ABF boss George Weston said the group had been “squarely in the path of this pandemic” and would have had to have laid off staff if governments had not implemented furlough schemes which cover wage costs.Pre-tax profits slumped 42 per cent to £298m for the half-year to February as Primark was left with millions of pounds of stock it was unable to sell. The company wrote down the value of its stock by £243m.Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, “we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal”.“In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.”Home furnishings chain Cath Kidston confirmed on Tuesday that its 60 stores will not reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ends, with just 32 out of 940 employees to keep their jobs.The brand will continue after a deal with the one of the retailer’s shareholders, Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA), which will buy the online business, brand and wholesale arm from administrators Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal.With unemployment set to soar, the government needs a ‘Cobra for jobs’Melinda Paraie, chief executive officer of Cath Kidston, said: “While we are pleased that the future of Cath Kidston has been secured, this is obviously an extremely difficult day as we say goodbye to many colleagues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That\u0027s my prediction. We will take corrective action if it\u0027s above zero, he said.I\u0027ve not met someone who can tell me where all of them are, so it can\u0027t be that big of a deal.A backup launch window for the latest batch is available on Thursday afternoon should weather conditions not be favourable on Wednesday.Following the launch, which will be broadcast in a live stream on\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0027s\u0026nbspofficial\u0026nbspYouTube page, the Falcon 9 rocket will land on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is no suggestion that Mr Christodolou knew about the contents of the letter.Last month, the government suspended all eviction proceedings for 90 days as part of emergency measures to protect renters, but campaigners argue further action is needed.Under the temporary rules, tenants can also ask their landlord for a rent repayment holiday if they are struggling to pay, although they will have to make up the arrears after the period of national emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The current crisis has brought these issues into stark relief.“With millions of low-paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking timebomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the suspension in court proceedings is lifted.”Landlords welcomed the proposal to increase public funding to cover tenants’ rent payments.\u0026nbspBen Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said the group supported an increase in the housing allowance.Future of UK shopping centres in doubt as retailers stop paying rentHe added: “In addition, we repeat our call on the Government to scrap the five-week wait for the first payment of Universal Credit immediately and ensure tenants can have the housing element of the credit paid directly to their landlord if they wish.”Private landlords received £23bn of public money through housing benefit payments last year, money that critics argue would be better spent on ending a chronic undersupply of social and affordable housing.The Money Advice Trust, a charity that runs the National Debtline, is calling for holidays for council tax bills, which, along with rent, are among the most common reasons for people to fall into debt.“People struggling with council tax bills, self-employed people facing immediate hardship, and private renters are particularly at risk of falling into serious financial difficulty,” said Joanna Elson, the charity’s chief executive.“The government must take urgent action to close the gaps in its Covid-19 financial support package, or many more households will fall into problem debt.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered. The charities like The Felix Project and Made in Hackney are doing really important work, and it seems like they enjoy doing it too.

Now, writes Mark Critchley,\u0026nbspthere are fears this gathering of more than 50,000 fans could prove to have been\u0026nbspa costly errorLittle more than a month ago, coronavirus was beginning to grip Britain. There were almost 600 cases, UK deaths were being counted and doctors in northern Italy were warning of the nightmare to come. But at Anfield on 11 March, more than 52,000 people made their way to Anfield to watch Liverpool’s\u0026nbspelimination from the Champions League at the hands of Atletico Madrid, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the stands.The crowd that night included 3,000 away supporters who had largely travelled from Madrid, despite the match coming a day after gatherings of more than 1,000 people had been banned in Spain.At that stage – before keeping two metres from the next person became a way of life – the UK government’s policy was that shutting down mass gatherings like the match at Anfield or the Cheltenham Festival, held the same week, would have only a minimal effect on limiting the spread of the coronavirus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEven in the days that followed, once the Premier League and Football League took matters into their own hands and suspended fixtures, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told journalists at No 10’s daily press briefing that banning mass gatherings was not a priority.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIt took until the following Monday – 16 March, five days after the game at Anfield and the World Health Organisation’s\u0026nbspdeclaration that humanity was in the grip of a pandemic – for Boris Johnson to finally advise against large-scale events. There were 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Merseyside at the time. Now, there are nearly 3,000, with 448 deaths recorded in the region’s hospitals.In light of those numbers and the growing nationwide death toll, it is only natural to ask whether the match at Anfield that night – the last match to be held in Britain with such a high attendance – should have gone ahead at all.For Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby, there’s no need for hindsight to see the incorrect decision was made – he says the warning signs were there all along. Byrne is a lifelong Liverpool supporter who would have attended the match if he had not been working in parliament. Instead, he gave his ticket to his son and – alongside fellow Merseyside MPs Dan Carden and Maria Eagle – worked to raise the issue with health secretary Matt Hancock in the House of Commons.“It was a massive, massive concern,” Byrne says, finding the presence of fans from an emerging coronavirus hotspot particularly baffling. At the time, 782 of Spain’s 1,646 cases were contained in the capital. “If we were playing in Madrid, they wouldn’t be able to attend. Suddenly they can all get on planes, come here without any hindrance, attend the game in the city and act like you would act, doing what you want to do and enjoying the event.”There is a sense warnings from elsewhere were not heeded either. Three weeks earlier, a Champions League game between Atalanta – a team from Bergamo, the epicentre of Italy’s crisis – and Valencia was played in Milan. The match has been described by Bergamo’s mayor as a “biological bomb” which accelerated the spread of the virus in Lombardy. “It was out there, the evidence was out there but it wasn’t getting listened to. We weren’t listened to,” says Byrne. “I just found it utterly infuriating.”On the evening of the game, Hancock responded to questions in the Commons by claiming that it was too easy to draw a link between crowds and contagion. “Sometimes the things that we, as lay people, may feel intuitively will have the biggest impact do not in fact have the biggest impact,” he said. “There are some things that feel right but do not have an impact at all.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut Sridhar Venkatapuram, of the Global Health Institute at King’s College London, can only politely describe the relaxed attitude towards mass gatherings during the early days of the crisis as “very interesting”, with a clear note of scepticism. “If we care about iniduals going out of their house, then 50,000 people coming together should worry us even more,” he says. “Concerts, sports matches, political rallies, pilgrimages: all these kinds of things intensify the frequency at which people will come into contact with each other and the rate at which the virus is infecting other people.“If there are 54,000 fans at a football stadium, I cannot tell you exactly where the greatest infections happen. I would be able to tell you that if you put two people together, it’s more likely the second person is going to be infected as opposed to one person being on their own. If one person is infected and surrounded by 10 people, it’s more likely that more than one other person is going to be infected.”And of course, football matches not only mean tens of thousands of fans shouting and cheering in close proximity to each other. They also involve them eating, drinking and socialising together in public spaces, then travelling together on public transport. “There’s nothing better than going to a European away game,” Byrne says. “Obviously the Spanish fans would have taken full advantage of the hospitality that Liverpool would have given them.”Venkatapuram believes that, by 11 March, the unnecessary risk of holding large events should have been clear. “Seeing a variety of patterns, seeing France, Italy and all these countries taking drastic steps, the UK should have been much more concerned about the health and wellbeing of its citizens and should have started to work on the big issues: should international travel be stopped? Should large gatherings of 50,000 people be stopped?”Those are questions that Byrne hopes will be answered by a future inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus crisis. “Hopefully once we all get through this and we can have a look at how it was handled and how we learn from it,” he says. And if\u0026nbspevidence emerges that events of 11 March contributed to Merseyside’s developing crisis, he wants the Anfield decision to be revisited. “That should be an absolute key part of any report.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He picked up a van at a depot in northwest London, drove more than 100 miles to pick up two tons of surplus food, returned to the depot to unload, and then headed back out across the capital to deliver fresh produce to hungry children and adults. He works a 65-hour week –\u0026nbspand has done so since the start of the coronavirus outbreak –\u0026nbspfor no pay.MacNichol is a volunteer for The Felix Project, our Help The Hungry appeal partner. Since lockdown, Felix has quadrupled food deliveries to vulnerable Londoners to a staggering 100,000 meals a day. But they have had to manage this with a small staff of 22 and a 30-fold reduction in volunteers – from 3,500 to just 115 – as many of their volunteers are over 70 and can no longer work due to Covid-19 restrictions.These super volunteers are the backbone for London’s fourth emergency service –\u0026nbspfood provision to the capital’s hungry –\u0026nbspand Felix could not function without them. Today we meet six of them and ask why they joined and what volunteering means to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to support our campaign“Going back 10 years, we were instructed by our bosses at Sainsbury’s to destroy all surplus food, but then the likes of Felix came along and suddenly there was no excuse for waste. I was so impressed by Felix’s operation that I promised to volunteer when I retired. Since coronavirus, I do a 65-hour week. I start at their Park Royal depot, drive to Hello Fresh in Banbury and to Mindful Chef near Birmingham, returning with a two-ton\u0026nbsppayload. Later I deliver to community hubs, charities and schools that have set up food drop centres.“Recently I supplied a school in Ealing and as I arrived one boy said to his friend, “now we’ve got something to eat tonight”, and I thought, bloody hell. To think some parents have to choose between paying rent and feeding their children and that Felix is the only reason they can do both — it brings a lump to your throat.”Retired facilities manager for City officesRuns a fundraising\u0026nbspconsultancy for charities“I came across Felix when it launched in 2016 and was hired to help them raise funds. I promised myself that one day I would go back and volunteer –\u0026nbspand that’s what I did last November. It was amazing to see how Felix had grown into a major lifeline for thousands of Londoners. I thought, incredible growth, incredible impact –\u0026nbspit really does walk the talk. In my job, I see the distress inequality causes, but when I go out in a Felix van, I feel I am doing something good for the community. It might sound schmaltzy but, for me, it’s my war effort.”Economics graduate, works for Cisco Systems“I started volunteering for Felix in January and the thing that struck me when I first walked into their Park Royal warehouse was the unbelievable quantity of food that would otherwise go to waste. It is such a bustling place and since coronavirus, it’s even busier because major suppliers like Hello Fresh and Sainsbury’s have even more surplus food. It’s a boost for my morale to help during lockdown and satisfying to see the smiles on people’s faces as you arrive in the green Felix van.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastLawyer and non-executive director of Investec Wealth“I joined Felix last year because my friend Gary had been there 18 months and loves it, so I went out in the van and got hooked. I started doing one day a week but since coronavirus, I have been doing two full days as a co-driver. It’s hard physical work but it never fails to put a smile on my face. Since lockdown, my partner Rob drives me and today we were on the road for four hours delivering 16 crates of food to six charities and each time we were made to feel like Father Christmas.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A timeline reconstructed by The Independent at the bottom of this\u0026nbsparticle illustrates the way events played out.Over a period of weeks ministers, civil servants, and spokespeople for the government have oscillated between claiming they did not want to take part in the scheme and claiming that they did not do so because of a miscommunication.The UK was also still able to place orders under the scheme well after Downing Street claimed to have missed the deadline.The EU has placed four different tenders for medical equipment since the start of the crisis, three for personal protective equipment (PPE) and one for ventilators. No equipment has yet been delivered under the scheme, but the quantities and timelines for delivery are agreed inidually by member states when they place orders.The programme uses the purchasing power of the 500 million person single market to secure priority orders during a time of a global shortage. The UK is allowed to participate by virtue of being in the Brexit transition period.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Hancock denied the claim soon after at\u0026nbspthe daily Downing Street briefing, which led to Sir Simon withdrawing his comments, explaining\u0026nbspthat he had made them “due to a misunderstanding”.Asked whether anyone had leant on the civil servant to retract his story, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: “It\u0026nbspis important that select committees are given accurate information and that’s why he corrected what he had said. He took the opportunity to correct the record very quickly and in a very clear way.”A European Commission spokesperson said on Wednesday that it had announced as early as\u0026nbsp31 January that help for member states with the organisation of\u0026nbspjoint procurement schemes was forthcoming.“This idea of joint procurement and reporting on the states of the medical supplies of member states was a recurring topic on the agenda of the health security meetings.“So the UK was, as all other members of the health security committee meetings, aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so. Why it did not participate –\u0026nbspthis is obviously something on which we cannot comment.”The timeline of the episode shows how the government handled the situation:British officials attended a meeting in Brussels during which the European Commission said it was ready to help organise the bulk-buying medical equipment using the power of the single market.British officials attended another EU meeting where the commission’s health department said 20 EU countries were ready to join such a scheme for personal protective equipment.British officials attended another meeting where EU officials discussed the addition of ventilators to the procurement scheme.A spokesperson for the commission confirms in public when asked by journalists whether the UK is able to take part in the procurement scheme.The prime minister Boris Johnson is urged by British politicians to join the scheme. In Brussels, the UK takes part in another meeting on joint procurementUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, announces publicly that the commission’s joint procurement initiative had generated “concrete offers of considerable scale at short notice” to supply surgical masks, overalls, goggles, and face shields.Asked in the morning why the UK isn’t taking part in the scheme, a Downing Street spokesperson says: “We are no longer members of the EU.” Boris Johnson is accused off being “ideological” for not taking part.Later in the evening the prime minister’s spokesperson tells Westminster journalists that in fact, a communication error meant the UK had missed the invitation to participate in the schemeAsked why the government did not join the scheme, cabinet minister Michael Gove tells The Andrew Marr Show “there is nothing that we can’t do as an independent nation that being part of that scheme would have allowed us to do” adding that there was “communication confusion”.Matt Hancock tells a Downing Street briefing the UK is working hard opening new supply lines for protective equipment around the world to fill a shortage.The extended deadline for putting orders in the latest round of the EU’s equipment procurement scheme. The UK has placed no orders.Cabinet minister Therese Coffey seems to suggest not going the scheme was a deliberate decision, telling LBC radio: “The government has made an assessment that by joining the schemes, it wasn’t going to make any particular difference.”The Foreign Office’s top civil servant Sir Simon McDonald tells MPs he briefed ministers about the options and that they made a “political decision” not to join the scheme.Later in the afternoon, Matt Hancock tells a daily press briefing “as far as I’m aware there was no political decision not to participate in that scheme ... we are now members of that scheme”.Following the briefing by the health secretary, Sir Simon writes to MPs to retract what he told them.Contrary to what Matt Hancock said the day before, EU officials tell The Independent: “They are not participating in any of the existing schemes but they have indicated that they would be open to participating in any future schemes.”\u0026nbspIn Brussels, a Commission spokesperson refers to the meetings the EU attended and says there was “ample opportunity” to join.\u0026nbsp At a briefing in Westminster, a Downing Street spokesperson says “nobody” leant on Sir Simon to get him to retract his report to MPs.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

During a train stop in China early last year, she was given the job of extinguishing her brother’s cigarette.Some analysts said\u0026nbspthat she has the only real characteristic that matters in the North Korean system – being of the “Paektu blood line”, a direct descendent of the Kim dynasty.But North Korea is also a rigid patriarchy, and her gender would most likely rule her out as anything more than a caretaker leader in the event of her brother’s demise.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSimply put, said\u0026nbspLeif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul: “The North Korean system could not continue in its current ideological and institutional form without an adult male descendant of Kim Il-sung.”Kim Jong-un\u0026nbsphas a surviving older brother, who was passed over for consideration when Kim Jong-il decided which of his children to groom as the country’s next leader.Kim Jong-chol is said to have been more keen on music and playing guitar than politics, and is living a quiet life away from the spotlight in North Korea, according to Thae Yong-ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South.He was last spotted in 2011 enjoying an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore, according to South Korean broadcaster KBS. Like his brother, he also studied abroad in Switzerland.According to Kenji Fujimoto, the Japanese man who claims to have been the personal sushi chef for Kim Jong-il, the late North Korean leader\u0026nbspdecided Kim Jong-chol was too “girlish” to lead the country. It would seem to be a long shot for him to return to the fold of public life.The private life of North Korea’s first family is notoriously shrouded in mystery, but we do know that he has been married to former singer and cheerleader Ri Sol-ju since 2009.South Korea’s intelligence services believe the couple have had three children – including a son born in 2010, a daughter born around 2013 and third child in 2017.Bizarrely, perhaps the best insight into the Kim family came from the 2013 visit of US basketball star Dennis Rodman, who described Kim Jong-un as a “good dad” to his then-young daughter Ju Ae.Created with Sketch.Kim Jong-un: Decade in pictures of North Korean leader Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Kim Jong-un rides a horse during

that a form of regency would be required until his eldest son was old enough to take over.Nonetheless, US officials believe that keeping control of the country within the family is still the most likely outcome. Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, Donald Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien said of any succession: “The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family.”North Korea’s most senior officials have stayed in their jobs through unflinching loyalty to the Kim family, sometimes over multiple generations.In the event that new leadership is required, it is possible that several high-ranking Workers’ Party elders could team up to see the country through any transition.After decades of service including as Kim Jong-un’s first military chief, Choe Ryong-hae rose to be the North’s nominal head of state last year becoming the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly.He and Pak Pong-ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North’s push to introduce more elements of a free market to revive its economy, would be the likely figureheads of any collective leadership.In such a scenario, the former top nuclear envoy Kim Yong-chol and foreign minister Ri Son-gwon could be tasked with handling diplomatic issues including stalled denuclearisation talks with South Korea and Washington, as they played key roles in previous summits with Trump.“Kim now puts his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong in charge of many things, and she is the only sibling and trusted confidante inside his cabinet. Ultimately, though, it is his son who would inherit the kingdom,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public.

On each phone there is an app that reports back to the authorities on the users’ health and online activities.Nor is there any escape in the home. The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health - with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too - though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room. Sadly, it also costs £, so I’ll stick to my ,-piece cheapies. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it’s terrying. I don’t remember much of the next  days.A recent study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, suggests people might experience digestive issues, such as diarrhoea, when they are infected with coronavirus.Researchers analysed data from  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and they discovered that . per cent of these patients arrived at the hospital with digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain.Following this, the researchers stated that, for some people, digestive symptoms may present itself first before the respiratory symptoms of Covid-.The study noted: These data emphasize that patients with new-onset digestive symptoms after a possible Covid- contact should be suspected for the illness, even in the absence of cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or fever.It also explained that patients with digestive symptoms suffered longer than those with respiratory symptoms - citing the average hospital stay as . days.In the study, the people included in the study also had a more severe case of illness.Brennan M.R. Spiegel, co-editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, said: In this study, Covid- patients with digestive symptoms have a worse clinical outcome and higher risk of mortality compared to those without digestive symptoms, emphasising the importance of including symptoms like diarrhoea to suspect Covid- early in the disease course before respiratory symptoms develop.Despite this revelation, people should still be vigilant in looking out for the primary symptoms of coronavirus including a dry cough and high temperature, as well as shortness of breath - as Covid- primarily attacks the lungs and respiratory system.Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose or a sore throat - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.Developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This must be a key consideration.If the Government is going to consider advising the general public to wear facemasks it must fully assess the impact on the NHS.It comes after weeks of debate from experts on whether face masks will have an effect on the spread of the virus or not.The World Health Organizationhas said there is no evidence to support the use of face masks by the general population - and only people in health care settings should use them.From dust masks to homemade coverings with cloth, there are a iety of protection methods popping up as people look for ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Here we take a look at some of the dferent types of face mask and how well they work...N respiratorsN masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers y, but the N is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient.The N stands for Not resistant to oil, because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids while the  means it filters out  per cent of airborne particles.They generally have an -hour shelf le before becoming clogged depending on the work youre doing.As they offer so much protection, they are used by doctors and nurses in a medical setting.However, they have not been recommended for use to the general public yet due to supply issues for health workers.Surgical masksThese disposable -ply masks are fluid-resistant are the most common type of facial protection youll see health care staff wearing.They are used to prevent infected droplets from doctors, nurses and carers entering the respiratory system of the patient.Although they dont have built-in air filters, they are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care.The nose clip can be bent to fit snugly around the nose however they are a loose fit and the material gapes at the sides so they dont protect against all particles.When they become wet, their effectiveness is also reduced.Also, they are disposable and are only intended to be worn once.DIY dust masks Found in most hardware stores, dust masks can offer some level of protection from particles -worn correctly.If it says FFP then it’s a basic kind of dust mask and offers the lowest level of filtration for this kind of respirators mask.To meet European standards, they have to be able to filter at least  per cent of particles - with FFP  filtering  per cent.That means that it can’t filter out tiny particles associated with viruses and bacteria.You can also get a FFP mask, which looks similar but has a small filter in the middle to catch almost all airborne particles.Short of being a full gas mask, it offers the best protection - as long as it fits properly - and is more effective than an N as well as the FFP and FFP.Cycling masksThese are generally worn by cyclists to prevent them from breathing in pollution in heavy traffic.Usually made from neoprene, they fit tightly to the face and are intended to offer a level of protection from airborne particles.Some are also marketed as N, or N grade, which means the amount of filtered airborne particles is either  or  per cent.Homemade masksAs many people cant get their hands on a mask, some have turned to fashioning their own.There have been tips on using vacuum cleaner bags and even sanitary towels to cover your face.While most wont be as effective as anything you can buy in a store, they will offer more protection than not covering your face at all.Research by Public Health England in  looked at the suitability of household materials that could be used as maks to filter bacterial and viral aerosols and found vacuum bags actually worked well.Experts say that you should aim for multiple layers - a double layer of tightly-woven cotton with a thread count of at least  was one of the best barriers, according to researchers in the US.Even a bandana, scarf or T-shirt can be used to cover your nose and mouth while in public. But earlier this week  top doctors called for the public to wear face coverings whenever they leave their home, piling pressure on scientists to change tack.Americans in some states are being told to wear them when they go outside, and people in France will be given them when lockdown measures are eased in the coming weeks.The German state of Saxony has made them compulsory in shops and on public transport, and Spain is giving them out to commuters.Oxford University Professor Trish Greenhalgh, who has published evidence reviewing facemasks said they do help stop the spread of coronavirus.She told The Times: Your mask doesn’t protect you but it protects other people. A mask needs to be an item of clothing.It’s like a T-shirt, wear it and chuck it in the wash. Detergent kills Covid.It is not yet clear how the rules -they are changed - will be enforced.Police have taken a tough stance on enforcing social distancing rules so far which are part of the new laws - but this guidance may fall outside of that.London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Labour boss Sir Keir Starmer, and former PM Tony Blair have both added their voices to the calls for facial coverings and masks.Ministers have been considering for weeks whether to change advice, but have insisted they will be guided by the science.Teachers have also warned they may not go back to school without masks or other PPE to protect them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the first signicant rise since April .Meanwhile, shoppers at The Range in Southampton, Hants, were seen loading up with supplies - some which could be deemed non-essential - to help keep them occupied while they stay at home.Some shoppers were seen bringing trolley loads of gardening materials, plants and compost back to their cars as Britain basks in warm weather.DIY tools, blower vacuums to clean away leaves, paint and other non-essential items were also snapped up by fed-up Brits as the country tries to keep busy under the governments stay-at-home rules.Chris Whitty today admitted that lockdown measures will be needed until the end of the year to control coronavirus - until a drug or a vaccine is round.The Chief Medical Officer said that some form of the measures Britain is going to have to be in place for a long period of time to make sure the transmission rate doesnt grow and begin toIt was wholly unrealistic to think ato normal le is possible anytime soon, Mr Whitty told the Downing Street press conference this evening.There will be a series of choices and ministers will decide a mix of measures to try and get back to a new normal.The only exit from lockdown will be a vaccine or drugs to treat coronavirus, he said.Strict social distancing measures introduced last month to help tackle the spread of the deadly bug say Brits should only leave home to shop for basic necessities like food or medicine.But there is confusion at guidance on what is a reasonable excuse to leave your home during the UKs Covid- shutdown.On March , Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered all non-essential shops to shut while urging Brits to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus.The government is now under pressure to explain to Brits how and when the coronavirus lockdown will end.Under the rules, people can only leave home for a limited number of reasons:The Cabinet is now said to be split into “doves and hawks” over how and when to end the UK-wide shutdown, which is ravaging the countrys economy.Some ministers are said to be against ending the lockdown too early to avoid a second wave, while others want to lt it to avoid a bigger economic crisis.And guidance from senior police leaders issued last week on what is permitted has confused many.The National Police Chiefs Counciland College of Policings three-page document laid out reasonable excuses to leave home.They advised that buying paint and brushes, simply to redecorate a kitchen was not likely to be reasonable.But the advice, which is to help police officers interpret the lockdown rules, says buying tools and supplies  to repair a fence  is likely to be reasonable.To make things more complicated, the guidance says there is no need for all a persons shopping to be basic food supplies.It also states a person has a reasonable excuse to visit the shops that remain open to customers under the Regulations.The guidance was quietly introduced last week after a woman was arrested for sitting on a park bench, claiming she was exercising mentally.It ruled out sitting on park benches for any extended periods of time.Some parks have already taped them up to stop people from sitting in the park and relaxing.Brits are allowed to sit down for a moment to catch their breath or eat their lunch, but onlythey are on a long walk.A short walk to a park bench, when the person remains seated for a much longer period is not considered reasonable, the rules say.The new guidance come after accusations of over-zealous policing of Brits. Downing Street slapped down policing tactics, saying stores are “free to sell what they stock” after officers from Cambridge Police patrolled “non-essential aisles” for shoppers.A police force had to apologise after one of its officers told a family they couldnt use their own front garden.Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley was forced to backtrack after saying cops could start to marshal supermarkets and check the items in baskets.He said the public had enjoyed a three-week grace period and said his force would slap fines and arrest those caught outside for non-essential reasons.He said: We will not, at this stage, be setting up road blocks.We will not, at this stage, start to marshal supermarkets and check the items in baskets and trolleys to see whether its a necessary item.But be under no illusion,people do not heed the warnings and the pleas Im making today, we will start to do that.Home Secretary Priti Patel has repeatedly refused to give in to police chiefs demands for even more power, saying earlier this week they already had enough measures for enforcement.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

three tenders under the scheme had already been sent out with Britain not included.A fourth, for lab kit, was issued the same day but the UK didnt take part in that either.But despite this British officials still missed another crucial gathering on March  at which the Commission put out a call for requests for additional joint procurement of kit.Under the scheme EU countries are ordering £.billion of PPE like gloves, gowns, and eye protectors, and up to £million worth of ventilators.None of the equipment has yet arrived, but contracts with most suppliers have been signed meaning Member States can now submit orders.EU officials expect the first batches of personal protection kit to be delivered next month.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL

First, the EU scheme has spectacularly failed to deliver anything.Indeed — as I suggest below — the EU is coming apart at the seams over this virus.And second, the invitation to join the scheme was sent, by those EU genii, to the wrong address. Duh.It is becoming more apparent with every day that passes that the civil service is the biggest impediment to the UK reforming itself.It is hostile to the Government, to the people — and deeply hostile to change of any kind.It is a vast congregation of time-serving bureaucrats dedicated only to saving their own jobs.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEven now, red tape may be stling our efforts to deal with the coronavirus.It will be interesting to discover, once this pandemic has receded, what part the civil service played in the UK’s failure to carry out adequate testing for the virus, right from the start.And the failure to bring in vital equipment.Government ministers carry the can for these sorts of failures, of course.But it is the civil service charged with enacting the decisions.I wonder how many ventilators have failed to arrive here because of some bureaucratic hitch I wonder what would have happenedthe civil service, rather than the military, were charged with building those Nightingale hospitals.They might just about be ready by the end of the century.It was clear, when this Government came to office, that the real opposition wasn’t the ragged hounds and trots on the Labour benches, but from the very people paid to enable the government — the civil service.There needs to be a clear-out, from the top down.Because this battle — between civil servants and Government ministers — will continue long after this virus has been defeated.Their opposition to Government policy hampers almost everything we do.That’s no way to run a country.I see The Vicar Of Dibley is back.

Why Professor of Law Elizabeth Bartholet said: “It’s always dangerous to put powerful people in charge of the powerless.”.She added that it gave parents “authoritarian control” over the kids.You mean like the authoritarian control they’ve had from the teachers all these years, love It’s comforting to know that even in this crisis, the liberals are still as deranged as ever.You’ve got to feel sorry for Victoria Beckham, haven’t you Poor woman says that last week was the worst of her le.She’s bitterly disappointed with you, the British people.She thinks we were all terribly arsey about her when she decided to use our money to furlough her fashion company workers.How could we be so mean as to expect a woman who has an estimated wealth of £million – acquired largely through singing badly – should dig into her own pockets.Rather than scrounging off the taxpayer.The stinking rich really don’t get it, do they No self awareness whatsoever – and even less shame.But then never mind the witless Posh, whose useless company loses millions every year.Look at old beardo Branson – Sir Richard, entrepreneur and “philanthropist”.He wants YOU to pay HIM £million to bail out his airline, Virgin.This is a man who has paid not a single penny of income tax in the UK for fourteen years.But when his company is in trouble he expects you to bail him out.And this from a bloke who has already been coining it from the taxpayer for his awful rail franchises.This kind of bare-faced cheek almost beggars belief.Or there’s Apple boss Tim Cook boasting about sending a few safety masks to the UK.SO kind of you, Tim.Now how about your company pays its proper share of tax in the UK  Then we might not need your charity.Pope Francis has pleaded with the EU for countries to “come together” to fight the virus.Ha. Fat chance, your Popeship.The European Union is falling apart as a consequence of this crisis.All the member states have been doing the sensible thing – and ignoring everything the EU bureaucrats have to say.Germany introduced very tough anti-immigration measures, for example.But the EU has been criticised for abandon- ing Spain and Italy.There are big rows over a joint debt fund to help the worst-hit countries.There are arguments over what phone app should be used to track virus carriers.One leading European economist said that the EU was in danger of “imploding”.Ah well – every cloud, huh I CAN’T get to my usual snippers in Saltburn.

The former Chancellor, now editor of the London Evening Standard, said a formal stand-in taking over all of Mr Johnson’s decision-making would avoid a power vacuum at the top of government. Currently First Secretary of State Dominic Raab is deputising for the Prime Minister while he recovers at his country retreat of Chequers. Number  insist Mr Raab has the authority to take decisions while Mr Johnson is incapacitated. But Mr Osborne said that was not enough, and it should be made into a formal position. He told BBC Radio  Live’s Emma Barnett: “In our system the prime minister makes all the important and dficult decisions others don’t want to make. That is nature of the job. “We all want Boris Johnson to recover and we hope he is back. “If he is going to be out for a prolonged period then Dominic Raab does need to be the acting PM – not just the deputy who stands in when PM is on a foreign trip. “This is dferent. I certainly agree that you can’t rely on the health and recuperation of one person before you make decisions about the health and recuperation of a country of  million people. “We need decision making at the highest level. If he can’t do it  - and I hope he can – buthe can’t then his acting PM needs to make those decisions.” Mr Osborne said he was spending the lockdown in a ‘borrowed’ house in Somerset. “I’m actually in Somerset in a house that someone has kindly lent me because my children are also in Somerset and I went through a orce recently and I’m near them.  “I need to see them in a way that’s safe and keeps family as in touch as possible. It’s the kind of dilemmas everyone is facing.” The ex-Chancellor warned the furlough scheme may have to be in place for most of this year.

But Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned we may still have to socially distance for the rest of the year. It came as Labour leader Keir Starmer took the Government apart for its failure to provide enough PPE and Covid- testing. In an upbeat address from No, Mr Raab said: “There’s certainly light at the end of the tunnel, there is a glimmer, but we’re not there yet. Thataposs why the measures we introduced must remain in place for the time being. The greatest risk for us now,we eased up on our social distancing rules too soon, is that we would risk a second spike in the virus with all the threats to le that would bring and then the risk of a second lockdown which would prolong the economic pain we are all going through.

Former UK Government adviser Daniel Sleat and Ryan Wain are two of the authors of The Path to Mass Testing, a report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. It  a blueprint for how contact tracing can bring countries out of lockdown.Here they write exclusively in the Mirror and discuss the only way the UK could ease its coronavirus lockdown before a vaccine is found - something which it was warned today could be many, many months away.The Government has two choices. Remain in lockdown and suppress Covid- or leave lockdown and contain the virus. We believe that containment is possible but only through mass testing and tracing. This means millions of us being tested regularly and – should we test positive – being isolated along with those who have come into contact with us. This is a huge operation. Perhaps the biggest in peacetime.  So when Matt Hancock set a target of , tests a day, it was ambitious but only the start of what needs to be done. The truth is we will need much higher numbers of tests available and an army of people to deliver them. We will need technology that doesn’t yet exist in Britain.  Testing figures need to be much higher and accompanied by the right strategy on which groups the Government intends to roll out testing to. We can look abroad for inspiration. The Germans can test , per week and in South Korea they flattened their infection curve through mass community testing and contact tracing.  They were prepared better than the UK. It’s critical that the structure of government changes during these extraordinary times. Testing is so important that a senior Minister should oversee it, reporting directly to the Prime Minister and have a team of the brightest minds from outside politics who are experts in procurement, logistics and scaling big projects. They should have the authority to find every inch of laboratory space in the country and use it for testing. That’s what the renowned Robert Koch Institute did in Germany. Finally, the government has shted its gaze from antibody tests.

Buthe had, I doubt it would have been like this. He squared up against Boris Johnson’s stand-in, Dominic Raab, in a mostly empty Commons chamber, while most MPs chimed in on webcams. Andyou thought Starmer’s PMQ’s debut would be a nerve-wracker, spare a thought for Lindsay Hoyle - presiding over the first ‘virtual’ PMQs. On top of his usual job refereeing the clash of leaders, Sir Lindsay was in charge of making sure MPs were all fully dressed. Or at least that their laptop cameras were positioned so as not to reveal their missing trousers. The whole thing had an air of a phone in interview on a Saturday morning kids show in the s, with Sir Lindsay playing a young Sarah Greene or Philip Schofield. “And now we’re going to go to Peter in Wellingborough,” he almost said. “Peter, are you there  What’s your question for the First Secretary.” Starmer, for his part, set the tone early on - staying on top of the detail and reacting to the answers he was given. He opened by quizzing Johnson’s understudy on the government’s increasingly optimistic pledge to perform , coronavirus tests every day, noting with admirable restraint that we’re “behind the curve” delivering just , a day with just  days to go.  Raab, who looks like what might happenBruce Banner was interrupted halfway through turning into the Incredible Hulk, reared up for a spot of goalpost repositioning. He tried to ‘correct’ the new leader, noting testing capacity was now more than , - well on its way to the promised hundred grand. But ever the former lawyer, Starmer ed to his feet, reminding Raab that the pledge wasn’t about capacity, it was about tests performed. It was the kind of on-the-spot reaction that Ministers hate and which Jeremy Corbyn used to struggle with so much - the former leader instead relying on pre-prepared questions that played well in social media clips.  Speaking of Starmer’s predecessor, Mr Corbyn took his seat on the back benches in person, steadfastly refusing to ‘phone it in’ with most other MPs despite so many years of practice. Quite why Mr Corbyn keeps insisting on turning up to Parliament in person, like Banquo looking for a sandwich, rather than staying home and stroking El Gato escapes me. Unless of course he’s cursed with a slow internet connection, which perhaps raises questions about his election pledge to provide free super fast Broadband for every household. Raab, whose broad, muscular neck would make a perfectly good measuring stick for social distancing rules, managed not to screw anything up or get noticeably rattled. The ever-present vein on his forehead pulsed, but didn’t burst. He even managed to get most of the numbers right - despite not being able to put his hand on the number of care home workers who have sadly died of the virus.

In the  hours to am Tuesday, just , out of possible , tests were carried out. That means only % of available capacity was used. The first of four mobile test units was expected to operational by tomorrow. No confirmed its goal remained to carry out , tests a day by next Thursday . The PMaposs spokesman said: “We are making progress in increasing the capacity but we do need to ensure that we are making full use of it.”First Secretary Dominic Raab, standing in for Boris Johnson at Prime Ministeraposs Questions, admitted the Government needed an “exponential increase” in testing to hit its target.Mr Raab told MPs: “In the final week that will require a big increase. But, of course, with a project like this, it does require an exponential increase in the final days and the final week of the programme.  Keir Starmer tore into the Governmentaposs testing plan for NHS workers, saying it was flawed with an obvious problem. In his first Commons outing as Labour leader, Mr Starmer said: If a care worker has symptoms of coronavirus or a family member has symptoms, he or she has to self-isolate, quite rightly.“To get a necessary test, they are then instructed to travel to a testing centre, which is often very many miles away.” He added: “Thereaposs an obvious problem with that system – not all care workers will have access to a car, because theyaposve got symptoms or family members have got symptoms they obviously canapost use public transport, so it is little wonder weaposre seeing these pictures of half-empty testing centres.” Shadow Health Minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, an accident and emergency doctor, tweeted: The Government needs to ensure the number of tests carried out reaches , per day by the end of April. “Capacity is irrelevantitaposs not used. We canapost get a grip on the coronavirus crisis without understanding how widespread the pandemic is. In a statement to the Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said demand for tests was lower than expected. He said: Iaposve set the goal of , tests a day by the end of this month and Iaposm delighted to say that the expansion of capacity is ahead of plans, even though demand has, thus far, been lower than expected.  We are therefore ramping up the availability of this testing and expanding who is eligible for testing, and making it easier to access the tests. Health workersapos leaders called for volunteers to be mobilised so tests could increase. Unison union general secretary Dave Prentis said: “Clearly ministersapos strategy isn’t working, despite checks being vital in winning the fight against Covid. “We need to get tests to staff, not expect them to attend test centres. “There has to be a better way of taking testing to staff on the frontline. “It’s not sensible to expect poorly iniduals to travel miles from home to be swabbed. “That could mean several hours’ drive for some living in remote areas, which is totally unrealistic. “People also need to be tested within days of the onset of symptoms. “It’s no surprise take up has been so low. The Government must make it easier for staffthere’s to be any possibility of meeting its, a day goal. “We want to work with the government to identy how to use the help of the army of volunteers who’ve signed up to assist the NHS. “Many have yet to be given anything to do. They could be mobilised to take kits to NHS and care workers.” The boss of one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies said the UK was struggling to ramp up testing because the Government had failed to spend enough cash on healthcare “over many years”.  Roche chief executive Severin Schwan told BBC Newsnight: “You canapost fix the infrastructure in a couple of weeks. “If there is too little investment over many years into the health care system, then itaposs simply not possible to ramp up as fast as you would wish in such a challenging situation.

While First Secretary of State Dominic Raab warned that the country is not out of the woods yet and that any loosening of the measures could put people at risk.Professor Whitty explained: In the long run the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally – a vaccine, and there are a iety of ways they can be deployed... and or highly-effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease eventhey catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people. Until we have those – and the probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small, and I think we should be realistic about that – weaposre going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive as everyone is finding at the moment.

The slowdown in infection rates prompted Dominic Raab to claim there is now a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. This is a tribute to all our NHS staff but also to the way the country has stoically accepted the social distancing restrictions. But we have to accept there is still a long way to go. The Government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said there is an incredibly small chance of developing an effective vaccine within the next calendar year. This implies we may have to weather the economic and social turbulence for longer than had been hoped. This will be especially challenging for those who are having to self-isolate. And families will be worried about schooling and finances. Which is why it is all the more important ministers are candid about what lies ahead. It is also essential the Government raises its game when it comes to supporting those working on the front line. Each day staff are placing their lives at risk because of a shortage of protective kit. The Government says it is doing everything it can. But this does not ring true when we learned yesterday that at least three dozen firms had reached out to offer to manufacture supplies only for their offer to fall on deaf ears. Labour leader Keir Starmer got it right in his impressive debut at Prime Minister’s ­Questions. There is a pattern, he said, which has seen the Government being too slow to bring in the lockdown, too slow on testing and too slow on protective equipment. NHS staff, carers, volunteers, the Armed Forces, unions and business have stepped up to the plate. It is time for ministers to do so.

Some brilliant and unusual artwork has been created to honour the Second World War veteran. Capt Tom, who turns  next week, has raised £million for the NHS by completing  laps of his garden in Marston Moretaine, Beds, with the help of his walking frame. Nine-year-old Olivia-Mae Cash and dad Craig, of Horncastle, Lincs, used over  balloons to create a le-size model of the ex-Army officer. The duo, whose masterpiece took three hours, said they “wanted to spread some smiles like Capt Tom”. They weren’t the only ones who dug deep – one creation was made from mud. Ricky Minns, of Norfolk, who creates artwork under the name Ruddy Muddy, fashioned his grimy tribute on the back of a van. Capt Tom has been going the extra mile in his native Yorkshire. Graeme Bandeira, cartoonist for the Yorkshire Post, drew him and the image ended up on a bus there. Capt Tom was born and raised in Keighley. Nathan Wyburn, of Ebbw Vale, in Blaenau Gwent, also used his feet.  He said: “He’s captured the nation’s hearts... by walking round his garden. I wanted to replicate it by using footprints and walking through paint.” Northampton artist Sam Bailey used over  epaulettes donated by emergency services staff to create a ft-tall tribute. And a mural has appeared on a pub in Pontefract, West Yorks, thanks to Rachel List.

Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Bill Chandi, who is in charge of the local post office, told the  Bedford Independent : In all my years as a Post Master, I’ve never seen anything like this. We’re ecstatic for Tom. Whenever he used to pop into our shop he’d always say to me that post offices are at the centre of the community. I spoke to him on Saturday and told him that’s certainly true now. Captain Moore was guest of honour at the opening ceremony of the NHS Nightingale Hospital Yorkshire and the Humber, in Harrogate, and appeared by video link in front of a crowd of around  people.Sitting with his daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, at his home in Bedfordshire, he said: Iaposm absolutely in awe of what has happened. If you think all the kindness of the people in this country and throughout the world, who have given so much money to the fund to help our National Health Service, which you have got to agree is one of the best services that there is in the world. He continued: All the doctors and nurses in the NHS, they do a brilliant job in very dficult conditions and every day theyaposre putting themselves in harmaposs way night and morning.  Theyaposre doing it with a determination that only we can do and they are continuing to do that and I think we must all say thank you very much to the National Health Service, all of you, not just the doctors and nurses, but everyone throughout the whole system who are doing such a magnicent job. Asked about his native Yorkshire, Captain Tom said: I believe that thereaposs no place better than Yorkshire. There never has been and all the people who are missing coming to Yorkshire, theyaposre missing an awful lot of marvellous things and people, because the Yorkshire people have a sense of humour and kindness that not many people have, to the extent that we have.

As a person, he was the best friend you could wish for, always smiling, calm and easy going, and an avid Palace fan. As a colleague, he was extremely professional, reliable, approachable, highly experienced and knowledgeable, and always ready to help. He was the complete package and an absolute joy to work with. Our pitch-side medical team will not be the same without Ian. Dr Pakravan said Ian is survived by his we and two sons, one of whom will continue his dadaposs work as a member of the pitch-side stretcher crew.Ianaposs newphew, Dan Powell, wrote on Facebook : Very very sad day yesterday the loss of uncle Ian to covid-, will be sadly lost as a uncle, husband, dad, brother and paramedic, my heart goes out to the rest of the family.Garrett Emmerson, chief executive of the London Ambulance Service speaking on LBC today said:This is obviously heartbreaking news and we have had very little time to get used to it because up until yesterday afternoon we were hoping for a better outcome.  We are all just devastated. We are losing people we have known and loved and worked with for a number of years.

The depth of these problems will fatally undermine any progress on getting this network up and running. “Patients are taking matters into their own hands, while desperate colleagues shop around for scuba gear in a bid to keep themselves safe.  It is time for a genuinely national effort to get PPE to the NHS front line. No health professional should have to risk becoming a super spreader simply to eke out supplies. The authorities should not be putting dentists, their families or patients in harm’s way.”  Speaking about the use of scuba ing masks, a BDA spokesman told : They simply don’t have enough FFP masks left, and the only other option is cancelling urgent cases. Nearly two thirds of dentists at urgent care centres in England have reported shortages of Face Filtering Protection masks - the highest quality - and gowns. The BDA has previously warned of a spike in aposDIY dentistryapos as a result of the closure of clinics across the country. Dentists have also slammed the Government over the slow roll-out of urgent care centres, which they claim left whole regions without access to urgent care.

The major roads are not back to normal, but the photos do show a steady stream of traffic. This apparent upturn comes despite non-essential journeys still being outlawed, with police forces able to collar and fine those who venture out without a proper purpose. On April  - Easter Sunday - traffic on UK roads fell to just % of pre-lockdown levels, according to data from the Department of Transport. A week later however, and that figure had risen to % - equivalent to the highest number of daily journeys than since the lockdown began. As well as lockdown fatigue, the reason for these extra trips may be to do with the increasing number of destinations on offer.  Stores including BQ, Nandos and Burger King have begun to remove the mothballs and fire up their tills again. BQ carried out a trial reopening of  stores over the weekend, in order to try out whether social distancing measures could be followed. Today it was announced that a further  outlets would be reopened, with two metre floor marking throughout the building and clear guards in front of the cashiers desks. BQ is not the only business which has reopened. KFC has opened the doors of  of its restaurants, for delivery only, and with staff having to volunteer to work.  The restaurants are in Aldershot, Birmingham, Glasgow, Ipswich, London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Stockport, and Tamworth. Nandos has also reopened four shops - four in London, two in Manchester and one in Dublin. The chicken business is putting its peri-peri expertise to good use by providing , free meals to key workers each day. Burger King is also tentatively warming up its engines after a month of being closed.  The fast food giant has reopened two restaurants in Bristol, one in Coventry and one in Swindon. Staff will wear masks and gloves to cook food, which will be delivery only. While it is offering a parred-back menu with % of the usual items, it is donating , meals to NHS staff a week. The royal patty provider is not the only burger shop up and running either. Five Guys is opening a further seven stores, adding to the  that remained open during the lockdown.  The reopening of parts of Britainaposs hospitality sector comes despite the fact that most journeys are still outlawed. Police are issuing fixed penalty charges to anyone they consider to be away from their homes without good reason, with £ for a first offence and £ for a second.  Yesterday Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, warned that the country was by no means out of the danger zone yet at the Downing Street press conference. For the past week and a half the number of new cases confirmed daily in the UK was between , and ,, with only the earliest hints that the infection curve was falling.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said there was #xCrelatively low confidence#xD that a shipment of , surgical gowns which had been due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday would make its way into the country on Monday.

Its chief executive, Niall Dickson, said: #xCIt would have been better had the Government not made the announcement in the first place#xD and said staff would need to make their own assessment over whether they felt safe with the PPE currently on offer. Mr Hopson told Radio #xs Today programme that it was wrong to focus on inidual consignments of PPE because #xCbitter experience over the last few weeks#xD has shown they cannot be relied upon, with some boxes containing the wrong items and thousands of pieces missing. #xCSo rather than being marched up to the top of the hill and being marched back down again, let#xs just focus on what we know we can be certain of,#xD he said. #xCLet#xs not focus on inidual consignments, let#xs try and get as quickly as possible to a sustainable supply of these gowns. #xCThere#xs no doubt that at the moment, we have now got trusts that have definitely got shortages of gowns.#xD Mr Hopson said trusts were reserving the stock of fluid-resistant gowns they do have for areas of high clinical risk, such as intensive care units, and using workarounds in other areas. #xCThere#xs one trust that#xs basically discovered thatyou launder those gowns at  degrees ... there#xs probably up to three times that you can do that, and the gowns appear to still be fully fluid-repellent,#xD he said.

The shower - an annual event from April - - is to peak tonight, producing around  meteors per hour, and people have been sitting out in their gardens accompanied by duvets, hot chocolate and iPhones. At the same time, the billionaire Musk has launched a series of satellites aimed to providing a global internet service and between the two thereaposs been plenty to keep people watching the skies. Shona Moss, , said she and her partner got their six-year-old son out of bed at midnight and within  seconds the most amazing meteor Iaposve ever seen drew an arc across the sky. James Smith said: Man, the Lyrid meteor shower is spectacular and I’ve only been looking  minutes!!While Martina said: What a magical sky tonight! There are plenty of them!! But still waiting for that beautul, bright one, the most beautul Meteor like I saw last night shooting straight above my head! Oh please come on! Another Twitter user said: OMG ITaposS SO BEAUTIFUL. While Jamesh said at around .am: Just spotted an amazing meteor over Milton Keynes! Mesmerising. For some it was a less awe-inspiring experience and more tranquil.Phil Sloman said: Saw one meteor while watching the skies. Very peaceful experience with the sound of Tawny Owls in the nearby woods for accompaniment. Heading to bed now. The Lyrids are one of the oldest known meteor showers, having been observed for over , years.But with much of the world faced with uncertainty during coronavirus lockdown, it seems to have taken on more precedence this year - and people are appreciating the people around them as much whataposs going on in the sky.Brian Hill tweeted: Lovely hour in my back garden in Belfast with my we watching the meteor shower just under the starry plough. Many people pointed out that thanks to less air pollution, due to far fewer people heading out to work each day for the last month, the sky seemed clearer.Added to the meteors was the UFO-like lights also racing through the night sky, but these were not a natural phenomenon: rather a constellation of thousands of satellites designed to provide low-cost broadband internet service. The £ billion Starlink project has seen batches of satellites launched into the orbit  at a time, with a previous launch in late March and another tonight.They have been spotted all week in the UK due to their low Earth orbit, creating plenty of confusion on Twitter between Starlink and the meteor shower.One user with the handle @elliecov expressed her delight at spotting a aposmeteor showerapos, only to be left disappointed. First time I’ve ever seen a meteor shower and my inner child feels fulfilled that I finally got wish upon a shooting star, she tweeted.  However, later when she realised what sheaposd actually seen, she said: I’ve just found out the meteor shower was in fact Starlink satellites realigning and now I’m sad. But others were more impressed by both phenomenon and the chance to see them together. Twitter user Pamela said: Sitting in the garden with my sister with our duvets and a cup of hot chocolate watching the Starlink satellites and Lyrid meteor shower. Have seen   satellites so far in Glasgow, amazing. Love me some stargazing. While Scott Pottie wrote: Me and my  year old son watched them. He was so excited. Peter Laws added: Kids and I lay out in the garden for an hour under duvets and watched the #starlinksattelites. Saw them so clearly. While Han OaposConnor tweeted: Up early tomorrow but cheeky hour or so stargazing well spent. Great to see Starlink satellites, a beautul view of Venus and even lucky enough to see a meteor. The meteors come from leftover particles from Comet C  G Thatcher, and bits from broken asteroids. “When comets come around the sun, they leave a dusty trail behind them, NASA has explained. “Every year the Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky.” "},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancocks coronavirus test plans","story":"NewsMatt Hancocks coronavirus test plans in tatters as only half of checks are doneForeign Secretary Dominic Raab revealed during Prime Ministers Questions today that the UK now had the capacity to test , people a day, despite the fact only half of those were being usedShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video matt-hancock-insists-regular-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news matt-hancocks-coronavirus-test-plans-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Stand-in PM Dominic Raab said the UK now had capacity to test , people a day when grilled during Prime Minister’s Questions. And Health Secretary Mr Hancock has vowed , tests will be carried out from next Friday. But despite his claims the country was “ahead of our trajectory on capacity”, just , tests were conducted in the  hours up to am yesterday. And only , iniduals were actually checked, as poor reliability meant many needed repeat tests. Do you have a coronavirus story to tell  Email webnews@mirror NHS staff and care workers have complained of problems getting appointments for tests. Many also face travelling long distances to drive-through centres often hours away. Official figures show .% of nurses and .% of doctors are absent from work, equivalent to about , staff. But the British Medical Association estimates the true figure is ,. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said problems at test sites meant it was “no surprise” take up was so low. He said: “Almost three weeks ago the Government set a goal of , daily tests. “That was meant to have been by the end of April. “Ministers’ strategy isn’t working, despite checks being vital in winning the fight against Covid. “We need to get tests to staff, not expect them to attend centres. It’s not sensible to expect poorly ­iniduals to travel miles. “That could mean several hours’ drive for some in remote areas.” Drive-through testing sites have been set up at Chessington World of Adventures, and in London, Manchester and Glasgow. Many stood empty in recent days while some had long queues. Currently NHS staff, social carers and some police, council workers and prison officers are eligible. Supermarket workers and transport staff could soon be added to the list of people entitled to tests. Foreign Secretary Mr Raab told the Commons: “Our capacity for tests is at , per day, so that is an incredibly important milestone.”  But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Government was again lagging behind other nations. He said: “There is a pattern emerging here. We were slow into lockdown, slow on testing, slow on protective equipment.” It comes as some European countries are easing lockdown measures. Germany, which has been conducting , daily tests for a month, is assembling contact tracing teams as it lts some restrictions. But Mr Hancock said the UK would introduce contact tracing only once the number of new cases falls. “As we have reached the peak, as we bring the number of new cases down, so we will introduce contact tracing at large scale,” he said. He would not confirm it would be in place for the review of UK ­lockdown in nearly three weeks’ time. That will be the next opportunity the Cabinet has to consider reopening some businesses and easing social distancing measures.  Mr Hancock added: “We are ramping up our testing capacity and our capacity for contact-tracing in a matter of weeks. “We’ll have it ready to make sure we can use that as and when the ­incidence of transmission comes down. It isn’t tied to the specic ­decision that we’re required by law to take in just over two weeks’ time.” Meanwhile thousands of key workers could be sent home-testing kits this week. If the trial is successful, officials hope to make the kits available to all NHS staff next week. Amid fears some infected medics are wrongly being given the all-clear to go to work, a doctors’ union has called on Public Health England to publish more information about the reliability of Covid- tests. Dr Claudia Paoloni, of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, said: “We have long had concerns about the quality of the tests used to judge affected NHS staff ‘fit to work’ and wrote to PHE last week to ask for greater details on their efficiency.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The mysterious vessels, which are waiting to dock at Port Talbot, appeared several days ago and have fuelled re speculation on social media over why they are there, Wales Online reports. Among the theories put forward by residents are that the ships might be carrying reinforcement supplies of items such as toilet roll, which have been bought up by coronavirus panic-buying. Others have suggested that their sudden appearance might be connected to Mondayaposs historic drop in oil prices. The ships are currently anchoring in the Bristol Channel, off the coast of Gower. Curious locals have been taking to Facebook to shed light on what they might be, with some speculating that they could be cruise liners or car carriers. One user commented: Anyone know what ship boat is in the bay this morning  Looks like a cruise ship. Another replied: If it’s the right one I believe it’s a car carrier! Posting on Twitter, another said: The shortage of toilet rolls finally resolved as six ships anchor in the Bristol channel waiting to enter Port Talbot docks. Although it is not clear what cargo the ships are carrying, one of the vessels is registered as an oil tanker. The most eye-catching and weird-looking vessel was the first one that arrived at the weekend.  The -metre long flat-sided vehicle carrier, Mediterranean Highway, is registered in Panama and weighs over , tonnes. The other ships are Whitstar , Golden Eagle , Sagar Samrat , Bulk Enduranceand SSI Excellent . It is not clear how long the ships, which y inbetween  and  metres, will be anchored in the Bristol Channel.

His artwork resulted in a multi colored handprint which has been proudly on display by parents William and Kate in the window of their Norfolk home.  The family have been staying at Anmer Hall during the coronavirus outbreak with the Duke and Duchess taking part in a series of video calls to front line NHS workers and charities giving thanks and praise on behalf of the British public.

The  year-old former rapper – once pictured in Syria holding a severed head – was smuggled into Spain by boat from Algeria using a  Algerian passport a few days before being snatched in a massive police raid. Sources have revealed the twisted fanatic was disguised as an undocumented migrant and had travelled to the city of Almeria, South East Spain, in a motorised boat from North Africa. It is feared his reappearance after five years on the run could mean he is the vanguard of more Brits who disappeared off the counter-terror radar, who want to attack Europe. A British former military intelligence officer told the Daily Mirror: “It is possible he won’t be extradited back to the UKhis citizenship has been removed in his absence.“But of urgent concern is whether Britain knew Bary was en route for Spain andnot, was he heading for the UK to further Islamic State’s intent of launching attacks “It is well known that foreign fighters like this person were advised, when Daesh territory was being attacked, that they shouldto their homelands and plot assaults of any kind.”One aspect of the investigation MI counter-terror officers will want to know isBary had a support base still in the UK andso who these people are,they are not known to them already. Bary had only been in Spain for a “few days” according to sources, along with two henchmen and all three acted astrying to avoid police surveillance. They rented a small apartment and were arrested by armed police at am while they were in their beds sleeping. Spanish police have celebrated the high-profile arrest as ending the hunt for “one of Europe’s most wanted foreign terrorist fighters.” In the raid on Monday Bary was seen being led out of his Almeria city centre apartment – along with two other men – with a jacket over his head.  The terrorist was once a key suspect in the hunt for Jihadi John, real name was Mohammed Emwazi, and both men were brought up in West London. Spain’s National Police refer to Bary as being of Egyptian origin leading to the suspicion his British nationality may have been removed by the Home ­Secretary, currently Priti Patel.He was born in Egypt but moved to the UK as a six-year-old after his father was released from prison and applied for political asylum with his we and family.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

Tiger Lily Boutique, Signature Menswear, Vanity Studio and Linton  Mac are all taking part in the virtual event, offering discounts and hair and make-up tutorials online.The Virtual May Day will also aim to raise funds for Mental Health Aberdeen and NHS Grampian’s Endowment fund, which provides comfort boxes containing treats, snacks and toiletries for staff and patients in hospitals in the north-east, as well as fund local research into coronavirus.

It was an inauspicious start.In the end, it was a point on the board, but perhaps a fortunate one, with Leigh Grfiths close to beating Reds keeper Jamie Langfield from range to win it.Here#s what McInnes had to say after his new side failed to score for the th league game that season: “It’s my task to find a way for Aberdeen to win on a more regular basis – and I will do that.“The performance and result against Hibs simply showed why we are where we are in the table at the moment. We are just an okay team right now and we have to be better than that.“Everyone knows Aberdeen have been dficult to play against at times.“We need to keep that side of the game with us.“But we must also get the balance right between being tough to beat as well as being more of an attacking threat.“I’m looking for a wee bit more craft, composure and guile.“I will be asking the players why we didn’t do more to try to win the Hibs game.“Our preparation was geared towards doing that but we never took that into the match.“We failed to utilise the good pace we had up front and it’s clear there is a lot of work to be done.#The new boss# assessment wasn#t wide of the mark, with Aberdeen managing just one shot on target that night. Keeper Langfield was the EE#s top man, which is never a good sign.McInnes also laid down the gauntlet to the Dons squad to show him whether they deserved to be at the club for the following season.In the Evening Express the following day, chief football writer Sean Wallace said it hadn#t taken the Reds long to show their new boss the root of their struggles during the earlier campaign.He wrote: #This game proved Derek McInnes’ rebuilding of the Dons will take time.#The draw underlined it will be no overnight fix to revive a team that has finished in the bottom six for four consecutive seasons.#The problems that have hindered Aberdeen all season were still there at Easter Road.#There is still an inability to score coupled with a lack of flair and creativity.#That will have hammered home to McInnes the need to find a prolic striker to partner Niall McGinn # and the need to find players to provide the ammunition for the#It would be unrealistic after two weeks of training under McInnes for a side that has won just  in  SPL games to be remarkably transformed.#The major changes will come next season.#This was more about subtle changes – a higher tempo with more directness of play and less hesitancy.#McGinn and Jonny Hayes also consistently worked short corners, alternating with the delivery.#Of course, the following January, the #prolic striker# needed arrived in Adam Rooney, who would score a penalty to seal the League Cup at March and score at least  in the three seasons following  .His near-telepathic link with wingers Hayes and McGinn, who had been a striker under Brown, the key to Aberdeen finding consistent attacking verve.Aside from the League Cup and Scottish Cup semi-final in  , they#d finish third and get back into Europe, staying in Continental competition ever since.Perhaps the best reflection of the upturn in performances is that on April ,  # four years after first taking charge # he was beating Hibs at Hampden to lead the Reds into the third domestic cup final of his tenure.They were runners-up in the Scottish Cup that season to Celtic, of course, as they were in the League Cup and Premiership, which has been the way of things for most of McInnes# tenure."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped.

with Cool FM, Mrs Foster said the executive is also set to provide more clarity on the controversial issue over whether people should be able to travel to take part in exercise.But she ruled out the introduction of a distance restriction ndash such as the km in operation in the Irish Republic ndash to ensure people exercised locally.The impact of coronavirus has not been as severe in Northern Ireland as other parts of the UK. The region had recorded  deaths in the pandemic by Wednesday.vw,vw,px, px\"Social distancing restrictions are in place in Northern Ireland for at least another two weeks The First Minister was asked whether the contrasting experiences meant Northern Ireland may move away from the restrictions at a dferent pace from worse hit parts of the UK.ldquoIt will be led by the criteria that will be set down and agreed by ourselves in the Northern Ireland Executive in conjunction with the our colleagues in the other parts of the UK, she told Cool FM.ldquoAnd because of that you could well see dferent parts of the United Kingdom move in dferent time to other parts, because it will be criteria-led.ldquoWhat do I mean by that ndash we will have to look at the amount of admissions to hospital, the admissions to intensive care units, the number of deaths we have, what it means for us in terms of the science.ldquoWe have a scientic advisory group in London that advises and then we also have our own advisory group here in Northern Ireland and our own chief medical officer.ldquoSo they will be looking at all of that information, all of the data we collect in Northern Ireland, we will bring that together and then wersquoll look at it that way.Earlier on Wednesday, Health Minister Robin Swann said the decisions around restrictions would be primarily based on what the scientic evidence base was in Northern Ireland.At the daily Covid- briefing he was asked whether the region should be part of an all-island exit strategy with the Irish Republic, given the shared land border.ldquoItrsquos important that we take our scientic guidance based on the science that is applicable to Northern Ireland, he said.Chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said he and officials were in close contact with colleagues south of the border.ldquoThere is no doubt that we share a common land mass with our close colleagues and neighbours in the Republic of Ireland and that is something that we will closely need to consider, he said.ldquoAnd I think the other thing which I would point out is that the virus on this island in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is behaving very similarly and dferent to other parts of the United Kingdom.In the interview, Mrs Foster also said the executive intended to offer more clarity on how far people can travel from home to take part in exercise.Police have been accused to going beyond the rules set by emergency legislation by telling people that they cannot drive to a location away from their home for exercise.Officers have insisted they are working in line with legal advice and do use discretion when appropriate.Mrs Foster said the executive would discuss the issue on Friday. She said she realised there were people, such as those living in cities, who did need to travel a short distance to exercise.ldquoI know there has been some ambiguity about that and the executive are looking at this matter again and will be giving more clarity in relation to all of that before the weekend, she said.Askedministers would consider setting a distance limit similar to the km measure in the Irish Republic, she said: ldquoI wouldnrsquot be in favour of putting a restriction like that on because there are many people who live in the city and they may have to travel a longer distance

resources during a pandemic, an academic has said.In a debate on whether it is wrong to prioritise younger patients with coronavirus, Arthur Caplan, Professor of Bioethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York, argued that age is a ldquovalid criterion when supported by data.Writing in the BMJ on Wednesday, Prof Caplan said age had played a role for decades in limiting access to care when rationing le-saving treatments, such as access to renal dialysis and organ transplants.But he said that even in conditions of extreme scarcity ldquoit would be discriminatory to simply invoke age to exclude those in need from services.Prof Caplan said that the key ethical question was whether age by itself was ever a ldquomorally relevant factor in deciding who gets care when rationing is unavoidable.However,the goal is to save the most lives with scarce resources, then age may matterthere is a diminishing chance of survival with increased age, he added.vw,vw,px, px\"A simulation technician takes part in medical training inside a ward at the official opening of the new Dragonrsquos Heart Hospital, built at the Principality Stadium, Cardf Prof Caplan said: ldquoIndeed, the relevance of old age as a predictive factor of efficacy mdash combined with the powerful principle of healthcare affording equality of opportunity to enjoy a le mdash makes age an important factor in making the terrible choice of who will receive scarce resources in a pandemic.ldquoAgeism has no place in rationing, but age may.But Dave Archard, Emeritus Professor at Queenrsquos University in Belfast, said that there were three reasons why age should not be used to decide who should and should not receive potentially le-saving treatment.He said that a simple ldquoyounger than criteria was unsatisfactory because it cannot be said an -year-old is preferred to a -year-old on the grounds of one yearrsquos dference in age.This would be not much better morally than tossing a coin, or a crude ldquofirst come, first served principle using the time of arrival at a hospital to determine whether care is given, he added.Prof Archard said that while the ldquofair innings argument ndash that everyone should have an opportunity to lead a le of a certain duration ndash had intuitive appeal, there was no agreement of what a fair innings amounted to.He added: ldquoSomeone who has had her fair innings may yet have much to give the world than another, who has not, may be unable to offer.To discriminate between patients in the provision of care on the grounds of age is to send a message about the value of old people, he said.Prof Archard said that such discrimination publicly expresses the view that older people are of lesser worth or importance than young people.ldquoAnd it would be hard

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related.

As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance.

Very slowly beat in the caster sugar. I do this one teaspoon at a time to ensure the air stays in the mixture. When all the sugar has been added, mix the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour and then beat into the meringue. Rather than using a baking sheet lined with parchment I use a ceramic pie dishand oil very lightly. I serve the pavlova in this dish so it looks pretty and stops the chances of the meringue breaking. Fill the dish with thick scoops of the mixture to form the pavlova shape and bake in a preheated oven for  minutes then turn off the oven and leave for a further  minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved. Cook for about  or  minutes, stirring to ensure the mixture doesnt burn. Cool and then sieve the seeds to make a coulis and add the strawberries to the coulis.

This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people.

Itrsquos time for Westminster to wake up to the huge potential that these changes unleash and commit to reforming the Commons for good, she added.As a small number of MPs debated the motion the chamber had black and yellow taping on the floor and seats were marked with a no-entry sign or a tick to show where they could sit, ensuring they kept to the two-metre social distancing rule.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons Leader, told MPs said the new digital Parliament might not be perfect and technical glitches were likely to occur but he insisted: ldquoWe must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\"Mr Rees-Mogg explained that he expected to bring forward further motions shortly so MPs could extend the virtual ways of working for a longer period and to ldquomore substantive business including legislation.Karen Bradley, who chairs the Commons Procedure Committee, pointed out it had not looked thoroughly at remote voting, noting how ldquosome others have tried the trial run of it and cant say it was absolutely brilliant. A lot more work will need to be done\".Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle pointed out no decision had yet been taken with regards to voting and that any considerations to do so would be ldquocompletely checked\" before being implemented.In exchanges, Labourrsquos John Spellar said the Commons had to be the \"epicentre of the democratic system\" and its role scaled-up in the coming weeks to ensure questions are answered by ministers, noting: \"Otherwise, what is the point of Parliament \"Tory backbencher Sir Desmond Swayne, commenting on the limiting of numbers in the chamber, claimed it would be \"outrageous\"MPs were excluded from debates.\"This is the precedent that were now setting and it would be outrageousmembers elected to this House were unable to come and bring their concerns to this chamber because there were already a sufficient number of members within it,\" he said.Meanwhile, the House of Lords held its first-ever virtual sitting.Instead of a packed chamber for question time, peers took part remotely from their homes by internet link.The historic change led to less rowdy exchanges as members were called inidually by the Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, to speak rather than having to bob up and down in their seats in the House.Earlier in the Commons, Mr Rees-Mogg raised a smile among MPs when he joked: \"In , when the Black Death affected this country, Parliament couldnt sit and didnt the session was cancelled.ldquoThanks to modern technology, even I have moved on from  and Im glad to say that we can sit to carry out these fundamental constitutional s.

Its health service has been brought to its knees and the country remains under strict lockdown.So how can the Mafia thrive Rather than impinging their activities, lsquoLa Cosa Nostrarsquo - as the mob refers to itself - is defying lockdown and capitalising on the vulnerability of iniduals and businesses.In what ways Earlier this month, members held an elaborate funeral procession for a -year-old scion of one of Sicilys most renowned mob families, despite lockdown meaning funerals have been banned since early March. In the Sicilian district of Palermo, a local mob boss also organised a Good Friday church service, but it was ultimately halted by police.Making money Mafia clans are offering credit to firms on the brink, with anti-Mafia body, SOS Impresa, saying the virus has essentially transformed the mob into Italyrsquos largest bank, even buying shares in at-risk firms to offer apparent lsquolelinesrsquo that could soon be dead-weights.Targeting the vulnerable The Mafia provide necessities to poverty-stricken neighbourhoods - but these residents are then in the mobrsquos debt. Some debts are being repaid by those who find themselves newly unemployed agreeing to become foot-soldiers, boosting the Mafiarsquos numbers.Cleaning The mob has always invested in cleaning firms and delivery services and are now focusing on running funeral homes and hospital laundry services, two areas under severe pressure presently.Itrsquos always been this way On the island of Sicily, which was ruled by foreign invaders for centuries, islanders banded together to protect themselves and carry out their own brand of justice. In fact, the term rsquoMafioisorsquo - or lsquoMafia memberrsquo - originally had no criminal connotations, meaning only someone who was suspicious of authority.But by the mid-th century, the groups became private armies - lsquoMafiersquo - who extorted landowners and firms for protection money, evolving into the Sicilian Mafia as we know it today.The American mob A separate entity to the Sicilian Mafia, the US Mafia follows the same code of conduct, but is not faring so well. The cancellation of sporting events has wiped out millions of dollars in illegal gambling earnings, while other mafia mainstays, including extorting restaurants and construction rackets, have also ended, with eateries closed and building projects halted.Itrsquos just like the movies So many classic films feature the Mafia, from Francis Ford Coppolarsquos The Godfather, starring Marlon Brando, to Martin Scorsesersquos Goodfellas. But even Goodfellas was based in reality - inspired by the non-fiction book, Wiseguy, about mobster-turned-informant, Henry Hill.Tony Soprano The late James Gandolfini memorably played New Jersey mob boss Tony on iconic TV show, The Sopranos.

In the case of Covid-,one country is a pandemic hotspot, wersquore all at risk of reinfection.The ScotsmanScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard hoped the reconvening of the Scottish Parliament - obeying social distancing rules - would lsquousher in a new phase of heightened accountability and greater openness.rsquoHe said the national emergency was lsquoall the more reason for an intensication rather than a dilution of parliamentary scrutiny.rsquoldquoThat means members of the Scottish Parliament from all parties should have access to fully question Government ministers who are running the country during these most extraordinary of times, he said. ldquoEverywhere around there is mounting pressure to restart the economy. For me the choice is clear. Put simply, peoplersquos lives and well-being must be placed ahead of business considerations.He said those putting themselves most at risk during the pandemic - those working in care, for example, and stacking shelves supermarkets - are already those on lower wages, even zero hours contracts.ldquoSo the parliamentary scrutiny which we now need is about ensuring that the real-lived experiences of people have an influential bearing on the decisions made by both governments, he argued. ldquoIt is about ensuring that the maximum level of income support goes to those who need it. But it is also about the ethics of how we treat our elderly and infirm in the face of this pandemic. Everyone must have an equal right of access to treatment, dignity and respect and so the chance of le itself.The Stephen Pollard admitted there lsquowasnrsquot much to cheer about at the momentrsquo but, at a time when anyone over  is deemed especially vulnerable, he said, there was a lsquowonderful irony that the two people who have done most to bring us together are both in their s.rsquoldquoCaptain Tom Moore, the war veteran who captivated the nation over the weekend with his fund-raising walk for the NHS, is a scarcely believable , he said ldquoBut when it comes to the scarcely believable, nothing comes close to the fact that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is  today.Just over two weeks ago she spoke to the nation - and the world - about the pandemic.ldquoThere is no one  on the planet who could have talked as she did, with the history she has lived through and been part of, and with the respect she has earned from a le devoted to service and duty, he said. ldquoWe are so lucky to have her and all the more so at a time of national crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-now-vital-government-goes-way","story":"The UK did not start its present lockdown until March . Up until then, the UK Government had given out very mixed messages. It allowed international sports fixtures to go ahead, allowing , fans from virus-hit Madrid to come to watch Liverpool play on March . It allowed racingrsquos Cheltenham Festival to go ahead from March -. It stopped contact tracing on March  with no apparent strategy to replace it.Between March  and , the hospital death rates were doubling every two-to three days. On March , Boris Johnson gave a speech which advised people to socially distance and not go to pubs and restaurants. Schools remained open. Although a section of the community took this advice, public transport was still very crowded, people were still going out, and on the following weekend, we saw thousands of people flocking to beauty spots across the country. Obviously the message that Mr Johnson had given was not understood and did not have the intended effect and transmission was still occurring to a great extent.Finally, on March , the present lockdown was announced. If this had been done a week previously, as in Germany, Austria and other places, our death and infection rates would be up to a quarter of those at present. With a doubling rate of three days, simple mathematics shows that in a week, the infections will quadruple. If the present lockdown had been announced a week earlier, a lot of our present problems would not be as great. There would be less need for PPE, intensive care beds and mortuaries. The lockdown would not be required as long as the virus would not have infected as much of the community. The economy would perhaps be less affected.A few weeks ago Professor Jason Leitch was talking about achieving herd immunity in an interview on BBC Scotland. Todayit has been reported that the WHO estimates only two to three per cent of the population is infected. It has also been suggested that having had Covid- does not guarantee immunity. This should hopefully stop any suggestion that we should allow successive waves of infection until we build up herd immunity.The Scottish Government needs to organise testing in the community and contact tracing so that we can ease the lockdown and keep the virus under control. The suggestion that this could start off in the more easily-isolated areas of the country seems a good idea. The Scottish Government should not be waiting for a ided, leaderless UK Government Cabinet to make a decision.Rob Evans, Dundee DD.IT is vital that the Scottish Government follows the advice from Neil Mackay. Health issues are devolved to the Scottish Government andNicola Sturgeon is unable to draw up regulations appropriate for the conditions which pertain in Scotland then that does call into question how Scotland could operate as an independent country. The Scottish Government must show that it is capable of governing the country in a distinct and appropriate manner.The regulations in all four home countries appear to have been cut and pasted from the same source. As an initial response that was quite acceptable, especiallythe source document has originally come from the World Health Organisation or the regulations imposed in another European country. However, now that the regulations have been in force for a month the four home countries need to develop their own regulations. The lower population density in Scotland presents both opportunities and challenges. The easy option is to follow Boris Johnson and then claim a big boy did it and ran away.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackay has deemed Boris Johnsonrsquos approach to the coronavirus pandemic as a ldquodisaster and has urged Nicola Sturgeon to ldquobreak away. Ms Sturgeon has been at pains to stay more or less aligned to the Westminster approach, so far, which is to her credit, but deviation can only be sensiblethe course ahead is definite.All politicians will make mistakes over this new and uncharted coronavirus outbreak, it is inevitable, and sadly lives are always subject to such political judgments. At this stage no one can be sure about most of the answers but what is terribly obvious is that this whole episode has exposed the fragilities of Scottish independence. Just look at the oil price situation for example, hence Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire not to be out on a limb for fear of it breaking, and rightly so. It will not please some nationalists but we are definitely better together at this point in time and our First Minister seems to be aware of this fact.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IT is almost impossible to try to make sense of Neil Mackayrsquos article in a non-political perspective. First, no one can at this stage know what the result of the UK Government strategy will be. His criticism based on personalities is hardly factual. The main thrust of his argument that the Scottish Government should take a dferent approach is confusing, as there has been nothing to stop it doing so up to now presumably it believes the UKrsquos approach to be correct. Mr Mackay now needs to inform us in detail what detailed steps we should take in Scotland that are dferent.Colin McKay, Newton Stewart.THE UK Government has been on the receiving end of criticism from people and organisations across the political spectrum for its handling of some of the UK manestations of the Covid- pandemic.In particular, when the decision was announced in the last week or so in March, that the country would enter a period of lockdown which brought the economic le of the country to a juddering halt, there was comment that this action should have been taken seven,  or even more days earlier, and perhaps it should have. However, I wonderthe decision to postpone the onset of lockdown was made for very pragmatic reasons.Scroll back six or seven weeks or so, and we were being regaled on an almost daily basis in both print and broadcast media of y queues of people with trolleys waiting for supermarkets to open, and some time later, leaving these emporiums with trolleys stacked high with toilet rolls, kitchen paper, rice, pasta, part-baked bread rolls and other non-perishable goods, stripping the shelves bare in the process.Despite repeated pleas from civic, political and religious leaders, and the supermarket chains themselves, this activity continued for many days. I would imagine that, when introducing a new policy, particularly one which imposes considerable new restrictions, ministers and their advisors would consider what would be the likelihood of the target population co-operating with these new impositions, andimprobable, what scale of resources and expenditure would be required to compel and maintain their compliance.Given the response to the appeal for shoppers to revert to the pattern of purchasing that they had found perfectly adequate in the last week of January, the Government probably felt that it would have little chance of persuading the general population to accept much more drastic restrictions, at least until it had been persistently exposed to the carnage taking place in Italy and Spain. Even then, there were a signicant number of so-called Covidiots who seemed intent on defying any attempt to curb their liberty.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.THE language of war and battles to fight the coronavirus must stop.Language is a powerful tool. It can be used to both praise and demonise but either way it has an effect of on people, their wellbeing, their mental health. However, just as important as the adverse or positive effect that language can have on us as iniduals, words are also capable of shaping the public narrative to convince us what to think. Using war language to fight a health crisis is not helpful for at least three main reasons.The first is that it undermines legitimate challenge which, when it is absent, encourages systemic negligence to run rampantly unchecked.Secondly, it lulls us to uncritically accept the inevitability of thousands upon thousands of deaths, especially enabling the expendability of the costly, most vulnerable people in our society.Thirdly, war language demands sacrice and a culture of silence. This expectation is unnecessary, unwanted, and unhelpful it is anti-democratic and smacks of political expediency.All of these impacts are worrying and serves only as power and compliance tools for our political governors. Frontliners are workers, consistently undervalued ones, granted, but they are not warriors and they deserve the best protection. In light of this, more, many more questions need to be asked and answered.Why were we not prepared for this  Why are so many people dying compared to countries like Germany  Why are so many people dying in our care homes  Why are we demanding that our friends and family work on the frontline without full and proper protection for themselves and their patients  Why is there no urgency or recognition of the need to test and track Finally, in this modern Scotland, is it too much to ask to be treated like adults and receive honest answers in this bumbling, post-truth political world Councillor Brian McGinley , Ayr.I AM one of those people who go out every Thursday at pm to say thank you to all those dedicated people who are putting their lives and those of their families at risk to save others. I am, however, disappointed that the only references made regarding the Police Service are of issuing fines and heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the public in these dficult times.Their job is dficult enough and there is always a fine balance between discretion and enforcement.

The Good Morning Britain host was trashed for his criticism of Professor Jason Leitch, when the National Clinical Directorrefused to accept mass quarantining was the answer. ldquoListen to the expert! yelled Professor Leitch.Well, we did, and then we heard him say: ldquoWe have absolutely adequate levels of testing in Scotland. We heard his arguments for not testing: ldquoWersquore having to delay the spread of the virus. And, unbelievably, we heard him argue against social distancing: ldquoYou canrsquot keep m people six feet apart.We needed Morganrsquos questions at the time and we needed him again to kick hard at the shins of his Good Morning Britain colleague Dr Hilary after the telly doc backed the UK Governmentrsquos case for not yet closing the schools. Morgan raged again at the Government line, attacking Cabinet Minister Simon Clarke over \"shameful\" handling of PPE and him ldquonot having a clue how many health care staff had died. And during an interview with English culture secretary Oliver Dowden, Morganrsquos blood boiled at the insanity of allowing the Cheltenham Festival and the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid match to go ahead.But Morgan has shown added value this week on CNN, lambasting the morally bankrupt flibbertigibbet that is Boris Johnson and the asinine Donald Trump. . ldquoIrsquove been watching these daily briefings with mounting horror and, at almost every level, Donald Trump is failing the American people, with his self-aggrandising, self-justying rants.Morgan added: ldquoTo him, itrsquos more important he win the election in November. But it should be about focusing on saving human le. Trumprsquos following, thankfully, has dropped six points.Now, Morgan isnrsquot clairvoyant and he certainly doesnrsquot always get the argument right.This week he attacked Dr Andrew Lilico, after the economist had criticised the NHS, leaping onto easy argument like John Wayne on a small horse, off to kill some Injuns. But Dr Lilicorsquos argument about \"NHS worship\" was certainly not a criticism of those brave enough to work for this underfunded service.But what Piers Morgan at least managed was to open the debate.

I would urge Keir Starmer, the new leader of the Labour party in the UK, to process these complaints, to take decisive action, not just against Councillor Jim Dempster, but many others.He went on: ldquoIn terms of Richard Leonard,he thinks hersquos done enough and can now just pass over responsibility, and duck responsibility, then he should at the very least release all the correspondence that he sent to the UK Labour party on this issue demanding action is being action, so that we can actually judge the fact hersquos made an effort.ldquoI have to say Irsquove given up even speaking to Richard Leonard on this matter, or indeed raising it with the Scottish Labour party, because itrsquos clear to me that they donrsquot take these matters at all seriously.Earlier on the same show, Mr Leonard was asked about Mr Yousafrsquos previously saying he should be ashamed to show his face at anti-racism rallies given the Dempster case delay.Mr Leonard said: ldquoI am always happy to speak to Humza Yousaf about where we are with this case.

Look, for the le of me I donrsquot know why it has taken as long as it has.ldquoIt ought to have been dealt with more speedily, but the consideration of that case rests in the hands of the party at a UK level.Mr Leonard then tried to change the focus of the interview back to coronavirus.He said: ldquoI have to say, some of these issues are a source of frustration to me, but in the end we are dealing with a national crisis where people are dying, and the effect of this pandemic ought to be the thing which is first and foremost in our discussions and debates.ldquoItrsquos whatrsquos driving me, itrsquos what Irsquom spending all my waking hours dealing with, not with some of the internal grievance and disciplinary procedures of the Labour party.Mr Leonard was also asked about readmitting nine Labour councillors who were suspended from the party in May  for working with the Tories on Aberdeen City Council.Mr Leonardrsquos new deputy, Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie, and the Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray have both called for the lsquoAberdeen Ninersquo to be let back into the party.Asked why the matter had gone on for years and whether he was minded to readmit them, Mr Leonard again deferred to Labour in London: ldquoThe case of the Aberdeen councillors rests with the national constitutional committee of the Labour party.ldquoThere is a due process which needs to be followed and I am frustrated that it has taken as long as it has, but there is a due process which needs to be followed.ldquoTheir case is resting with the national constitutional committee of the Labour party.Askedthe committee was fit for purpose given the delay, Mr Leonard said: ldquoI am also frustrated it has taken as long as it has to get this resolved.ldquoWe understand that there is frustration faced by people in the Labour party in Aberdeen, members of that group in Aberdeen, but also this has wider implications too about how we go about our business as a party and itrsquos important that we give due process and donrsquot prejudice the hearings that will take place at some point in the future.In November, Mr Leonard admitted it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory the case had taken so long, but refused to get involved, saying it was a matter for Labourrsquos national constitutional committee.Askedhe ought to be involved, he said: ldquoNo, I donrsquot think I should be.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain. There can be no clearer case for their rights than the work they are doing right now.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body.

Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom. Peer support group times are still flexible while a schedule is created to meet demand. Mindfulness and yoga will run on Wednesdays at pm and Fridays at pm for the next four weeks.Anyone who is interested in joining either peer support or mindfulness and yoga should email scotland@diabetes.org.uk to be invited to a group and given instructions on how to access Zoom .Guidance regarding diabetes and coronavirus can be found at www.diabetes.org.uk coronavirus or by calling the Diabetes Scotland helpline on    or emailing helpline@diabetes.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In normal times, this is manageable – but these are unprecedented times.“Our staff are working incredibly hard and are still directly helping customers by phone, but the changes to our usual way of working mean that we cannot currently offer face-to-face support, or for people to simply drop by their local office.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago.

It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in .

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible.

The weekly classes by Helen McConnell, aimed at children aged between six and , teach skills on how to cope with missing friends, grandparents, boredom and being confined for long periods at home.Just six months after she launched her meditation classes at North Star Health and Wellbeing Centre in Eglinton and in some schools, Ms McConnell was forced to rethink how best to reach the children taking part.She contacted parents about online classes, which are now proving to be very popular.Normally classes last an hour but these online classes are just half-an-hour long, which we are finding are working well, Ms McConnell said.The classes are for children from primary two to around  or  and I try and tailor them to the issues they are going through right now because of the coronavirus.As the classes are done through Zoom, the parents can participate along with the children, because a relaxed mum is a relaxed child.Ms McConnell explained how they take a dferent theme each week.She added: This week for example we are dealing with sleep, which parents are telling me is a big issue for their children at this particular time.Children are away from their school friends, their home friends, their grandparents, and that is dficult for them, so I teach meditation on how to cope with that.This is a time of great uncertainty, so I teach children to meditate on what they can control and how to deal with what they can#t control.One of their favourites is the #magic carpet ride#, which helps children deal with boredom. Even though we are restricted in where we can go in our everyday le right now, in our imagination we are free to go wherever we like. While delivering her meditation classes online is an unusual way to teach children, Ms McConnell has been pleased at how well the youngsters are adapting.She added: Since I started this I haven#t had one single child who said they didn#t like it, even those who started the class because it was their parents who wanted them to do it. Children are really receptive to meditation, more so even than most adults would be.So it is wonderful to be able to help them cope with this very stressful time.More information can be found on the Facebook page Children#s Well-being with HelenBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was hospitalised with a TIA - a mini stroke - in February, shortly before Covid- arrived in the UK, but had recovered and was looking forward to a packed schedule of appearances.Earlier in the year I had a TIA, a mini stroke, in February, just two weeks before this all happened. Everything is good now - I got to hospital on time and got everything checked out. I#m only on more medication every day, so everything is good that way, he says.I would be fit enoughI had a heavy cold. I#ve no heart problems or respiratory problems and I was still playing golf up to last year. But the last thing I would want would be to contract Covid-.Total respect for everyone in the hospital, people in private care - anyone who is a carer or a nurse or a doctor.John says his schedule for the year ahead featured a lot of weddings, personal appearances, golf games and after-dinner speaking, but everything has gone to the wall: I#ve a few weddings in for July, but who knows whether they will happen.Normally I#m quite busy in spring with weddings, but I#m afraid to even look at it. Unless they reschedule for next year, it#s revenue you#re not going to get back.John was alerted to the looming crisis in early March when gatherings were restricted to less than  people, which put a couple of weddings at the start of this month at risk.Then it avalanched and everything was just put back. I can only hope and pray the Opera House will be up and running for Christmas because that is the next big thing - , to , seats have been sold already. I thinkthe auditorium was ready it would be a great thing, but I#m sure they#ll pull out all the stops and, please God, we go back to normality, he says.John describes le in lockdown as like Groundhog Day, with every day the same as the last: I say to Brenda, leave those dishes, I#ll do them tomorrow morning - it will give me something to do. Everything is washed, everything is clean. I#ve read three books in the last week but, oh my goodness, it#s like Groundhog Day.John says he#s looking forward to being able to go for a pint of Guinness with his mates after lockdown is lted and being able to hug his grandchildren.He laughs that he#s never been able to grow a beard before because of his work as May McFettridge, but now was the perfect opportunity. Viewers of a video he made for NI Hospice got to see it in all its glory, although he did shave it off this week.I#ve been growing a beard this last month or so. I had it down to a goatee -the panto isn#t working, I#ll get Santa somewhere, he says.I made another video for the carers in the private homes, just to give them a wee boost.‘I’ll never complain again about taking an early flight to a gig’William Caulfieldis in lockdown at his home in Donaghadee with his dachshund, Willow. He usually spends up to  weeks a year on cruise ships as a guest entertainer, but everything has been cancelled up until the end of August.He first heard about the coronavirus outbreak when he was working on cruise ships in Australia and New Zealand earlier this year.As I moved from ship to ship in early February, I was getting my temperature checked, but I felt very safe because everywhere you went there were hand sanitizers and your temperature was being checked, he says. Everything was grand, as we all thought at that time. Then the word came that the countries were closing their ports and I had to fly home a week earlier than I would have done. I was home a week before we went into lockdown.William was due to speak at a corporate dinner with the Young Farmers Clubs of Ulster on his arrival home, followed by a busy schedule of cruise ship appearances through spring and summer, as well as staging his Our Jimmy show at the Riverside Theatre at the end of May.At this stage, my next gig is supposed to be in New York City at the end of May too, but I can#t imagine New York being open, he says.I honestly can#t see anything happening prior to September. I have lost all those gigs but I#m not alone - we are all in the same situation.I will be down in earnings but at least I have my health andstaying at home means my friends and neighbours have their health, I don#t have a problem with it. While William was doing a Facebook Live session from his home, someone asked what his characters would be doing in lockdown and that gave him the idea of recording some videos.I shaved off my beard and got my costumes out of the storage unit and started to film some videos. I#ve done six pieces so far and, over the next two or three weeks, I#ll release maybe two a week, he says. They#re all to do with coronavirus and what the characters are doing during the lockdown.William explains he is looking forward to the early starts after lockdown is lted.I#m looking forward to the alarm going off at .am again when I have to go and get a flight. I will never complain again about going on that early flight, he says.But I#m looking forward to visiting my family and friends. Imagine meeting someone for a coffee - it#s going to be a fabulous thing.‘We’re building some garden furniture and decking out of pallets’Diona Dohertyis in lockdown in Craigavon with her husband, fellow comedian Sean Hegarty , her three stepsons, James , Charlieand Tomand two cats.She has been performing comedy for  years, including writing and performing shows and TV appearances in the likes of Derry Girls and Soft Border Patrol, before moving into stand-up a year-and-a-half ago.Diona says the family began restricting their movements around St Patrick#s Day and kept the boys off school afterwards.We decided to take our own action, largely because we#re self employed and every job we had booked up until the end of August was cancelled over the course of  hours. We lost a third of our annual income over three days, she says.We started locking down a week before the start of official lockdown and we were very, very strict about it.Diona says they had been commissioned to perform numerous stand-up gigs and she was due to play the lead in a BBC radio play, as well as embarking on a theatre tour with The Real Housewives of Norn Iron.They#ve all paused, because we don#t knowtheatres will open by autumn winter - it#s been a big hit, she says.During lockdown, she says, they#re been doing a lot of drinking and eating, a bit of homeschooling and going out for a walk every day, adding: We#re building furniture in the back garden out of pallets - we#ve built ourselves a decking area. We#re lucky that a few bits and pieces of work and writing have still stayed in place.I was writing a short movie for BBC iPlayer and I#m able to continue that, and we are writing two adult Christmas productions for the Opera House and the Waterfront. I think everybody is hoping the theatres will definitely be opened by then.Diona and Sean have recorded a few videos at home for social media, including a comedy holiday advert around the house that earned a lot of viewers.We did it really quickly round the house and it#s that message to stay in, she says.Sometimes you go a wee bit mad unless you have a creative outlet. You have to give yourself a bit of a creative outlet - even when it#s utter s****.After lockdown, she says, she#s looking forward to a McDonald#s and is also excited about getting back in a room with actors to rehearse a show.But I#m dreading doing stand-up ever again. You have to be doing it a couple of times a week for it to stick. You lose your rhythm. Unless you do it every day, you#ll not remember it, she says.‘When there’s no pubs open in the south on St Patrick’s Day, you know it’s serious’Paddy Raffis in lockdown in Belfast with his we Kimand two children Ronanand Clara . The former wedding band singer began doing stand-up two years ago in March , within a year selling out the Mac Theatre and the Limelight, followed by two sold-out nights at the Ulster Hall last summer.This spring, he was due to play two full-house gigs at the SSE Arena, one of which went ahead at the start of March and the other postponed to October.He says he realised how serious things were getting when they visited his mum#s caravan in Donegal shortly before St Patrick#s Day.It was a few days after that first SSE gig, which just about went ahead. It was the last mass gathering in Northern Ireland, which is a strange accolade to have. In fact, I took a picture of everybody behind me - it was an historic picture, Paddy says.We were self-isolating from about March  in Donegal - we pretty much stayed in the caravan. They were a bit ahead of us with guidance from the government - it was all gloves and masks. We cut our stay short and came home on St Patrick#s Day.When there are no pubs open in the south on St Patrick#s day and no-one#s drinking, you know it#s serious.Paddy had upcoming gigs in England and Scotland, but these have been postponed. However he normally does a lot of online comedy anyway.I#ve had more time to write online content. I#ve probably had my biggest surge in followers since I started, with a lot of videos getting two million views and followers in places like England, America and Australia, he says.Coronavirus is a very relatable topic, no matter where you are in the world, and the numbers are going through the roof - I#m getting a lot of interest from people who wouldn#t otherwise have seen my stuff.Because of the nature of things, I can#t go out to film much, but I#ve done a few videos when I was out on my walk. You realise how much your kids touch things when you#re out walking.I did one on a family Zoom quiz and that sketch went mega viral. I have a shed at the end of the garden where I#m doing a lot of work writing and filming, and I#m able to use that as space to do all that. My work hasn#t been impeded too much by it.Paddy says his in-laws are in the high risk category and his mum is self-isolating with his sister who is disabled, so he does the shopping for them and leaves it on their doorstep.After lockdown, he#s looking forward to getting back to gigging and is eyeing a third date at the SSE in October.I#ve had a good run over the last couple of years and this time in lockdown has given me more followers. A lot of people are asking where they can come and see me, he says.I#m looking forward to getting back out in front of people because I really miss the buzz of performing to a crowd.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said she realised there were people, such as those living in cities, who did need to travel a short distance to exercise.“I know there has been some ambiguity about that and the executive are looking at this matter again and will be giving more clarity in relation to all of that before the weekend,” she said.Askedministers would consider setting a distance limit similar to the km measure in the Irish Republic, she said: “I wouldn’t be in favour of putting a restriction like that on because there are many people who live in the city and they may have to travel a longer distance than that to be able to exercise.“So the mind of the executive is not moving in that direction but I do think we will be wanting to give more clarity in relation to this issue and we’re going to discuss it all again on Friday at the executive.”PAMost ReadMichelle O’Neill challenges Jim Allister to repeat ‘misled’ allegation outside AssemblyTributes to #big kingdom of Mourne character# DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson#s father Jim following passingManarrested as discovery of woman#s body south Belfast flat leaves community in state of shockVideo: Last footage of Alex Higgins shows cupboards stacked with food...but he couldn’t eat a biteSinn Fein man won#t be referring himself to watchdog over coarse email,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those workers are based in the Northern sector which takes in Derry, Strabane and Limavady. It comes after the Derry News revealed earlier this month that  workers were off across the Trust area because of COVID- - the illness that can affect your lungs and airways which is caused by coronavirus. Of those employees,  worked at Altnagelvin Hospital. There was a relatively even split between the numbers self-isolating due to symptoms of their own and those isolating because family members had symptoms. googletag.cmd.push Testing has been ramped up in dferent parts of NI, including Derry where a facility has just opened at City of Derry Rugby Club, to ensure that health and social care staff are kept safe. It is also hoped that testing will allow staff who are following government guidelines by isolating - but are not actually sick - toto work so they can assist during the first wave of coronavirus cases. However, according to the latest figures available  staff members are still absent. In a statement to the Derry News on Friday, a spokesperson for the Western Trust confirmed: “Whilst a number of staff have ed to work following a period of absence some staff have commenced new episodes of absence related to coronavirus. googletag.cmd.push “The total number of staff absent as at th April is . Since the introduction of testing on th March  and up to th April  a total of  Northern Sector staff have been tested – this covers both hospital and community staff.” Approximately , people responded to a workforce appeal by the Trust to allow it to cope with an increased demand on services in light of the coronavirus pandemic. That included retired doctors and student nurses who have joined the frontline. A quarter of those applicants have commenced work in a range of roles. A spokesperson explained. “The Trust recently launched a workforce appeal for staff and have appointed  staff to date. “The recruitment team is continuing to process a large number of applications.” Northern Ireland is nearing the end of what was described as the first wave of cases which was expected to peak between April -. Under this ‘reasonable worst case scenario’, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The latest Public Health Agencybulletin, as of April , reports  deaths. It is believed that this peak may be less severe than first anticipated but last Thursday saw the highest daily rise with  COVID related deaths in NI hospitals. That total was matched on Friday and a further  people tested positive, a development Health Minister Robin Swann described was a ‘wake up call’ as he warned against complacency. On Saturday a further  deaths were registered and one more person was added to the overall death toll on Sunday. TESTING Almost , people have been tested for COVID- in Northern Ireland - over , of them health care workers. The current target is set at over , tests per day with a view to scaling up over time and expanding priority groups. The test centre at City of Derry Rugby Club will assist with that upscaling. Criticism has been levelled at the government for limited testing in the community and contact tracing as that will be crucial when it comes to estimating population immunity and designing an exit strategy to move out of the current lockdown. Speaking last week Minister of Health Robin Swann said: “Testing of health care workers has been a key priority of mine and I am glad that in recent weeks we have tested over , of our frontline staff. “That’s important for them, and it’s also important for the people they support such as the residents in our care homes.” He continued: ”An expert working group has also been established to lead on the expansion of testing across all our laboratory services, both within Health and Social Care facilities, and also to consider options for the utilisation of other testing facilities including within the commercial sector. “There is a NI Testing Strategy that has already been shared with the Executive and the Health Committee. In that I have made it clear that the overall testing policy will be adjusted over time as testing capacity increases, and priority groups for testing are expanded. “Similarly the strategy also includes a pledge that testing will soon move towards surveillance of COVID- in the population to inform planning of services including surge capacity, and to estimate population immunity.“  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sectors include manufacturing which takes in food and drink, businesses making PPE garments, newspaper printers, manufacturers of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, computer electronic components, cyber products and ‘products critical to local, national global supply chains that are responding to the COVID- crisis.’ Other sectors are mining and quarrying, distribution, financial and insurance, agriculture, forestry and fishery and construction - when it relates to emergency services and emergency repairs to homes. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, service industries include transport, food delivery and takeaway, services providing food and drink to those imprisoned or homeless, print and broadcast media, postal service, veterinary activities, dentistry, funeral directors and laundrettes. A cinema, theatre or concert Hall can broadcast a performance to people outside the premises over the internet, or on radio or televisionEconomy Minister Diane Dodds published the guidance on making workplaces safer and the list of priority sectors which were drawn up by the Engagement Forum. The Forum was set up by the Minister to advise the Executive on the list of priority businesses sectors referred to in the Health Protection Regulations. It was also asked to advise on measures required to protect the safety of all workers. The forum is chaired by the Labour Relations Agencyand consists of representatives from business organisations, trade unions, local councils, government, the Health and Safety Executive NI, Public Health Agency and Food Standards Agency. It drew up a list of priority business sectors and developed guidance on safe working practices during the current COVID- crisis. The Minister presented these to the Executive on Monday, which agreed to publish both papers. SUPPLY CHAINS Speaking this week the Minister said: “It was very important that so many organisations from across our economy were represented and it is reassuring that they are united in their determination to work together towards a common goal. “The list is published for advisory purposes to allow companies to make their own decisions. If a company can work within the social distancing guidelines then it should do so. “The safety guidance will have practical application in the workplace. “Along with the accompanying guidance on safe working practices, the list is there to protect everyone in the workplace, to ensure our essential supply chains remain solid and to help Northern Ireland be ready to rebuild its economy when this crisis has passed.” She went on to say that the aim of the priority sectors list, which is fully supported by both business and union representatives on the Forum, is to clary what constitutes a priority sector at this time, and to support Northern Ireland companies to continue their business operations and protect the incomes of their workforces. The accompanying workplace safety guidance – ‘COVID-: Working Through This Together, A Practical Guide to Making Workplaces Safer’ – has been developed and informed by professional advice from the HSE, PHA and the LRA as well as input from an employer and trade union perspective.

Dorothy Hamilton lives in Cookstown and receives support from the Mid Ulster Age Sector network set up by Age NI, who have an office in Magherafelt. “I feel like a prisoner in my own house, to tell you the truth,” said the -year-old. “I used to take the car to Tesco, and I looked forward to going to get groceries and all, but that’s out of the question now. It’s like being in the army, I believe, in Tesco now, it’s hard work. googletag.cmd.push The loneliness of the lockdown was brought into sharp focus for Dorothy last week when she celebrated her thbirthday at home. She said: “I had my birthday on Monday, and I was here on my own. I suppose people wanted to come round but they couldn’t come in. “It’s awful having to spend your birthday on your own with no visitors at all. It’s been three weeks or a month since I’ve been out, I’m fed up on my own in the house. “It’s a quiet place to live, but I didn’t realise it could be as quiet as it is now. All my friends have moved out to where. It’s dficult at times.” googletag.cmd.push When the lockdown was first announced, Dorothy did her best to make the most of the free time, but as time went on, it became more dficult. She said: “It’s been three weeks or a month since I’ve been out, I’m fed up on my own in the house. I try to keep dressed reasonably well asI’m going out somewhere. “I was grand at the start for ten days or so. I sat one day sewing and was quite content and it passed the afternoon for me, but you can only pass the time for so long and the rest of the time you don’t know what to do with yourself.” “With things the way they are, I must start and exercise, but I’m very sore. I sat one day sewing and was quite content and it passed the afternoon for me.” The former health service worker says the support she is getting from Mid Ulster Age Sector network, and in particular Linda and Raymond McGarvey, has been a real help. Dorothy says Linda is very strict, but she understands the need for the stringent measures and is aware of the danger the virus can pose. “Linda comes down and she’s really strict – she has gloves and the lot,” she said. “I’m looking forward to this ban being lted but old people are dying in the homes like flies. The economy is terrible. I would hate to have a small business because I’d have to close. “I miss getting out in the car most of all. I don’t drive all that far but I miss getting out down the road. That’s all gone. “I also used to walk for miles butyou went out on your own here now, they’d think you weren’t wise!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes after the results of the NUS Coronavirus and Students Survey , which involved almost , students across all regions, age ranges and learning experiences in the UK. Covid- has left students fearful for their futures, with % indicating concern over the virus impact on the wider economy, while % expressed concern about future job prospects. % of working students said they may require extra financial support as that income drops, but just % indicated they were at critical risk of being unable to access their education. googletag.cmd.push Almost three-quarters were worried about the risk to their final qualications, while % were worried about the impact of the pandemic on their employability. In response to the surveys findings, the NUS has called on the government to provide a pound million national hardship fund and an economic package for those who complete their qualications during the pandemic. The union has also pressed for the option for every student to redo the year at no further cost, while receiving full maintenance support, or for a reimbursement for the academic year. NUS National President,Zamzam Ibrahim, said the need for a safety net was urgent. googletag.cmd.push Coronavirus has hit thousands of students in the pocket and severely affected the quality of their learning, he said. The majority are paying extortionate fees for their education and are treated as consumers but are left out in the cold when the product cannot be delivered as described. Face-to-face teaching and assessments have had to be hurriedly moved online, and placement and other practical activity has had to be cancelled. Students have lacked access to key resources, such as libraries and spaces, disabled students have been left unsupported, and students and staff have been struggling with other demands on their finances, welfare and wider lives as lockdown restrictions are enforced. Students are being forgotten during the Covid- pandemic. We are the future workforce that will have to help to rebuild our economy over the coming years. The NUS is a confederation of over  student unions across the UK and works with more than % of all higher and further education students.

We are now entering the th day of lockdown with strict regulations in place to curb the spread of Covid-. The current situation is set to last until at least May  and as many seek comfort from the virus’ threat, they are turning their attention towards happier days. Re-runs of old TV programmes are filling the airwaves. The GAA has made  All-Ireland finals available to watch online. News archives are being pored over for hidden gems. Nostalgia is king at the moment, but Maghera psychologist Sarah Connell is not surprised by the phenomenon. googletag.cmd.push “It’s a really comforting emotion,” says the owner of Minding Me Psychologists. “It brings back times when we’ve been accepted and loved, and it provides some badly needed relief in these times of uncertainty. “People are generally frightened by change, because we don’t always feel like we’re in control of things. Having that sense of being in control is really important for our well-being. “We can retreat to the past and think of when times were good, and we felt like we were in more control of things. I think that really helps us to be more stabilised and feel better about things. googletag.cmd.push “I think sometimes we can use it as a wee bit of an escape as well. It can take us out of the situation we are in that, for some people, is really challenging.” Although nostalgia is widely regarded as a positive emotion, this was not always the case and early research into the area deemed it to be a psychological problem. The term was coined by Swiss doctor Johannes Hoffer in , who deemed it a ‘neurological disease of essentially demonic cause’ after studying Swiss mercenaries stationed abroad. It arose from the Greek terms nostos – meaning a yearning tohome – and algos – its associated pain. Hoffer also concluded that the condition may have been caused by incessant cowbells in the Alps causing damage to the soldiers’ ears and brain cells. Even throughout the th and th centuries, it carried the stigma of ‘immigrant psychosis’, a form of ‘melancholia’ and a ‘mentally regressive compulsive disorder’. Sarah describes the concept as ‘bittersweet’ and refers to it as a ‘double-edged sword’. “Because it triggered dissatisfaction and lots of negative emotions like stress, fear and loss, it was interpreted as something you don’t want to have,” she says. “It really is bittersweet. It’s sweet because we’re remembering the good times, all the things that were good in the past, but it’s bitter because we know we can never regain that experience. “It’s gone forever. Time is irreversible and there’s something really sad about that. “The song ‘Days of Our Lives’ by Queen has the lines: ‘Can’t turn back the clock, can’t turn back time, ain’t that a shame’ and I think that really summarises it well. “Although it’s a lovely thing to think back, we can’t turn back the time. It’s really positive in one way but there’s a downside to it as well.” Nostalgia is often triggered by activities that people enjoy, such as music or sport, and Sarah says this is especially the case during a time of psychological distancing. “It can really help counteract feelings of loneliness,” she said. “It’s a huge link because those [music and sport] are things we love. If we think back to times when you played a good match, or went to an enjoyable concert, those are happy memories. “Nostalgic thoughts unite us with people again in our minds. It increases the perception of social support and reminds us of a time when we were with people, doing things and enjoying them.” A rise in nostalgia can often be a result of coming face-to-face with your own mortality and as the death toll in Northern Ireland reaches , people are increasingly worried. “It’s giving them that sense that you actually can die,” says Sarah. “Some people are quite concerned about it, but others probably still feel an element of ‘that’s not going to happen to me’. “One thing many are most concerned about is the economic effect that it’s having. They’re concerned about job loss – a lot of people have been furloughed. “They’ll be wonderingtheir job will continue after this period and what will happen in terms of paying bills and mortgages. The fear that we are going to go into recession is causing worries. Through talking to clients, Sarah has heard many people talk about the unexpected positive aspects that have arisen from the effects of the lockdown. She says: “I am hearing a lot of people really focusing on the positives, which is great. They are loving having more precious time to spend with their families and their children. “Little things like the slower pace of le – you can hear the birds singing more in the mornings. It’s giving time for people to reflect and re-evaluate their lives. Although the psychological distancing that we are currently having to enforce increases feelings of isolation and loneliness, people are adapting. Sarah says: “People are finding ways of coping with it by trying to find a bit of regularity in their lives - doing things like exercise every day and keeping some kind of structure to their day. “We’ve gone from being able to do whatever we want to having massive restrictions on us. “None of us like being told what to do or being held back from living our lives how we want to live them. “We’re having to draw on our willpower to focus and do the things that are right for ourselves and for everyone.” If nostalgia can act as a buffer against the fear and frustration caused by Covid-, then open that GAA archive, put on the old TV re-runs and wallow in reminiscent therapy.

Judes story is all the more remarkable given that his book Why Does Daddy Always Look So Sad was first self published just last May.By October his searingly honest account of being autistic and being a father had been snapped up by Beyond Words the same American company that published worldwide best selling self help book The Secret.Judesays he wrote thebookfor his son Ethan, now , to show autstic peoples livescan be every bit as happy and fulfilled as those not on the spectrum. The title of the book came from a question Ethan, who is not autistic, askedJudesmum when he was just three.Judestarted writing the book to record his childhood and journey into fatherhood, after realising that most of the books on autism focused on children, not parents. googletag.cmd.push It was a bit of a bucket list thing, to have a book published before I was , he says.  I wanted to make a record of my early le and Ethans early le.Im proudly autistic now but that wasnt always the case.I used to try and hide it.After sending it off to a string of literary agents with no successJudepublished it himself and it went on to earn a stringof five star reviews on Amazon and attractedthe attention of one of the worlds leading consultants on autism, Maisie Soetantyo.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  also caught the eye of an American literary agent who took it to Beyond Words Publishing.Impressed byJudes warts and all story which detailed his childhood struggles, through to adaptingto becoming a parent they agreed to launch the book in the US with a speaking tour.Beyond Words Publishing get submissions from all over the world but they only publish about  books a year so for them to publish my book is just unbelievable, saysJude. googletag.cmd.push I never in my widest dreams thought this was going to happen.The publishers said the book resonates with people because its not about swimming the channel or climbing Everest, Im just a normal, relatable person.Im remarkably unremarkable but they thought it was important to get my story out there.For the past eight monthsJudehas been working closely with his publisher to plan the promotion of his book.They are eight hours behind me, so I wouldbe finishing work atpm and they would just be starting, he explains.But with the outbreak of the coronavirus all the carefully laid plans have had to be scrapped.Its in the lap of the gods, but I just dont want it to vanish without a trace, says Jude.I want to out it in frontof as many people as possible. Growing up dferentJude, who grew up in the Bogside before moving to the Waterside, says he knew from a young age that he was dferent.I have never felt not dferent, he says.ObviouslyI have always been autistic, and I always would have been aware too that other children would be out playing games or playing in the street and I spent most of my time alone.Juderecalls spending hours lining up his toy cars on the window sill of his childhood home in Gartan Square.By a stroke of luck the flat recently came up for sale and Locate Estate Agents agreed to let him come and have a look around.That was magic, saysJude.The atmosphere was still the same.I could just imagine my mammy and my daddy there and my wee sister Emily tottering aboutI rang up Locate because Im a chancer and said Ive written this book and its out all over the world and a lot of happened there.Growing up Jude went to the Model School Derry, Oakgrove and St Columbs College.I had a lot of help and support and at the time I was resentful of it, but I look back more fondlyat it now, he saysThere were no autism support groups in the city at that time, so when Jude was a teenager he joined cross community youth group Reach Across.His lazer focus and love of order were put to good use helping to organise activities and grant applications and at  he was invited back to the group as a leader.This led him on to a Social Work degree at Ulster University, Magee.The boy who has social dficulty ended up being a social worker, he smiles. Becoming a dadJudesaid he used to perceive autism as something that he had grown out of.He had a successful job as a social worker and was able to navigate le well. But becomingadad at the age of  threw his carefullyordered world into disarray.Instead of cherishing and celebrating this wee baby I was more preoccupied with wheres my sense of control , he admits.When Ethan was three he asked his granny the heart wrenching question why does daddy always look so sad , which was to become the title of the book.He was able to pick up that I wasnt happy or that I found things dficult, Jude explains.And he still knows when Im not happy.Hes  now and he knows that I like things done a certain way.I have a lot of buttons and he has lots of wee fingers to press them with, he laughs.So was Ethans question the catalyst that turned Jude into the perfect father No, that would be far too easy, he sighs.It wasnt a lightbulb moment.Embracing being autistic and fatherhood was a gradual process that has continued after the publication of the book.I had to give in and accept I was autistic.I would have said i have autism but I have become more educated and listened to autism voices and they would say they are autstic, not that they have autism.Its not a handbag or an accessory that you have.Its an intrinsic piece of someone.I used to think in my own head I have a condition, but its the way I am.Its not something fatal or that needs treatment.Judes view of autism has come full circle and he now regards it as a blessing.To me its an advantage and to a lot of autistic people its an advantage.Autistic people are the most passionate and driven iniduals.If it wasnt for autstic people there would be no fire, no wheel, no electricity, no music, no arts, nothing!   Reaching outSince publishing the book last yearJudehas given a series of talks and book signings which have given the -year-old social worker the chance to reach out to autistic children.I love meeting autistic kids.They are like me and I am like them.Im not in the business of giving parenting advice and when I give a talk to parents its always the kids who ask the questions.Theres a misconception that autistic kids dont know they are dferent.I want to tell them that things will be grand.He has also been contacted by people from around the world who have been touched by his story and he has encouraged anyone with questions to get in touch with him online.I reach out to people all the time and I have a black belt in responding, saysJude.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  is available on Amazon in both paperback and ebook.For more information seewww.judemorrowor theJudeMorrowAuthor page on Facebook.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

The cast, led by the remarkable Teresa O’Kane, produced their own version of the Black and White Minstrels Show, whose national production would later cause widespread controversy. Teresa’s son Joseph O’Kane was involved in the show and admits that the production would certainly not have happened in the current era. “It wouldn’t be too politically correct now,” he told the County Derry Post. “She had to get black and white dye out of some theatrical place in Belfast. Everybody was blackened up with white eyes. You couldn’t get the stuff off you for about two days afterwards!” googletag.cmd.push The show began le as a light entertainment show and ran for around  years on BBC prime time television, where it was hugely popular. A spin-off stage show also played for a decade at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, before going on tour to Australia and New Zealand. It courted controversy, however, when it was accused of racism and ethnic stereotyping by anti-racist groups in the UK due its use of the theatrical make-up known as ‘blackface’. From the boardwalks of London, the local production in rural south Derry proved a hit from the moment it debuted at St Patrick’s Hall in Castledawson on October , . googletag.cmd.push  The hall itself was built in  after local businessman Patrick Convery donated land on New Row and was used by both parish and club until it was rebuilt as St Patrick’s Church in . “They went round all the local clubs – Glen, Slaughtneil, Swatragh, Kilrea, Bellaghy and Lavey and the rest,” recalls Joseph. “It was really good. They had a chorus of these black and white minstrels and girls and then they had a few solo artists and other groups.” Joseph remembers Frank Toner standing out as the star, closing the show with a stirring rendition of a well-known classic. “Frank was a cousin of my mother’s, a big, stout man, I remember him well,” he said. “He sang ‘Mammy’ by Al Johnson and was really good at it. He looked the part, but he was a referee as well. “I remember him refereeing one day in Claudy and there was a wee bit of a skirmish. I was playing at the time and he come up to me and says “Right Joe, what’s your name ” One set-piece from the show has caused Joseph no end of amusement throughout the years that followed. “There was a thing called the Tiny Tots,” he said. “My mother found all these cubs of three or four years of age. She had gathered up a kit for every county in Ireland. I don’t know how she did it, there were no O’Neill’s shops back then. “I don’t know whether she got someone to make all those jerseys, because I don’t think they did children’s jerseys back then in . “So as the wee lads came out dressed in whatever county it was, the chorus would have sung a verse of a song that would relate to that county. “I get grown men coming up to me when I’m out and telling me: “I remember being in the Tiny Tots – I was Wexford”. The Black and White Minstrel show was cancelled by the BBC in , but its  adaptation on the banks of the Moyola still brings fond memories to all who witnessed it.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Schools officially closed because of the coronavirus pandemic on March . At the time, key workers were told that schools would remain open to provide supervised learning only for children who ‘absolutely need to attend’. Some parents have had dficulty finding places for their children including senior health care workers in the city. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Figures collected for Wednesday  April for Derry City and Strabane District Council showed that  schools responded to a daily survey as being open, with  children reported as attending open schools. Fty two schools responded as being closed. googletag.cmd.push “It should be noted that figures can fluctuate on a daily basis. Figures collected for the same day the previous week show that there were  children reported as being in open schools. “An interactive map displaying schools open for supervised learning can be accessed on the Education Authority website. This is updated daily.” According to today’s map, April , there are  schools open in Derry and the surrounding area but only three with pupils in attendance - Lisnagelvin P.S., Eglinton P.S. and Broadbridge P.S. Many people were unhappy with delays to school closures in the North. However, based on scientic advice on how to limit spread of the COVID- virus the decision was taken that children who can stay safely at home, should, to limit the chance of the virus spreading. googletag.cmd.push This is dferent in other countries and jurisdictions but is based on sound scientic advice, so that critical services can be maintained and the spread of the virus reduced. Parents and carers were advised to send their child to schoolthere is ‘no other viable option’. For many there is no other option at present, as childcare services have closed and people have been advised against leaving children with grandparents as they are amongst the high risk category. Supervised learning is about providing a facility in schools and pre-schools for vulnerable children and those of key and critical workers to allow parents to continue with their vital jobs.

It was half-buried but I saw the top of it. “It doesn’t look like a medicine bottle – it’s clear. I knew it was old glass because you could still see the bubbles in it, and it wasn’t symmetrical. googletag.cmd.push “I knew it was a good age, but I didn’t know what it was for, whether it was for whiskey or medicine or anything.” Dean then took to the internet to seehe could unearth any details about the mysterious ‘Joseph McManmoy’, but his search drew a blank. “The first thing I did was Google it, but there was absolutely nothing and no name the same. It’s not a usual name. “The name has thrown everybody that I have asked because it’s so unusual.” The search for any trace of the name is still ongoing, but Dean has ensured the bottle has found a safe home. googletag.cmd.push He said: “An aunty of mine is big into traditional, vintage, oddly shaped stuff. “She would have wee medicine bottles and stuff around the house, so I took it home to her. She loved it, she was like an excited child.” While his efforts to find Mr McManmoy have not yet proved fruitful, Dean has his own theory about how the bottle came to rest on the Loughshore. “I would say it has come down the Moyola and washed out in the floods over the wintertime. God knows how long it was lying somewhere .”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deal was first agreed in principle with the five major teaching unions last June, but has now been formally presented to members for approval. Siobhan McElhinney, a member of the union’s Northern Committee, said it has the potential to change the lives of teachers across all sectors. “One of the main selling points is the opportunity of getting the backpay,” she told the County Derry Post. “Members will be backpaid from September  and that is a major selling point. The ask was % and the unions have negotiated .%. That’s not bad in the world of negotiation. googletag.cmd.push “The other big strength is the workload. Beforehand, people negatively on social media were saying these things have been talked about. “They were, but they were never agreed with management and DE . Everybody has now totally supported this workload agreement. “This deal will change people’s lives. It will make a definite improvement to work-le balance for everybody.” The Covid- outbreak has forced the union to use an online poll for what would ordinarily be decided by postal ballot and members have voiced opposition over the timing of the deal. Voting in the poll is currently underway and will continue until Wednesday evening at .pm. googletag.cmd.push Social media posts from INTO encouraging members to approve the deal have prompted criticism, with some members also feeling it doesn’t go far enough to meet their demands. “This deal has been agreed in principle since last June,” said Siobhan. “Other public sector workers had issues and then you had the nurses who really deserved to get theirs sorted out and then we were coming along next. It was always going to be now. “In the south Derry area, we have -odd members and a lot of very, very positive reps in schools. There is a positive vibe, people see it as it is. “There are nine dferent workstreams and six of them are to be acted upon immediately. The Minister and the deal is allowing people to get their house in order and then we look again.” The Maghera native feels the deal provides an opportunity for a realignment in what is expected of teachers within their roles. She said: “The word ‘inspector’ terries people, but ETIhave produced a ‘myth-busting’ document to outline what they are looking for from a school. “Sometimes teachers go beyond what they’re supposed to do, and this [deal] actually asks them to keep in mind from now what they are supposed to be doing. “It’s like a Gaelic player on the football pitch. They play their time and when the whistle is blown, they stop. They don’t go into extra time unless they are asked to. “Teachers keep going beyond what they are supposed to be doing and that’s what causes exhaustion, leaves them shattered within their job and negative towards everything .” Siobhan says approval of the deal would not be the end of the process, but a new beginning and that the union would be working to ensure its benefits impact on their members. She said: “A lot of people are quietly delighted. For a teacher at the top of the main scale, net back pay is going to be in the region of pound,. “There are so many positives in the recognition of trade union movements, consultation on workload. We intend to help members implement it to improve their work-le balance. “If you have happy teachers, you have happy pupils and happy pupils make happy families.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

It is the latest jinx in a long series of mishaps which have bedevilled the garage proprietor.The Rice family moved to Drumaness in what seemed the final chapter in a long running wrangle over a smoke problem at their home in Carlisle Park, Ballynahinch.The fire destroyed almost everything and it was in response to the ldquoraw deal which Mr Rice was getting that the Drumaness committee was formed.The Drumaness Community Action Committee is only eight-strong, but a spokesman pointed out that they had the backing of the whole community.A collection was taken around the Drumaness district last week and raised more than pound for Mr Rice. Since then donations have been pouring in and already another pound has been collected.The spokesman added: ldquoWe think he [Mr Rice] is getting a raw deal and we are determined to do something about it.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Work is well underway on a pound, environmental improvement scheme for Ballynahinch Square.The scheme, which will give the much-maligned square a major facelt, has been brought about after much pressure from the local chamber of commerce.The chamber has been pushing for the resurfacing of the square for over a decade, but the breakthrough didnrsquot occur until late last year when negotiations between the owners, the Ker Estate, and the Department of the Environment were finally completed.The scheme will entail the resurfacing of the square, the planting of shrubs, the building of a lsquositting wallrsquo and the re-use of flower boxes.

They noted with regret that the council was again unable to give them any support.The committee agreed there was great interest in the town on their ambitious plans, particularly the initiative to build a replica of the Ferguson monoplane, and it was agreed that an appeal for funds to local businesses, hotels and guest houses would have to be made in the near future.Mr Fergusonrsquos daughter will be coming to Newcastle on July and it is hoped she will attend the Miss Newcastle ball, which will be held in the Slieve Donard Hotel that night, and the festival parade the following day.DOWNPATRICK mdash A call has been made this week for the public to help stamp out vandalism in the Downpatrick area.It comes from Downpatrick councillor, Mr Cecil Maxwell, who felt he had to speak out after three incidents at Downpatrick Cathedral last week when excrement was littered around the building.ldquoIt is sad that a holy place is vandalised, especially in Holy Week, he said. ldquoThe time has come for the general public to stop this sheer vandalism.Appealing for more co-operation from the public with the police, Mr Maxwell pointed out that other churches and schools in the area had also suffered severely at the hands of vandals.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar Choral Societyrsquos ninth annual concert, Sing A Rainbow, will be presented next Tuesday and Wednesday in the War Memorial Hall, Crossgar.Such is the standard of this musical event that the society plays to full houses every year and there is no doubt that this yearrsquos production will be correspondingly attended.

I liked the balance of having the occasional day at home and the rest of the week in the office.ldquoI think the boys are definitely happy at having mummy home all the time and we all are enjoying that but they miss their school friends.

He also rode many to finish either second or third during the season.The original fixture list for  is now null and void so the original dates for Downpatrick and Down Royal, when we hopefully get back to normal sooner than later, will be all change to those originally sent out to members.An interesting fact that I learned with interest at the weekend was that Willie Robinson, who rode Laffy to win the  Ulster National at Downpatrick for the Queen Mother, was retained by Major John Corbett of Tyrella to ride for him.This was in the s before he moved to England as stable jockey to Fulke Walwyn. O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

Clearly the vast majority of people heeded the advice they had been given, but there were a number of issues involving young people drinking together, the councillor continued.ldquoThe lsquostay at home messagersquo has got through but there is no room for complacency. We need to keep this up and while I appreciate that it is dficult and frustrating for many to stay at home and only venture outside for essential supplies, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.Cllr Clarke said while everyonersquos focus was on doing everything they could to stay safe, he believed that the pandemic will pass.ldquoWe all have a role to play to ensure that this happens as soon as possible, he said. ldquoPeople are yearning for ato normality, but we all need to play out part to ensure that this happens.Cllr Clarke said the impact of the lockdown was having a major impact on businesses in Newcastle who rely heavily upon tourism and who are suffering as a result of the current restrictions on businesses opening.ldquoBusiness has been devastated and I hope that those who have been forced to close will be provided with all the help and support they deserve moving forward, he continued.Cllr Clarke also praised all frontline NHS workers and Newry, Mourne and Down Council staff for continuing to deliver services in the face of the pandemic.He added: ldquoWe owe these people so much. They have stepped forward to help in their own respective fields and deserve our thanks.ldquoAll NHS staff have been fantastic as have local authority directors, who are working from home, and a number of other frontline staff.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later. The school at that time only had  children mdash it now has  children registered with double classes in all year groups and the nursery.ldquoI was appointed acting principal and Irsquove been acting principal ever since, quips Mr Moore.ldquoThe highlights for me have been many. Itrsquos been a honour not only to see children develop and flourish, but also my staff. Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors. I have been truly blessed to have a staff who have had a collective desire to put children first.Mr Moore also paid tribute to the parents and s for their ldquodaily partnership with the staff and your personal support to me as principal for over two decades.He and his we, Lynne, who live in Saintfield, share five children together and he says retirement will bring him a chance for them both to travel ndash when the travel ban is lted ndash and for him to devote more time to his beloved sports mdash hersquos a major football and rugby fan.He has been approached to do some educational consultancy work when he is officially retired but is happy to limit that to just several days a week.Mr Moore added: ldquoI can honestly say that during my time at Academy I have never wished that I had been a school leader anywhere  or that I was employed in an alternative profession.ldquoI will definitely shed a tear or two when I go. They will get over me, of course, as nobody is irreplaceable, but I will certainly miss the children and staff. I will not miss the responsibility of the day to day running of the place, but Irsquom a social animal and I will really miss everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Legacy.jpg","title":"The legacy of John de Courcy  ","story":"THE story starts in  when the Norman soldier-adventurer, Sir John de Courcy, went north from Dublin, the headquarters of Norman power in Ireland, and arrived at Downpatrick on February .De Courcy was a man of great physical strength and size. He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said that as well as covering the local courts and the council, the paper “gives you the local news that wouldn’t be deemed important enough for a regional newspaper, it does community notes from every community it serves, it helps celebrate and mark local milestones, it acknowledges good work locally, it has all the local sport, it has local photography and so as well as news it is integral to a lot of social s in the community”.Noting the absence of either an upper chamber or an official opposition at Stormont, he added: “To lose one of the three regional papers would be unthinkable, particularly atthis time when it is almost on its own as a body of scrutiny of the Executive.”When asked about other industries which are also struggling, Mr Nesbitt said: “I understand the argument that everybody is in crisis and needs help.”However, the MLA said that Northern Ireland was particularly reliant on the media for scrutiny of politicians and others, given the weaknesses of scrutiny within our legislature.Mr Nesbitt said that elements which in most democratic societies would hold the government to account such as an upper chamber and an official opposition are absent in Northern Ireland, meaning that “themedia in Northern Ireland is more signicant politically than in any other region or country in these islands”.He said that the Executive had taken “unimaginable powers to interferewith every citizen’s liberty, freedom of movement, freedom of association, and at the same time the Assembly has given up an incredible degree of its powers of scrutiny, for understandable reasons.“The media should be stepping into that gap so I believe there is a special case on those grounds.”—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

We are screening patients with a phone call before attending their homes and staff will wear the appropriate PPE equipment during every household visit. However, we can only do this when we have the right PPE equipment available and are grateful to have recently received support from our colleagues at the Cardf and the Vale University Health Board to gain access to some PPE through their supply, for which we give our thanks.ldquoHowever we are always in need of more supplies to continue to provide vital end of le care to people living with a terminal illness, especially at this dficult time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The region had recorded  deaths in the pandemic by Wednesday. vw,vw,px, px\"Social distancing restrictions are in place in Northern Ireland for at least another two weeks The First Minister was asked whether the contrasting experiences meant Northern Ireland may move away from the restrictions at a dferent pace from worse hit parts of the UK.ldquoIt will be led by the criteria that will be set down and agreed by ourselves in the Northern Ireland Executive in conjunction with the our colleagues in the other parts of the UK, she told Cool FM.ldquoAnd because of that you could well see dferent parts of the United Kingdom move in dferent time to other parts, because it will be criteria-led.ldquoWhat do I mean by that ndash we will have to look at the amount of admissions to hospital, the admissions to intensive care units, the number of deaths we have, what it means for us in terms of the science.ldquoWe have a scientic advisory group in London that advises and then we also have our own advisory group here in Northern Ireland and our own chief medical officer.ldquoSo they will be looking at all of that information, all of the data we collect in Northern Ireland, we will bring that together and then wersquoll look at it that way.Earlier on Wednesday, Health Minister Robin Swann said the decisions around restrictions would be primarily based on what the scientic evidence base was in Northern Ireland.At the daily Covid- briefing he was asked whether the region should be part of an all-island exit strategy with the Irish Republic, given the shared land border.ldquoItrsquos important that we take our scientic guidance based on the science that is applicable to Northern Ireland, he said.Chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said he and officials were in close contact with colleagues south of the border.ldquoThere is no doubt that we share a common land mass with our close colleagues and neighbours in the Republic of Ireland and that is something that we will closely need to consider, he said.ldquoAnd I think the other thing which I would point out is that the virus on this island in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is behaving very similarly and dferent to other parts of the United Kingdom.In the interview, Mrs Foster also said the executive intended to offer more clarity on how far people can travel from home to take part in exercise.Police have been accused to going beyond the rules set by emergency legislation by telling people that they cannot drive to a location away from their home for exercise.Officers have insisted they are working in line with legal advice and do use discretion when appropriate.Mrs Foster said the executive would discuss the issue on Friday.
