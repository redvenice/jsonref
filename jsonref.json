The ready meals are pictured above ready to be shipped to various places across the country          Ready set fire! Sophie said she rarely pulls the trigger herself and described herself as an \u0027awful shot\u0027The meals are perfect for people looking for more local and sustainable food sources - and to cut the air miles out of their eating.\u0027I\u0027m very much a country girl, born and bred, and have always been frustrated at the bad press pheasant gets,\u0027 Sophie said.\u0027Everyone\u0027s default is chicken, but pheasant is much better for you. It\u0027s had a better life, it\u0027s free range and sustainable.\u0027It\u0027s definitely far better than a chicken which has been cooped up in a cage all its life.\u0027Quintessentially British, pheasants have been shot across the nation for several centuries, but in recent years have rarely been eaten outside countryside communities.              Preparing the bird: Sophie is pictured left cutting the bird and right plucking the feathers to prepare it         Proud as punch. Sophie said she sometimes serves friends and family pheasant and they have no ideaThe rich, gamey flavour sometimes puts off diners, but Sophie is a passionate advocate for the taste and health benefits of the birds.She has overcome this by adding the meat to family favourites and allowing customers to get used to the flavoursome game.Sophie came up with the idea for ready meals in January 2018, when playing a trick on her husband Matthew.He had always insisted he didn\u0027t like pheasant, much to his wife\u0027s frustration.              Out in the wild! Sophie is pictured above carrying her birds through the fields after a shoot          Country girl at heart! Sophie said her upbringing in the Highlands had helped her with her new business Sophie had grown up in the glens of Scotland, where pheasant and other game were regular dinner-time meals.\u0027We used to have a freezer full of pheasants all throughout the year, which had been shot by my father and grandfather,\u0027 she said.\u0027It was one of the most common meats we ate growing up, there was always a plentiful supply through the season.\u0027But despite her hunting heritage, she could not persuade her husband to try it.\u0027I thought if he doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s pheasant, what he doesn\u0027t know won\u0027t hurt him,\u0027 Sophie explained, laughing.\u0027I made him a pheasant lasagne, and he said that\u0027s the best lasagne we\u0027ve had for ages.\u0027         Up close and personal. Sophie said you can trick people into eating pheasant by disguising it as something they recognise And Matthew, also 43, actually refused to believe that Sophie had used game in the Italian dish.She eventually had to fish the pheasant feathers and carcass out of the bin to prove it.\u0027I\u0027ve come across a huge number of friends who have been the same, and refused to eat pheasant if I\u0027ve cooked it for a dinner party,\u0027 Sophie said.\u0027So I\u0027ve been experimenting on them and not telling them.\u0027Half the time, if you turn it into something that people recognise then you can almost trick them into believing it\u0027s what they think it is.\u0027They are not expecting these meals to contain anything other than beef, lamb or pork.\u0027And the results were great, diners loved Sophie\u0027s secret pheasant dishes.She explained: \u0027My husband, and a couple of friends said, you might be on to something here.\u0027While several butchers were doing game pasties, no one was creating healthy ready meals from the birds.But she thought wrapping up the meat in pastry, or deep frying it, lost the health benefits.         Time to tuck in! Sophie is pictured above with what looks to be a Italian style dish which she has cooked up Sophie continued: \u0027Pheasant is readily available, relatively inexpensive, and no one wants to do the gory bit - the plucking and everything else.\u0027So I thought present it as something people recognise, and they\u0027ll be more likely to give it a go.\u0027Sophie set up her business and began approaching shoots.It was an environment she was very comfortable in due to her Highland upbringing.Her father still shoots regularly, and her grandfather shot as well.She quickly agreed a deal with two local shoots - one near Ripon and the other at Easingwold, both North Yorks.The day after the hunt, Sophie drives down in her old Range Rover and fills up the boot with the birds.Sometimes she will pick up just a dozen and other times almost 200 pheasants.The number depends on the skill of shooters and also the weather.\u0027They are not too pongy, as all the birds have been in chillers,\u0027 Sophie explained.She lugs them back to the beautiful, detached cottage she and Matthew share with their two cocker iels near Boroughbridge, North Yorks.Sophie then begins the arduous task of plucking and gutting them in the garage.This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 10 hours depending on the number of birds.But Sophie keeps herself entertained.\u0027The wonders of technology mean I can rig the iPad up in the garage, and watch TV while I\u0027m doing it,\u0027 she said.Unsurprisingly, she watches cooking shows to while away the hours spent plucking.The first dish Sophie came up with was the lasagne she used to trick Matthew.She also makes bolognese, cottage pie and chilli con pheasant.Particularly popular are the Black Sheep ale and pheasant casserole, and also coq au vin with local wine.She batch cooks all of the dishes in her Aga, before packaging them up ready for the microwave.Over the hunting season - from October to February - Sophie says she makes hundreds of ready meals.\u0027I think it can work in anything, it\u0027s so versatile,\u0027 she said.\u0027Back in the day, people would hang the birds for a couple of weeks and it would have a much stronger gamier flavour.\u0027The majority of people\u0027s palettes these days aren\u0027t particularly up for that.\u0027The boozy ones in particular do very well.\u0027Sophie has lots of tasters at the Yorkshire markets she sells the ready meals at.She cooks a pheasant version of crispy duck, which is especially popular.\u0027When people do stop and try it, they tend to buy it,\u0027 she revealed happily.In the age of heavy industrialised meat production, Sophie\u0027s method harks back to simpler times when Brits ate what they hunted from the land.The meals are also far more sustainable than domestically farmed chicken, being sourced from the Yorkshire dales just half an hour from her front door.Many chefs across the UK are now looking to reconnect with the British countryside by using more game in their dishes.British Game Alliance founder Tom Adams said the birds were a good option for those wishing to lower their carbon footprint.\u0027As well as enjoying a longer, better quality of life, wild game also has a lower carbon footprint than most mass-produced meats,\u0027 he said.\u0027The industry is essential to the management and maintenance of countryside environments.\u0027The UK\u0027s largest shooting organisation, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, explained the sport is worth £2 billion each year to the UK economy, and supports 74,000 full-time jobs.Spokeswoman Debbie Collins said: \u0027Game meat is great - pheasant not only tastes delicious but is also healthy and sustainable.\u0027It is low in fat and loaded with protein and vitamins.\u0027It is a seasonal, local, versatile and nutritious food source.\u0027Initiatives to open up the market and encourage more people to try it for themselves are welcomed.\u0027Sophie\u0027s recipes sound delicious. Good luck to her.\u0027And growing up in the glens of Scotland, from a family of shooters, the industry is close to Sophie\u0027s heart.She added: \u0027There\u0027s often this perception that shooting is just for toffs, but the money it ploughs into the economy is staggering.\u0027It really is a way of life for a lot of people in the countryside.\u0027At the moment Sophie\u0027s tasty game ready meals are only available at markets across Yorkshire.But after this season ends, she will begin working on a website to deliver them across the country.Eventually she hopes to stock her ready meals in supermarkets and reach a wider audience of the wonders of wild game.And if she can convince her husband to eat pheasant regularly, then many more diners are likely to enjoy these unique ready meals. "},{"url":null,"title":"Is worlds grumpiest dog Meet Chico pint sized pooch permanent scowl","story":"Share this article \u0027I wasn\u0027t sure if that was something that would change when his puppy teeth fell out but I hoped it would not.

As a result, he was hired by Tina Brown as Tatler’s society photographer, with an insider’s eye for the edge between observation and satire. When Brown moved to New York in 1984 to edit Vanity Fair, Jones moved too, in 1988.Nearly a decade later, in 1997, he was sent to photograph Vanity Fair’s annual Oscars bash by Brown’s successor as editor, Graydon Carter. He was struggling to find a good image until he noticed Mick Jagger sitting by himself looking bored, the world’s least likely wallflower. “Madonna crossed the room and sat down next to him,” Jones recalls. “She started talking and he became quite animated. Then Tony Curtis came along and sat down at the same table on the other side and started monopolising Madonna. Jagger was on his own again and looked miserable.”For whatever reason, the magazine did not use the picture – perhaps it did not want to advertise its own party as the place where Mick Jagger had no mates – but it was part of a selection of Vanity Fair photos for the National Portrait Gallery, and is included in a new exhibition of Jones’s work at the Leica Gallery. Jones left Vanity Fair not long after this picture was taken to join Brown at her ill-fated Talk publishing venture with Harvey Weinstein.

Should the Royal Mint have used an Oxford comma on its Brexit 50p piece?Three million coins bearing the slogan “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations” are due to enter circulation from 31 January, with Sajid Javid, chancellor of the exchequer, expressing his hope that the commemorative coin will mark “the beginning of this new chapter” as the UK leaves the European Union.However, early responses include His Dark Materials novelist Philip Pullman’s criticism of its punctuation.“The ‘Brexit’ 50p coin is missing an Oxford comma, and should be boycotted by all literate people,” wrote the novelist on Twitter, while Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell wrote that, while it was “not perhaps the only objection” to the Brexit-celebrating coin, “the lack of a comma after ‘prosperity’ is killing me”.The quote echoes Thomas Jefferson’s first inaugural address as US president in 1801, when he laid out the “essential principles” of his government – including (and note the comma usage) “peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none”. A plan to produce a commemorative Brexit coin last year had to be abandoned because it was marked with the original departure date of 31 October.The criticism of the new coins follows the Bank of England’s decision to use a quote on its Jane Austen bank note about the joys of reading – apparently unaware that the character who utters the words has no interest in reading. Ireland’s Central Bank, meanwhile, misquoted Ulysses on a commemorative coin intended to honour James Joyce.The Oxford, or serial, comma is included before the final “and” in lists. It has fierce defenders and equally fierce detractors – in 2011, when it was erroneously reported that the Oxford comma was being dropped by the University of Oxford style guide, one punctuation lover asked: “Are you people insane? The Oxford comma is what separates us from the animals.”According to the  style guide, straightforward lists do not need an Oxford comma, but it can sometimes help the reader – and it is sometimes essential. “Compare: ‘I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling’ with ‘I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling’.”The Associated Press is similarly cautious about coming down on one side of the debate. “We say: If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma. But: If a comma doesn’t help make clear what is being said, don’t use it. ‘The flag is red, white and blue’ is clear. Put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction. For example: I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast.”In 2017, however, the lack of an Oxford comma helped a group of Maine dairy drivers in a dispute about overtime pay. The state’s law had said that the following activities did not count for overtime pay: “The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of: (1) Agricultural produce (2) Meat and fish products and (3) Perishable foods.” The drivers had said that because there was no comma between “packing for shipment” and “or distribution”, the law was referring to the single activity of “packing”, not to “packing” and “distribution” as two separate activities. And as the drivers distributed, but did not pack, the goods, this would make them eligible for overtime pay. The judge sided with the drivers.“For want of a comma, we have this case,” he wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35181e39cfb0c457f38b979818979da1036098e2/0_43_2800_1681/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c62202774b348a9d2f17da647c6f4ce9","title":"uk banks mortgages interest rates","story":"Bank of England could be more likely to leave interest rates on hold amid property upturnThe number of mortgages approved by Britain’s high street banks jumped to the highest level for almost five years in December, in the latest sign of a revival in the housing market.Mortgage approvals for house purchases increased to 46,815 in December compared with 44,058 a month earlier, according to UK Finance – hitting the highest level since April 2015.The trade body that represents major high street banks across the country said the value of mortgage lending increased the most since March 2016, rising by a net £3.8bn.The figures come as the Bank of England weighs cutting interest rates on Thursday after the UK economy flatlined at the end of last year amid intense political uncertainty over Brexit and the snap general election.Retail sales unexpectedly plunged in December while inflation dropped in a reflection of weakness in the economy at the end of the year. However, a rise in mortgage borrowing and business confidence since Boris Johnson’s election victory could encourage the Bank to leave rates on hold.According to the property website Rightmove, house prices rose on the month in December at the fastest rate on record for the time of the year, as buyers and sellers felt more confident about the outlook for the housing market.Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said it was highly likely that mortgage approvals were significantly lifted by increased confidence and lower levels of uncertainty since the election.“Prior to November, mortgage approvals for house purchases had fallen back for three successive months to be at a seven-month low in October, indicating that activity was being pressurised by heightened uncertainties over the domestic political situation and Brexit,” he said.Andrew Montlake, the managing director of the mortgage broker Coreco, said the outlook for the housing market would depend on the next phase of the Brexit talks with Brussels, as the government attempts to strike a trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020.“It goes without saying that a huge amount is riding on the outcome of the trade negotiations and so there is still the potential for significant volatility,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f9d4ad94ac96511a7f2414561cf1bddd33c9f0c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e81530d035155336a113d3799cfb183","title":"artificial intelligence computer novels fiction write books","story":"The first computer-generated screenplays are promised within five years. Fiction can’t be far behindRoland Barthes was speaking metaphorically when he suggested in 1967 that “the birth of the reader must be ransomed by the death of the author”. But as artificial intelligence takes its first steps in fiction writing, it seems technology may one day start to make Barthes’ metaphor all too real.AI is still some way off writing a coherent novel, as surreal experiments with Harry Potter show, but the future isn’t so far away in Hollywood. According to Nadira Azermai, whose company ScriptBook is developing a screenwriting AI: “Within five years we’ll have scripts written by AI that you would think are better than human writing.”Self-promotion aside, if there is the possibility of a decent screenplay from ScriptBook’s AI within five years, then a novel composed by machines can’t be far behind. But it’s hard to shake the impression that, even if such novels eventually turn out to be “better than human writing”, something would be lost.Perhaps the feeling comes from an idea that would be anathema to Barthes: the idea of literature as communication.If a book is “a heart that only beats in the chest of another”, as Rebecca Solnit suggests, then it seems two parties are required: someone to write and someone to read. So when AI writes fiction there seems to be a missing piece, a void at the heart of the text where meaning should reside.Barthes would have none of this, of course, insisting that “it is language which speaks, not the author”. In terms which strikingly anticipate the workings of software currently at the cutting edge of artificial writing, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2, he argues that a text is not a “line of words … releasing a single … meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author-God)”, but instead a “tissue of citations, resulting from the thousand sources of culture”. “The writer can only imitate a gesture forever anterior, never original,” Barthes continues. “If he wants to express himself … the internal ‘thing’ he claims to ‘translate’ is itself only a readymade dictionary whose words can be explained (defined) only by other words, and so on ad infinitum.”And he must be on to something. Imagine yourself, some years in the future, pulling a novel by an unknown author off the shelves and finding that it is really good. Would you be any less moved by the story if you were then told it had been produced using groundbreaking AI? If all you had were the words in front of you on the page, how would you even know? Those who scoff at the idea that AI could ever pass this literary Turing test haven’t been paying attention for the past 50 years. Computers can now drive cars, recognise faces, translate between languages, fill in as your personal assistant, even beat the world champion at Go – achievements that are often dismissed as “just computation” even though an expert of the 1970s would have classed any one of them as a signature ability of human intelligence.Should publishers decide the future of literature is written in code, there may still be some hope for authors. A shift to AI-generated novels could only ever be a short-term strategy. As Barthes intuited and OpenAI’s latest algorithm demonstrates, it’s certainly possible to assemble writing from other writing. But even if this patchwork prose becomes “better than human writing”, it would be only drawing on a finite well of inspiration. Train your AI on the sum total of human literature thus far and all you’ll get is a mass of references: “a gesture forever anterior, never original”. No one who witnessed the phenomenon that was the Fifty Shades of Grey series could doubt that imitation can be lucrative for a while. But when even an imitator as skilful or as lucky as EL James finds her sales on a downward curve it’s clear that no matter how feisty your stallion at first appears, flogging it will only get you so far.Barthes’ belief in the primacy of the word, his dogged insistence that “life can only imitate the book”, leaves his recipe for literature missing a vital ingredient: the inidual experience that any human writer facing the blank page cannot avoid. Without the raw input of the complicated business that is life, even the most talented AI can only rearrange the books it ingested in its training – enough for a few good years in publishing, perhaps, but hardly a sustainable model for literary culture.Maybe I’m thinking too small. Maybe any publisher looking forward to the death of the author would only need to expand the training programme for their writing machines. Perhaps they could hook their AIs up to the daily news, wire them into Spotify, encourage them to make new friends on Twitter – and feed it all back into the work. The resulting algorithms would be very different to human beings, of course. But perhaps they would be enough like thinking, feeling beings that their fiction would be communicating something rather marvellous after all.• Richard Lea writes for  books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d46eedec63e40d387ecf300a54458fd466246726/0_0_5926_3556/master/5926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c68ab182e0662c53f45cd4e6fc102989","title":"coronavirus panic uk hostile environment east asians","story":"Stereotypes are spreading as quickly as the virus. On the bus, in the street, people have started treating us as if we’re infectedThe atmosphere on my morning commute is tense. As panic over the coronavirus deepens and dominates the headlines, as an east Asian I can’t help but feel more and more uncomfortable. On the bus to work last week, as I sat down, the man next to me immediately scrambled to gather his stuff and stood up to avoid sitting next to me.On the train over the weekend, a group sat opposite me chattering about their weekend plans. One of them seriously advised the rest, “I wouldn’t go to Chinatown if I were you, they have that disease.”As I made my way towards Chinatown in London, an elderly woman and her friend on the escalators at Leicester Square underground station were casually talking about how dangerous the area now was, and she complained she was obliged to go there for a meeting. “At least I’m old, I have nothing left to lose,” she laughed.In another loud conversation, I overheard a woman talking about how terrified she was that her friend, who had spent some time working with Chinese students, might have infected her with the virus.In light of current events, we east Asians in the UK are on high alert, paying close attention to how people interact with us. It is not their concern about health that is problematic, but the stereotyping of all east Asians as a coronavirus risk. At times such as this, even a simple bus trip can feel like a hostile environment.A friend at a university library experienced something similar: as soon as they sat down at a desk, the person in front of them packed up their things to leave. We’re noticing odd things like this that we never saw happen before.Perhaps it did not occur to some of these people, so happy to talk loudly in front of me, that I was also concerned about the virus – or that I, as a British citizen, was no more likely than them to be carrying the virus. They grouped all east Asian people together, without factoring in that perhaps we were British or, if not, we were from unaffected areas of China, or even came from other countries in the Chinese diaspora. We were all the same to them.The virus that originated in Wuhan has spread to at least eight other countries including Thailand, Japan, Australia and the US, and it’s “highly likely” it will reach the UK, according to Public Health England. As it spreads, the virus has revealed more and more stereotyped judgments about Chinese people. I have also heard accounts from east Asians, even if they are not Chinese, who have recently been profiled while travelling at airports or on trains due to the ignorant perception that all east Asians are Chinese. George Osborne, editor of the Evening Standard, proudly tweeted his newspaper’s cartoon of a rat with a face mask to supposedly commemorate the lunar new year. Piers Morgan mocked the Chinese language on Good Morning Britain with a tired “ching chang chong” joke. East Asians have been accused of instigating the virus by having “revolting” eating habits. Most Asians know these stereotypes all too well.These insulting depictions don’t reflect the reality of being Chinese at all, and encourage the misguided perception of more than one billion people being a monolithic and singular group in which everyone speaks, acts and looks the same. In fact, there is a huge ersity.Language and culture vary massively within the region. Speakers of Hokkien would not be able to converse with people who speak Hakka. And despite Mandarin being the lingua franca, there are more than 200 dialects spoken across China. In fact in Wuhan itself, a beautiful and erse city with more than 3,500 years of history, many of its population of 11.8 million speak a Wuhan dialect.Elsewhere, natives of Aksu look completely different to the majority Han Chinese. And the food, too: dim sum from the south of China is vastly different from the tangy, spicy flavours of Sichuan.This week, my ethnicity has made me feel like I was part of a threatening and diseased mass. To see me as someone who carries the virus just because of my race is, well, just racist. As the lunar new year celebrations take place across the world, let’s take a moment to think about the way in which east Asians are perceived and how important it is to see us in all our ersity, as inidual human beings, and to challenge stereotypes. The coronavirus is a human tragedy, so let’s not allow fear to breed hatred, intolerance and racism.• Sam Phan is an MA student at the University of Manchester"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a6fb42ebeb8693ce02cf55ef6a337bd44f6c90/726_98_4274_2565/master/4274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=912fd4eabf839e4cfc94af3a522ae6c2","title":"first uk climate assembly birmingham sir david attenborough","story":"Sir David Attenborough thanked the 110 people gathered in Birmingham for giving up their timeOn the 16th floor of Birmingham’s Park Regis hotel, glass walls provide sweeping views of the city skyline, along with a long backlog of cars on the motorway outside – but transport is just one of many issues the 110 people gathered here will have to grapple with as they decide how the UK should respond to the climate crisis.People travelled from all over the country for the first meeting of the UK climate assembly on Saturday. Over four weekends they will discuss a range of issues with experts and decide on a set of recommendations for how the government can reach its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.Assembly member Leia, 20, from Darlington, said giving up her time for the cause was an easy decision to make: “You don’t get an opportunity to influence government policy very often and climate change is really important.”Another participant, Amanda, 56, a healthcare project manager from Kent, said: “I was really chuffed to be chosen. There were some things which I didn’t know about that I’ve learned today, which is really interesting, but I’ve always been quite green.”Invitations to the assembly were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random, and of the over 1,500 people who responded asking to be considered, 110 were selected by a computer to be representative of society. There’s a mix of ages, genders, ethnic backgrounds and education levels, but also a range of views about the climate crisis.A citizens’ assembly is a group of people brought together to discuss an issue or issues, and reach a conclusion about what they think should happen, according to\u0026nbspthe definition\u0026nbspput forward by the House of Commons library.Citizens’ assemblies give members of the public the time and opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic, before reaching conclusions. Assembly members are asked to make trade-offs and arrive at workable recommendations.Facilitated by experts and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, members meet over a series of weekends with the goal of removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion.The people who take part are chosen randomly so they reflect the wider population in terms of demographics – age, gender, ethnicity and social class.The number of members involved can vary. A recent citizens’ assembly, formed to examine social care provision in England, had 47 members who were English citizens and eligible to vote in UK general elections.Citizens’ assemblies, and other similar methods, have been used in the UK and other countries, including Australia, Canada and the US, to address a range of complex issues. One of the most prominent to take place in recent years was the assembly established by the Irish parliament to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue.Chris, a 32-year-old production engineer and father of two from Oxford, was unsure of the severity of the problem. “I wasn’t sure if it was a crisis. I’m not a climate denier as people will quite quickly say. Climate is real, it does change, it has changed. I appreciate man is changing it. But whether we’re at the level of crisis – I hadn’t seen enough information.”He was keen to hear directly from experts, and was pleased to see opinions being distinguished from facts. “My biggest fear coming here is that a decision would be made purely based on emotion with no logical steps or thought about the implementation or the impact.”The assembly heard from speakers at organisations including Natural England, the New Economics Foundation and Wellcome, and were given the chance to ask questions. Some of these were practical – “What’s more environmentally friendly, British beef or avocados?” – while some were more ethical – “How can we ensure the cost of changes don’t affect poorer people disproportionately?”Participants could hold up a yellow card if a speaker was going too fast, or a red card if they needed something explained or clarified. “It’s about distilling down the enormous complexity of climate change into small pieces of information that are accessible, balanced and meaningful for people, so it is quite a tall order,” said Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, the director of the UK Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations, and one of the assembly’s expert leads.“Some people are probably totally comfortable with a lot of what’s been covered today, and some people will have never really heard anything of this kind before.”The day culminated with a talk from Sir David Attenborough, who was keen to give his thanks to the volunteers for giving up their time.“If you have a parliament of a fixed length of five years, it is very difficult to persuade politicians that they should give money and time and attention and worry to an issue which is not going to come to a climax – and people won’t know if it is successful or not successful – for 10 years, 15 years hence,” he said.“Your very existence here means members of parliament are taking it seriously. The people in this country ought to be extremely grateful to you, as indeed am I.”Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, observed the morning session and said she was impressed by the level of engagement from members. “The buzz in the room was brilliant. I just think it’s so important that politics is done with people, not to them … Look what happened with the gilets jaunes in Paris – people have to understand and feel as if they are part of the process.”She said her biggest concern was that the assembly discussions were based on the assumption that net-zero emissions should be achieved by 2050 and not earlier, but organisers said there would be time at the end of the process for members to discuss this if they wanted to.The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.

The harness was embroidered with buckles that looked like horse shoes, Texan stars and gold coins with the Versace logo on them. Meanwhile, Charles Anderson from the band Social House wore a bespoke ice-cubed-silver harness from Louis Vuitton featuring customised orange patches.The harness has become a regular feature on the red carpet (Kerry Washington wore a diamond-encrusted one at the Golden Globes earlier this month): a subversive note for traditionally conservative red-carpet dress. It helped that the Grammys were noticeably erse and unique (shout out to Steve Lacey in his Comme des Garçons skirt and Billy Porter’s hat with its “automatic doors” fringe feature).Anderson’s harness was made for Louis Vuitton by Virgil Abloh, who put Timothée Chalamet in a black bedazzled one at the Golden Globes in 2019 – disrupting men’s red-carpet looks for ever after.The harness falls into a menswear trend for next season: Berghain-like, S\u0026ampM-referencing looks crept into the autumnwinter menswear shows earlier this month, with looks that were sexy and strange, hinting at a sense of collective anxiety with a hint of dystopia.

He insists any sexual encounters were consensual.Haleyi, whose legal name is Miriam Haley, will be the first of the two women whose accusations are at the heart of the charges against Weinstein to take the stand at the closely watched #MeToo-era trial, which is entering its fourth day of testimony.Last week, Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra testified that Weinstein raped her after barging into her apartment in the mid-1990s. While outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges, Sciorra’s allegations could be a factor as prosecutors look to prove Weinstein has engaged in a pattern of predatory behavior.Haleyi went public with her allegations at an October 2017 news conference, appearing alongside lawyer Gloria Allred, who also represents Sciorra and other Weinstein accusers.Haleyi said she met Weinstein while in her 20s at the 2004 London premiere of the Leonardo DiCaprio film The Aviator. They crossed paths again at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006 and when she expressed interest in working on one of his productions he invited her to his hotel room and asked for a massage.Haleyi said she refused, replying: “No sorry, I’m not a masseuse.”More meetings followed, and Weinstein secured Haleyi a job helping on the set of Project Runway, a reality competition show he produced. Later, she said, he invited her to attend a fashion show in Paris, but she declined by bringing up his sketchy reputation.The alleged assault occurred at Weinstein’s Soho apartment after he sent a car to pick Haleyi up for what she thought was a friendly meeting about her career.Instead, she said, Weinstein pushed her on to a bed and forced his mouth onto her genitals. She said she tried to get him to stop, even telling him she was menstruating, but he wouldn’t relent.“I was mortified. I was in disbelief and disgusted,” she said.In opening statements, prosecutor Meghan Hast said there was a subsequent hotel room encounter that Haleyi did not reveal in 2017. Hast said that though Haleyi didn’t want to have intercourse with Weinstein, she kept still and “let him degrade her”.In testifying, Haleyi will have to deal with a defense team that said it plans to confront Weinstein’s accusers with their own words – messages they exchanged with Weinstein well after the alleged assaults. Weinstein’s lawyers argue the positive-sounding emails and texts call into question the accusers’ accounts.Some of Haleyi’s messages were made public last year when Weinstein’s lawyers sought to get his case dismissed. One sent to Weinstein’s phone in 2007 reads: “Hi! Just wondering if u have any news on whether Harvey will have time to see me before he leaves? X Miriam.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/171f1b61061778f7545a93623bf9f9bdc4246543/0_24_4195_2518/master/4195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=541257cf7dc7821164fe98fbf1d9e200","title":"kobe bryant dear basketball a love letter to a sport that is now a poignant epitaph","story":"The NBA star’s Oscar-winning short film, in which he mused on his post-basketball future, now has a new layer of sadness and ironyDear Basketball was always a bittersweet piece of work. This was the Oscar-winning short film from 2017 directed by the Disney animator Glen Keane, with stirring music by John Williams and written, produced and narrated by Kobe Bryant, on the occasion of his retirement from basketball.It is not merely a love letter to the sport that had given him so much, but a deeply sad farewell to it: almost an expression of grief, or therapy for grief. In the previous few years, he had been agonised by injuries that were making continued top-flight competition an impossibility the fragility of human bodies is always a particular agony for athletes of Bryant’s calibre. “I can’t love you obsessively for much longer,” Bryant says to basketball. “My body knows it’s time to say goodbye.” Now, of course, these thoughts have a new layer of sadness, as well as a jarring irony. The goodbye that Bryant envisaged in Dear Basketball was a natural progression to other things, and he mused on what his post-basketball career was going to bring him. Clearly, some work in movies was a very real possibility. But it was not to be.Dear Basketball is also a tender meditation on Bryant’s own boyhood: the fluid pencil-stroke-style animation morphs the adult Bryant back and forth between a stylised representation of his magnificent triumphs on the court with Bryant as the little kid in his bedroom dreaming of glory. He was the basketball-obsessed kid who took his dad’s tube socks, rolled them up into a ball and kept shooting it into a little hoop on the other side of the room. The dad in question is the former professional player and coach Joe Bryant, who survives his son at the age of 65.Dear Basketball starts with the ecstatic moment of scoring, the transcendental moment of pure success as the ball dunks down into the hoop with such conviction and force that the netting floats up it’s a thrill that never gets old. Yet the emphatic beats of a sporting narrative are blurred and softened by the visual style. The animation itself is something that confers a kind of nostalgia on both Bryant’s older and younger self. It’s very different from watching basketball live or on TV, and maybe the film sentimentalises a sport that incorporates such blaringly commercial ingredients – but it is allowable, for a film that is explicitly about Bryant saying goodbye, and heading off into a different future that he admits he still cannot quite envisage.There is something arguably childlike about someone expressing pure, passionate love not for people, but for a sport, incarnated in the ball itself. But there is a heart-wrenching honesty in it as well. Dear Basketball is a melancholy, thoughtful film. Now as his epitaph, it is desperately poignant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/271b08e039341a07fbad581a64376a6a2d78b3cd/0_3198_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c4443a0f93861a33507befbc1951a76","title":"observer food monthly 20 best potato recipes","story":"Roasted, chipped, mashed: a celebration of the power of the potatoLancashire hotpot, fisherman’s pie, Jane Grigson’s shepherd’s pie: few foods comfort like an old-school potato dish.

He has even made us chicken soup for lunch which, on a midwinter afternoon, is as tasty as it is comforting. The world outside might be reeling but here, in the affluent enclave of Barnes, it is easier to feel sanguine. As the BBC’s highest-paid presenter, Lineker is seemingly insulated from the world’s miseries and woes. Yet he is also one of the most politically outspoken and compassionate people in British sport and, as a waspish critic of Brexit, he is entitled to feel gloomy that the UK will leave the European Union on Friday.Instead, he is resigned to a reality he has argued against for four years. “I find it difficult to comprehend,” Lineker says. “But it’s a done deal, so get on with it now. I don’t tweet about it any more. Some people keep going on about it – but I’m not going to bother saying: ‘I told you so.’”Football is a consolation and, for the next 80 minutes, Lineker is engaging company. Britain has become even more insular but he is still in thrall to a worldly game. It hardly matters that Jürgen Klopp is German, or Pep Guardiola is from Catalonia, as Lineker celebrates the “unprecedented” football played by Liverpool and Manchester City in the last few years. Football, for all its ills, looks much less parochial than British politics and so it seems appropriate, this week, to ask Lineker more about Brexit.In his new acceptance of Brexit, can he now see any advantages in leaving the EU? “I’m hoping there will be. I haven’t seen any yet. We might become a unified nation and throw the flag around.”Lineker offers a weary smile which is soon replaced by sheer pleasure as he turns to the game he loves. “We’re seeing football that’s unprecedented for a variety of reasons but, obviously, there’s the influence of Pep and of Klopp. They’re contrasting, but they’re both exhilarating. They are certainly in the top five coaches, perhaps even the top two, in world football. Their different styles add to the rivalry. I love them both but Klopp’s probably more engaging. You can see Pep’s pretty intense in his post-match interviews. He’s hard work whereas Klopp can always put it on. I guess we’ve seen Pep’s dark side.“But what Guardiola’s done is special. He was a very young coach at Barcelona but he still transformed their players. Obviously they played a system based on Cruyff – which both Pep and I played under at Barça. That’s to make the pitch as big as you can when you’ve got the ball, and then shrink it when you haven’t. Klopp introduced his own style – this dynamic high-octane pressing game. It’s generated fitness and mental belief within his players. What Klopp did at Dortmund was remarkable and what he’s built at Liverpool is even better. He’s obviously been involved in recruitment and that’s crucial.“They’ve got lots of special players, particularly up front with the big three. But Trent is very special. He’s one of those players I watch every game and see three or four things from him that I go: ‘Oh my God.’ Like the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona with that quick corner. What a remarkable thing for a kid to do – to have that gall and bravery against some of the world’s best players. That could’ve ended up looking stupid but he’s smart. I interviewed him a year ago at his home. He was very shy and you can be kidded by a soft scouse accent but this kid’s really intelligent.”Lineker tells a story of how he lost a game of pool in Alexander-Arnold’s kitchen. “It was like his life depended on it. I could see myself in him. That competitive side. But he’s so freaky. That taught me a lot about his attitude.”Has this season been overshadowed by Liverpool’s domination? “The brilliance of Liverpool has made it interesting even though they could win it in March, which is remarkable. So it’s been enthralling. But it’ll even itself out if City get their central defence sorted next season.”Is he concerned about the decline of the top two’s usual rivals? “People go: ‘What’s happened to Man United?’ But football’s cyclical and it was always going to be very difficult for United after Fergie. It’s the same at Arsenal. Soon as you lose such a massive personality, who was so dominant in running the club, it’s going to take an era, a decade or so, to turn it right. Football fans are not patient. But when it gets better again, it’ll actually be good. It’s sometimes good to suffer to savour the best moments.”Who would Lineker have loved to play for – Guardiola or Klopp? “That’s a great question. Sometimes I think Klopp, sometimes Guardiola. They both improve players but I’d be more suited to Man City. At Liverpool the front three drop a lot into midfield and that was not my great strength. I was more the side-on striker who likes to spin behind. More like Agüero. I’d score a hell of a lot of goals for City. But I would’ve adapted to Liverpool. I always think holding the ball up was difficult, but I remind myself the pitches we played on were shit.“That’s the one thing I’m envious about now. The playing surfaces today are like billiard tables. When I played, once you got past August it started cutting up. Then it got heavy. It got frosty. Then when it dried, you got bouncy. The pitches were more testing than the opposition sometimes. You get balls rattled into you, and it’s bouncing all over the place. Now it’s ‘boom-boom-boom’. It’s made the game so much better.“You also can’t just kick people any more. Imagine Messi in the 80s. Like Maradona they’d be whacking him down. One of the things I love about Messi is he never play-acts and he always tries desperately to stay on his feet. But if he’d played in the 80s, when basically you had to commit GBH to get sent off, it would have been harder. But there’ve been a lot of changes in football. The grounds are better – modern and beautiful. And it’s still loved. While there’s always a dark side to football, it’s better placed than it’s ever been.”Is Klopp’s current Liverpool side among the best teams he has seen? “Unquestionably. Man City also. Their numbers in a competitive league tell you that. The game evolves and so, if you put my team from 1990 against a modern team, we’d get murdered. But if we had time to adapt, the best players then would still be among the best now.”“I told them what I think VAR should be. The referee on the pitch needs a mate sitting with all these monitors. He’s watching the game and he lets it go, lets it go, and then he says: ‘Mate, you absolutely fucked up there. You’ve got to change that otherwise you’re going to look a complete dick.’ That stops the MaradonaThierry Henry handballs. The absolute howler. That’s all you need VAR for.”Unlike Peter Shilton, whom I interviewed recently, Lineker is admirably philosophical about Maradona’s Hand of God goal from the 1986 World Cup. “The Diego thing doesn’t bother me. Never has. He got away with it. I would never think of doing it but some Argentinian footballers grew up in the roughest conditions. They were ready to do anything to win.”Lineker laughs. “Anyway, if we’d had VAR it would have been 1-0 to us and I scored the winner. Happy days.”It is 30 years this summer since Italia 90 when Lineker and England were knocked out of the World Cup semi-finals by Germany. “I look back with a mixture of joy, because we were such a good side, and a feeling we didn’t do ourselves justice. We didn’t always play well. Cameroon were brilliant in the quarters. They outplayed us most of the game but Shilts made three world-class saves. I scored the two penalties and we won. Then Germany. I only watched it back a couple of years ago. I didn’t realise we were that good. We were the better side.“Italia 90 was a watershed for English football. Post-Hillsborough, post-Heysel, post-awful 80s hooliganism, it wasn’t just a working class sport anymore. It was the national sport for everybody. Women and the middle classes became interested. The reaction after 1986 was extraordinary but 1990 – my God.”That tournament propelled Lineker towards his role at the BBC – which is again beset by problems. “The BBC is something that I am genuinely passionate about,” Lineker says. “I’ve worked with them for 25 years. And I think it’s something we should be proud of in this country.“It’s really difficult for the BBC,” he admits. “They are the standard bearer and balance is difficult. Both the right wing and the left wing complain like mad that the BBC are biased. The truth is the BBC is full of thousands of people with varying political views. To say the BBC is fundamentally leftist, or fundamentally rightist, is wrong. It’s been a difficult time because of Brexit and people have been very tribal. But the BBC is unbelievably respected around the world.“The licence fee is our fundamental problem. You’re forced to pay it if you want a TV, and therefore it’s a tax. The public pay our salaries, so everyone is a target. I would make the licence fee voluntary. I’ve always said for a long time, I would make it voluntary. I don’t know the logistics of how it would work. You would lose some people, but at the same time you’d up the price a bit. It’s the price of a cup of coffee a week at the moment. If you put it up you could help older people, or those that can’t afford it.”Does his position at the BBC, and over Brexit, expose him to the threat of physical attack? “No, it’s remarkable. For all the grief I occasionally get on Twitter, people are a lot kinder face to face. I’ve only had one incident. About two years ago I was getting the train at Euston to Manchester. I got shoved in the back. I turned around and it was a little old lady. She’s going: ‘You let her in?’ I think she was talking about the girl who came back from Isis – which I made no comment on. She said: ‘You let her in, have her in your house. Effing this, effing that.’ She was on her way to a Tommy Robinson rally outside the BBC. But people are usually incredibly warm.”As Lineker stretches out on his sofa for a photo in his front room, I remind him he will turn 60 this year.“Yeah,” he says wryly, “but it’s just a number. I’m still in good shape. Seventy is the one to worry about. I would love another 10 years of working like this and having a good time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77407830adec2402c4e71f0323d45d0f40a4cb6b/2_81_2174_1304/master/2174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bc3e4912ae6a31ea55cb22a932a1c07","title":"manchester united ready to ramp up pursuit of sporting lisbon bruno fernandes","story":"Manchester United are considering a fresh bid for Sporting Lisbon’s Bruno Fernandes, with negotiations set to be ramped up before Friday’s 11pm transfer deadline.United had an offer of €45m (£38m) plus add-ons for the 25-year-old midfielder rejected by Sporting, who value Fernandes at €85m.

There will often be dozens of people visiting the target address, causing antisocial behaviour, dealing and using drugs.“Housing associations are eyes and ears on the ground. More and more housing officers are reporting the signs of county lines and cuckooing to us. We are getting more calls than ever from housing associations asking for help with this issue.”Burton points to high-rise blocks where vulnerable people, who may have learning disabilities or mental health problems, can become isolated. “They are befriended and next thing they know the flat is taken over and someone from the gang is sleeping in the box room. A housing association can join up the dots they have always been there on the ground.”The ultimate legal sanction to stop cuckooing in a property is a premises closure, and these are on the rise across the UK. With the National Housing Federation, Forbes is lobbying for housing providers to have more statutory powers to close properties where there is evidence they are used for exploitation.But while Burton and his colleagues do work with the police, they also try to use street-level knowledge of families to help in other ways.“For example, one property we are looking at, it’s a hive of activity and the police know about it. So that might result in a premises closure. But we always start at the point that legal action is the last resort, particularly where there is a young person or family involved.“We have a case where a young person is living with his grandfather because his parents can’t look after him due to drug problems of their own. He gets involved in postcode gangs and bringing knives and drugs into the property. His grandfather is worried but the local housing association know this family because they have been in the area a long time so are able to offer help.”The firm has joined with Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Organised Crime Unit to build a network across the region looking for solutions.In one case where a man was dealing drugs from a property, the firm worked with police and a housing association to get a partial closure, which allowed the man’s partner and children to keep using the home but barred other visitors.Detective Inspector Andy Farrell of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit told the  that these partnerships are increasingly vital in fighting child exploitation.“Across the region, areas with good transport links are vulnerable to cuckooing, like Harrogate, York and then over to the coastal areas of Scarborough, high areas of social deprivation. It’s really important now that we upskill housing associations and enhance their understanding of county lines. For example, we work with them on partial home closures so we don’t leave potential victims homeless.”He believes the deeper understanding now of how exploitation works is helping to tackle the crime in the longer term. “Now we are actually understanding that children who may have been criminalised previously are actually being exploited. Let’s look at early intervention, look at siblings of those who are being exploited and how we can ert them we will hopefully see that impact in the future.”Peter Fahy was Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police until 2015 and is now chair of a housing association, Plus Dane Housing. He says housing associations have unusual access at a community level, in areas where cuts have removed many welfare checks.“I had always been struck as a police officer that the closest relationship was with the local housing association and their housing officers. We know that in our housing stock there are people who are incredibly vulnerable, the HAs will know who those vulnerable people are.“For example, housing associations go into every property at least once a year to do a gas safety check and it’s incredible what they see. You have repair staff seeing child protection issues, or noting when elderly people are incredibly vulnerable. It’s about helping these staff understand the signs and know what to do about it.”It is not just cuckooing and drug dealing that housing associations are seeing up close, Fahy says.“Cuckooing is extremely worrying, but beyond that are other things like pop-up brothels. This is an extremely crucial housing issue. Criminals take over a house for a brothel through short term lets or Airbnb. These are operated from properties with very exploited people. It’s extremely hard to get them to speak, they have a fear of the exploiter reaching right back into their own home country or their family.”“There is a very high level of drug taking in our society. If you talk to youth charities they will say there is nothing we can do – kids are offered £1,000 a day to carry drugs and it’s hard to help them once they have got involved. There is little else for them to do in their communities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

Is it time to turn them all off for good?Three years ago, Aishah Iqbal had just qualified as a doctor and was finding it a “steep learning curve”. She often felt overwhelmed at work – and whenever she took out her phone and saw “all these messages coming up”, she felt worse. “It was very easy to get distracted from why I’d pulled my phone out, or to feel like there were so many people that I needed to reply to immediately.”When we talk about the fragmenting effect of technology on our attention, or the dopamine hits that keep us refreshing our feeds as if they are buttons on fruit machines, we are often thinking about notifications: the pings, pop-ups and glowing red dots that pull us back into our phones, and push us from app to app.According to one small study conducted in 2014, mobile phone users receive an average of 63.5 alerts every day, with most viewed within minutes – whether the phone is on silent or not. A 2016 study by Deloitte found that people check their phone, on average, 47 times a day – often in response to alerts. It is hardly any wonder some people are undergoing a notification detox.These might be messages from friends, family, your boss or your bank. They might be breaking news alerts, or reminders to drink water or meditate, or simply apps alerting you to their presence on your phone. (Turn those ones off, right now.)Regardless of what the notifications say or if you opted to receive them, the cumulative effect can be overwhelming. Over the course of a day, notifications are an interruption, affecting your focus and performance.A 2015 study from Florida State University found that, among students sitting a test that required their sustained attention, any audible interruption from their phone negatively affected the results. Just hearing the ping of a notification was equally as distracting as actually taking a phone call, suggesting to the researchers that “mobile phones can disrupt attention performance even if one does not interact with the device”.It is that sense of being derailed that is increasingly leading people to turn off all (or nearly all) of their notifications. As Iqbal noticed the effect pop-ups were having on her peace of mind and productivity, she took action. “I turned everything off, and I felt better for it. That was something I could control: the distraction coming from my phone.”Iqbal, 28, now works as a paediatrician in Leicester. She is also a certified personal trainer and uses social media as a core part of her business. She manages this by only enabling badge notifications (a red dot on the icon on the homescreen, one of the least obtrusive options) for WhatsApp and one of her email addresses. She says she is less inclined to waste hours passively scrolling Facebook or Instagram after being erted there by an alert, and she no longer feels she has to reply to messages instantly. “It hasn’t crossed my mind to turn them back on.”It is only relatively recently that turning off notifications has been an option at all. After proudly publicising the 7.4tn notifications pushed through its servers in 2013, in 2018 Apple introduced features to grant users more control over how and when they were interrupted, such as a “do not disturb” function to help them “stay in the moment”. Google has rolled out similar “digital wellbeing” features for Android. Even Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, owned up to having “gutted” his own notifications, and encouraged all iPhone users to do the same. “It’s not something that is adding value to my life, or is making me a better person.”But what if it is not the technology, but ourselves that is the problem? Nir Eyal, a behavioural design expert and author of Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life says that the leading causes of distraction are internal triggers: uncertainty, stress, anxiety and fatigue. Rather than reckon with them, it can be easier to blame technology. Developers’ tactics to get us to use their apps are good, “but they’re not mind control. A lot of people like to think we’re puppets on strings. ‘Addiction’ gets tossed around all the time, but when we call it what it really is – a distraction – it becomes something we can do something about, and there’s no one to blame.”Rather than relying on willpower, Eyal favours a system (in his case, almost a microschedule) to get ahead of ersions before they happen. He says sometimes we might blame an alert from our phone for distracting us, when really we were not focused or being productive in the first place. “It’s not just about turning off notifications, it’s about knowing what you want to do with your time. You can’t call something a distraction unless you know what it is distracting you from.”Tinkering with tech also saves us from having to confront a more grim possibility: that even if it was taken off us entirely, we would still find means of distracting ourselves.Nilli Lavie, a professor of psychology and brain sciences at UCL’s Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, says her research has established a clear link between people being distracted by their mobile phones and low mood – but a very strong association was also recorded with a wandering mind in general.Another line of research has led Lavie to conclude that susceptibility to being distracted is in fact a trait – Lavie calls it “attention distractability” – that varies within the population. Though it is not yet known if, for instance, it is influenced by genetics, it is an established component of research into attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). You may not meet the clinical criteria for ADHD, but if you fall higher on what Lavie calls “the inattention spectrum”, you will be not only more vulnerable to distractions, but more consumed by them.Lavie, like Eyal, is deeply sceptical of the argument that the problem is technology: “It’s very easy to just mute it, right?” she says. Instead there is a “generalised issue of distractability”. “Obviously mobile phones do come through as a large source of distraction, but our studies also showed it’s a wider issue.”For example, says Eyal, people feeling overwhelmed might locate tech as the source when really it is their attitude to work – or their employer’s. If your boss was to call you on a landline late on a Friday night, asks Eyal: “Is it the telephone that’s at fault or the company culture that allows for that type of behaviour?”Employees of Slack, a corporate instant messaging platform that is often cited as a source of “notification spam”, are told not to use it after hours or on weekends, says Eyal – the message from the top being “work hard and go home”. It may not be notifications that we need to manage, but expectations: those of other people, and our own.When Melissa Webb, a secondary school teacher in Lincolnshire, changed jobs three years ago, her new employer’s always-on culture exacerbated her anxiety and depression to the point where she had what she terms a “breakdown”. The constant emails from parents, students and colleagues manifested as notifications – “an enormous trigger” for her at that time, she remembers.“When you’re going through mental health problems, day-to-day life is really difficult, and you might not be in the space to properly respond to someone,” she says. “I think the notifications were symbolic of the expectation that other people had of me.“You suddenly became aware that you need to be a good employee, good colleague, daughter, partner, friend. It linked into this thing of ‘I can’t be all of these things to all of these people I can’t manage this workload, this social life.’ It was too much. Sometimes the content of them doesn’t matter – it’s just the feeling that you can’t escape.”Webb, 29, is now a self-employed illustrator. She has 43,000 followers on Instagram, with whom she has frank conversations about mental health. “I’ve had very few people in real life that I’ve been able to do that with,” she says. “I never moan about tech – tech is amazing. It’s the reason why, in the last three years, I’ve been able to earn money despite not being able to be in a normal workplace.”Her notifications, however, remain mostly switched off. “It’s so simple, but it’s so helpful. It’s that feeling of being in control of your time and your energy and your emotions, which I think is really important.” Iqbal actively guards those boundaries too. About a month ago, Instagram started alerting her to direct messages. “That went off straight away. I don’t know why it happened – but it was a reminder of why I’d turned it off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eda873838f940582d1210dcf51900efad3fa8c9b/0_469_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dae5fec7edc41f83e7278dd9c95a650","title":"the truth about hydration should you drink eight glasses of water a day","story":"The 8x8 rule has become a health goal for many. But when it comes to healthy skin, eyes and having bags of energy, the research tells another storyBefore you read this article, can I just check you’ve drunk enough water today? You might want to refill your bottle because, remember, if you wait until you feel thirsty, you may already be dehydrated. No one is sure where this advice came from, but it’s all over the internet.As we get older, our sense of thirst can get fuzzier and that is when dehydration can become a threat. It is a similar story for children, too. So perhaps the advice to drink water before you feel thirsty was originally aimed at parents and the elderly but now healthy adults are putting away gallons of water in a quest to be their best selves.There is a dearth of facts when it comes to hydration. Pharmaceutical companies aren’t interested in researching the benefits of a free resource and dehydration isn’t a pressing public health issue requiring government funding. This leaves a profitable grey area for the drinks industry to exploit. Water is, it would have us believe, a purifying fast-track to glowing skin, bright eyes and bags of energy. Galloway says detoxing with water is “a load of rubbish. Your kidneys do a very good job of sorting out what you need to retain and what you need to get rid of.”Will water make your skin better? While dehydration isn’t good for your skin, says Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist and honorary senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, “once you hit a certain level of fluid intake, providing you are healthy, any excess water will be peed out.”That is, unless you drink more than you can pee. Amanda Burls, an emeritus professor of public health at City, University of London, warns that drinking too much water can kill. Water intoxication occurs when the amount of electrolytes in the body becomes imbalanced by excessive water intake, disrupting brain function.Dehydration is said to be the most common cause of headaches and in 2015, Burls wrote a critical appraisal of the evidence. She concluded: “Chronic mild dehydration may trigger headaches. Increased water intake could help. A small trial shows modest benefit however, a larger, methodologically sound, randomised controlled trial is needed to confirm efficacy.” There is that grey area again.In the US, popular advice is to drink eight, 8-ounce glasses of water – about 2 litres – a day: the “8x8 rule”that originated from a recommendation by the nutritionist Dr Fredrick J Stare in 1974 (he actually suggested six to eight glasses).In the UK, the NHS recommends six to eight glasses, or up to 1.2 litres of “fluids” daily, pointing out that we obtain fluids from food. But it is the 8x8 rule that has become a health-goal meme with “the 8x8 challenge”.How much you need to drink is governed by how active you are, the weather and your physiology. Tellingly, if you seek water-consumption advice from a quietly reputable US source such as Harvard Medical School, instead of the 8x8 rule, you get “four to six cups” a day for healthy adults and all beverages count, even diuretics such as coffee, tea and booze. Don’t they make us pee more so we end up dehydrated?In 2016, Galloway tested the hydrating potential of a range of drinks and found a litre of beer was no less hydrating than a litre of water. Similarly, a litre of instant coffee, containing 212mg of caffeine, was as hydrating as water. Milk was even more hydrating, and effective as a hydration solution for people with diarrhoea. While not a green-light to binge on high-calorie drinks, it’s good to know that a cup of tea or half a lager still count as water intake.How many of us are seriously dehydrated? No one knows but Galloway once studied fluid intake among workers in a Cardiff call centre and found that, to keep their ratings up, many would restrict their fluid intake to avoid loo breaks. “We imagine similar behaviour with long-distance lorry drivers,” he says. If we’re ingesting enough water, he adds, we should probably be going to the loo “somewhere between five and seven times a day”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e31b408ff71bf6c9a2179d674e46f30078afc97/0_68_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=525d12543edf5d59fd35f9f8d94dd785","title":"brexit explained how it happened and what comes next","story":"Confused by the whole 1,300-day Brexit saga? This summary sets out how and why it happened, and what can be expected in 2020 and beyondby  Jon Henley in Paris,  Jennifer Rankin in Brussels, and  Lisa O\u0027CarrollWhere to start? There’s geography: Britain is an island, and has been since geologically Brexiting from the continent 8,000 years ago. And history: unlike most of western Europe, it has not spent the past few centuries as a battlefield. Its history, rather, is global and imperial.That, plus second world war heroics, has given it a profound sense of exceptionalism, reinforced by relative economic success and an overwhelmingly Eurosceptic popular press that adores dripping corrosive untruths about Brussels.All this eventually combined to create the impression that the EU was essentially an anti-British plot: something that was somehow done to us. Hardline Tory Euroscepticism emerged with Margaret Thatcher’s Bruges speech of 1988, hounded the party into opposition in the 1990s, and returned with a vengeance once Conservative rule was restored in 2010.Amid the bitter fallout of the financial crash, mounting public concern over immigration and a political threat from the right in the form of Nigel Farage’s anti-EU Ukip party led David Cameron to promise an in-out Brexit referendum if he won the 2015 election.Three years of exhausting stalemate set in, as parliament refused to muster a majority in favour of a withdrawal deal mired in uncertainty chiefly over the future status of Northern Ireland.In short, a meeting in a wedding venue in the Wirral on a cold day in October 2019.Boris Johnson and Irish premier Leo Varadkar broke the impasse with an agreement on what to do about the tricky land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.This frontier had become a 300-mile stumbling block for Theresa May, who was unable to broker an agreement on how to take Northern Ireland out of the EU without reinstating unworkable – and unpalatable – border checks.Johnson and Varadkar essentially agreed to shift the border checks to between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.The deal is not popular in Northern Ireland. But it is one that commands the support of the Conservative party and its 80-strong majority. So, after it was approved by MPs in December and is ratified in the European parliament and Westminster later this week, it will bring the final curtain down on 47 years of EU membership at 11pm on 31 January.“Yes, but”. At the stroke of 11pm on 31 January (midnight in Brussels), the UK ceases to be a member of the EU. The orce is sealed. The only way back is an application to rejoin.But many people may not notice the difference, as the UK enters an 11-month transition period to allow time to negotiate a new relationship. That means staying in the EU single market, its customs union and paying into its budget. British citizens can continue to live, work, study and retire to the EU, while EU27 nationals enjoy those reciprocal rights in the UK.A more significant moment could be 1 January 2021, the UK’s first day outside EU rules. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, that day could be delayed until 2022 or 2023, but Johnson has ruled out any extension of the transition period.Life will carry on as normal for iniduals with one key change – UK citizens, from 11pm, will no longer be EU citizens.British passport holders will continue to be able to travel and work in the EU because the country remains in the single market for the transition period up to 31 December and the freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital over borders applies until then.The main change is legal and institutional. The article 50 process is over and non-reversible. Friday is the point of no return to the EU.The UK will continue to follow EU rules, but have no say in making them. British ministers will play no part in the EU law-making process. The prime minister will cease attending EU summits to set the bloc’s priorities.The UK’s 73 MEPs will be sent home, with one of the parliament’s union jacks dispatched to the EU-funded House of History. The last UK commissioner, Julian King, has already said goodbye to Brussels. The EU will move on without Britain.Over 47 years, British governments cheered liberal economic policies (above all the single market), promoted EU enlargement, invented regional policy subsidies for poorer regions, pushed reform of fisheries and farming, watered down some environmental protection laws (and championed others), while avoiding the euro and the Schengen passport-free zone.The UK had “the best possible world”, concluded one veteran French diplomat. Now it’s gone.After almost half a century of membership, the departure from the EU is a historic event. But the prime minister has to be careful about not deepening the isions in the country by being too celebratory and has instead chosen a series of toned-down events to mark the occasion.Instead of Big Ben chiming out as the UK officially leaves at 11pm on Friday, a clock counting down be projected on to No 10 Downing Street.And an effort to convey the Tory party’s commitment to “levelling up” the country, a special cabinet meeting will be head in an as-yet-undisclosed location in the north of England.The union jack will fly from all flagpoles in Parliament Square but there will be no emblematic lowering of the EU flag.A commemorative Brexit 50p coin with the words “peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations” will come into circulation. New stamps marking the occasion are also in the pipeline.Farage and the Leave Means Leave campaign are hosting a party for the countdown in Parliament Square, with Brexiters encouraged to go in fancy dress.There is no official wake for remainers but  readers have shared their private plans to mark the momentous day.There is a set timetable for the year with negotiations expected to formally kick off after 25 February.By 1 July there must be a deal on fisheries and a UK decision on whether to ask for an extension to the transition period.Johnson has urged Brussels to fast-track trade talks, but the EU moves at its own pace. Draft negotiating mandates are due to be produced by 1 February and EU ministers are expected to approve a mandate for the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on 25 February, allowing formal talks to begin soon after.These talks will be unprecedented, and could cover a vast sweep of policies, including trade, security, foreign affairs, data, fisheries, cultural-educational ties and much more.However, with just 11 months to negotiate, the chances are there will only be a “bare bones” deal likely covering trade, fisheries and security. If that is the case, then, at the end of 2020, there will be a lot of unfinished business. Differing aspirations for the trade talks have raised the prospect of a new no-deal scenario at the end of this year.Leaving the transition period without a trade deal would not lead to the major diplomatic bust-up that failure on the Brexit withdrawal agreement would have done.It would have huge domestic consequences, however, with representatives of the car industry, hospitals, agriculture and directors already expressing alarm over Sajid Javid’s declaration that the UK will not follow EU rules, which will cause hold-ups in Dover and Calais and possibly lead to businesses quitting the country.In the absence of a deal, the earlier accord on citizens’ rights, money and the Irish border remains intact.The special arrangements that apply in Northern Ireland will kick in, deal or no deal.Both sides would brace themselves for the economic shock of trading on World Trade Organization terms, an outcome that is more damaging for the UK. But talks would roll on.Top of the list is a trade deal to ensure the tariff and quota-free flow of goods between the EU and UK. But the EU will only agree to zero tariffs and zero quotas if the UK pledges zero dumping – that is, not lowering social and environmental standards to outcompete the EU.Negotiators will almost certainly clash over the EU’s refusal to bring services into the trade deal, leaving the City of London reliant on a patchwork of market access agreements that can be withdrawn at any moment.Another early fight will be over fish, as the EU seeks to link goods trade to maintaining the status quo on access to British waters, a demand seen as outrageous in London.The non-trade topics sound easier, but are full of political landmines. For instance, agreeing a replacement for the European arrest warrant will require Germany to change its constitution. The UK will struggle to achieve the historic first of securing outside access to some EU crime-fighting databases.It depends who you ask. In the short term, much of the risk seems to have been priced in, at least on currency markets, where sterling still languishes compared to where it was in June 2016. The stock market is well ahead.A slightly more certain outlook could allow business investment to recover, after years of lagging behind Britain’s G7 peers. But against that must be weighed the unpredictability of the looming trade talks.The EU has always expressed regret at Britain’s decision to leave, repeating as long as legally possible throughout the Brexit process that the door was still open should the UK change its mind and, more recently, that it could always reapply after leaving.But the bloc has also robustly defended its interests, in particular the integrity of the single market, insisting, with unexpected unanimity, that Britain could not “have its cake and eat it” by retaining the benefits of EU membership while erging from its rules.Frustration mounted at what the EU27 saw as the UK’s reluctance to accept the real-world consequences of the vote to leave, its inability to agree on what kind of Brexit it wanted, and of course the long months of parliamentary psychodrama and paralysis that ensued.Some countries (France) have taken a much tougher line than others some (the Netherlands, Denmark) will suffer much more from a no-trade-deal Brexit. But the EU27 should maintain their unity during the future relationship talks: however much of a blow a hard Brexit may be, a weakened single market is a far more damaging prospect.No one yet fully knows much remains to be negotiated. The withdrawal agreement secures British citizens’ basic rights to live and work within their EU host countries, a broadly similar post-Brexit status in each country, and EU-wide coordination on reciprocal healthcare and social security.During the 11-month transition period, because the UK will remain in the single market, Britons will retain the freedom to move within the EU as before. After it ends they will have the right – providing they register, or in some countries apply, within a given time limit – to stay and, after a time, seek permanent residence.Some rights within the gift of the UK are not yet assured either, such as home fees for British students on the continent who wish to study in the UK, and family reunification rights for Britons returning to the UK with EU family members.Many British voters who were passionate about staying in the EU will be feeling upset and emotional at 11pm on 31 January. While life goes on as normal in general, it is the point of no return and from 1 February British citizens will no longer be EU citizens.But for EU nationals in the UK the moment will cast a long shadow of material consequence. While the government has given assurances that they will not face deportation or loss of social or employment rights, the bond of trust with the government is weak, not least because of the Windrush scandal.Although it will certainly affect the UK more than the EU in almost every respect, Brexit will undoubtedly weaken the EU economically and politically. Britain was the EU’s second-biggest economy, a major net budget contributor, key military force and one of the bloc’s two nuclear powers and permanent UN security council members.The EU’s institutions may have withstood the test of Brexit better than expected so far, and support for the EU among its citizens has generally increased. Brexit has also proved a salutary lesson, with almost all the bloc’s nationalist and Eurosceptic parties dropping promises to follow the UK’s example.But the UK’s departure has distracted attention from a number of other big and urgent problems, including the climate crisis, and settling on the new relationship is also likely to be a messy and debilitating process. Longer term, in the balance of global powers a smaller, fractured Europe is obviously a weaker Europe.In the face of an aggressive China and an increasingly protectionist and unpredictable US, the EU will need to be significantly tougher, with a centralised foreign policy and stronger rules ensuring European companies can compete with overseas rivals.

On the 75th anniversary of the concentration camp’s liberation, they tell their storiesOn 27 January 1945 Soviet soldiers entered the gates of the Auschwitz concentration camp in south-west Poland. The site had been evacuated by the Nazis just days earlier. Thus ended the largest mass murder in a single location in human history. Precise numbers are still debated, but according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1 million to 1.3 million Jews sent to the camp. Other victims included approximately 74,000 Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet PoWs and at least 10,000 from other nationalities. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp. Susan Pollack and Ivor Perl were children when they were transported to the camp, two of an ever decreasing number of survivors who are able to provide first-hand testimony of what happened to them. They speak to Anushka Asthana about their time at Auschwitz, and how they rebuilt their lives afterwards.  With thanks to Arthur Cary. His documentary The Last Survivors features Susan and Ivor.

But there is one crucial exception: the UK will fall out of all EU decision-making bodies – and the consequences will be immediate.On Friday evening, flags will be taken down, British access to EU diplomatic cables will be switched off, the UK will go beige on EU maps – the neutral colour of a foreign country.Everyone knew this day was coming, but it will still be a big moment. “It will be very sad,” Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s competition commissioner, said. “I think it will bring back the feeling of the day of the referendum. The sorrow, it was tangible, it was almost something you could hold.”Others are more matter-of-fact about Brexit day. “Does it make us happy? No. Does it make us sad? No. Because it’s what we have worked for,” said one EU diplomat referring to the tortuous negotiations over the “orce” agreement. “It’s a reality. It is a matter of fact. It is not a day to rejoice.”At the end of the week, three EU presidents will mark this fracture in EU history: Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European commission, Charles Michel, chair of EU leader summits, and David Sassoli, European parliament president, are expected to issue a joint statement.On the eve of Brexit day, the three leaders will gather in northern France for a “retreat” on the future of Europe at the house of Jean Monnet, the French statesman whose vision for peace through political integration helped create the European Coal and Steel Community, the precursor of the modern EU. Neither the timing, nor the venue seem accidental.Details are still being worked out, reflecting the sensitivity of the moment. No entire country has ever left the EU before, so there is no protocol on how it works. There will be “no big ceremony, just a low-key message” said one source.While Westminster will see a countdown clock projected on the walls of No 10, government buildings lit up and union jacks flying in Parliament Square, Brussels will be sombre.British flags in the EU institutions will be taken down by maintenance workers, out of office hours, with no cameras to record the moment. One of the European parliament’s flags will be sent to the House of History, the EU-funded museum in Brussels. At the EU council of ministers, the nerve-centre of EU law-making, the union jacks will be taken down and put in a cupboard, along with those of other non-EU states, “third countries” as the EU refers to the rest of the world.From midnight, British diplomats will be locked out of Brussels internal databases, denied access to the diplomatic cables from 139 EU delegations around the world, draft legislation and internal memos that are the heartbeat of European decision-making. The switch-off only affects EU internal communications, as the UK will continue to have access to EU crime-fighting databases under the terms of the transition period. EU diplomats have received warnings to check that no British official is accidentally left on a classified mailing list.The UK will be scrubbed a grey or beige colour on EU online maps, like Switzerland and Norway. Technicians are working to update hundreds of webpages to update references to the UK, from updating technical points on EU law, to the educational output aimed at teachers and children, such as online quizzes and the commission’s “Europe and you” activity book for children under nine.At the European parliament visitors’ centre, miniature models of British MEPs are to be removed from mock-ups of the parliamentary chamber.Artwork from the UK government art collection, currently on display at the European commission, such as Sonia Boyce’s screen print honouring black female singers, will remain on loan for the foreseeable future. The European parliament has no plans to rename its Winston Churchill building nor the Margaret Thatcher room.When British diplomats come to work on Monday 3 February, they will no longer be able to walk into EU buildings. Passes and keys must be returned. The British can apply for a limited number of diplomatic passes to the European parliament, but are unlikely to get routine access to other institutions.It will be a stark change for British diplomats, after decades of co-writing laws on the single market, wielding vetoes on taxation and driving forward EU foreign policy sanctions against rogue states. The British rooms in the council of ministers, where diplomats successfully strategised about reducing the EU budget during all-night talks fuelled by Haribo sweets and Nespresso coffee, will be left empty. But the British are not leaving Brussels. The UK government office in Brussels, currently known as UKRep, will be rebranded, as it searches for new forms of influence outside the meeting rooms. The European flag flying at the door will be removed, a symbol of that change.For some EU diplomats, Brexit day brings relief. One likened the last few years of twilight membership to a orced couple living in the same house, sleeping in separate bedrooms.“This has been awkward for both sides,” the diplomat said, citing a recent dispute over a road-tolls regulation, where the UK could have inadvertently blocked the law by abstaining (in the end the law failed for other reasons).For some 31 January is just another part of the British unwinding, as they look to turbulent negotiations ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adad671fe694a97dad91d8f7acd40962f6afc5c0/0_0_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fef74588c4286ffde7327e9757c732e7","title":"britons in eu urge barnier not to use them as bargaining chips","story":"Campaigners press negotiator to resolve their rights separately from trade talksBritish citizens in the EU have implored Brussels and London not to make them “a bargaining chip for the second time” in Brexit trade talks.They are deeply concerned that they are being “massively downgraded” and that they will be used by Brussels as leverage to exact concessions from the UK in the second phase of the negotiations.Campaigners have written to the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, arguing that their rights should be separated from trade talks and secured urgently.“Our remaining rights should not be deferred once again,” wrote Jane Golding, the co-chair of British in Europe, in a joint letter with Nicolas Hatton, the co-founder of the3million. “They should not be bargained against, made dependent on or packaged within other negotiation issues. We must not be made bargaining chips a second time.”They have launched an information campaign for worried Britons because of what they say is a lack of consistency among member states on their rights.Key among their concerns is the continued right to move and work across Europe. This was not resolved in the withdrawal agreement, which will be formally ratified this week, and was bumped into the second phase of negotiations because the UK wanted to end uncontrolled migration to Britain.British citizens in the EU feel they are “collateral damage” because the free movement talks have no consequence for EU citizens already in the UK as they have the birthright, as citizens of a member state, to continue to live or work wherever they like in the EU. British nationals in the EU, on the other hand, as citizens of a third country post-Brexit, will not have that right.It will limit their right to work across borders and remove their automatic right to return to the UK with an EU family member or to return to the UK for a period of time to look after an elderly or sick relative without compromising their residency in the EU.Golding said: “Free movement is indispensable, not a nice to have, for hundreds of thousands of working people who have rents or mortgages to pay and families to provide for. Without it, our lives are set for a massive downgrade.”Golding and other campaigners will travel to Brussels on Wednesday to meet Barnier’s taskforce to press their case.It is concerned that EU member states have not said what system they will use to record the right of British citizens to stay after the end of the transition period.No other state has launched a special system for them, equivalent to the UK’s settled status scheme. Nor has any member state bar Ireland outlined what Britons will have to do.If member states go down a similar road to the UK with a constitutive system, there are only 12 months to get it designed, launched, advertised and operational.“This leaves an extremely short timescale and much uncertainty about the terms of such a system. Many citizens may yet be rejected for the lack of sufficient income or failure to clear other eligibility hurdles,” the group said in the letter to Barnier.Britons in the EU argue that they moved to another member state in good faith under the rules of the EU and those who moved to the continent before the end of the transition period should retain those rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d75d25b7dd33c3bb223d46c39200fea4acc79c5/0_52_5178_3107/master/5178.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20a4d6a19bb889f2daee40ae0940319c","title":"what happens on brexit day and what comes next","story":"This Friday, 31 January, marks the start of a race to get a trade deal done by the end of the yearThere will be little official pageantry to mark Britain’s departure from the European Union at 11pm on Friday. A clock counting down the last hour will be projected on to No 10 Downing Street, and Nigel Farage will host a celebration in Parliament Square where flagpoles will fly union jacks.But there will be nothing like the torchlight procession that marked the august occasion on 1 January 1973 when the prime minister Edward Heath was joined in Brussels by his predecessors Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home and a chorus of leaders from across the political ide to witness the accession of the UK into the European Economic Community.Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration. Yes. Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty. It carries sanctions for any “backsliding or half measures”, as Michel Barnier’s adviser Stefaan de Rynck pointed out last week in London. We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.“The UK is five days away from entering into a highly complex and potentially extensive set of negotiations with the EU, and from entering into quite an elaborate joint institutional architecture with the EU to manage the withdrawal agreement. But we know little in detail about how either of these are going to work on the UK side, in terms of institutions and process,” says Brigid Fowler, a senior researcher with the Hansard Society.While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson’s specific goals.Johnson is doing everything he can to expunge the word Brexit from the British lexicon. He has already reduced parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase, and his government has given only clues as to what the goals and red lines in negotiations will be.Negotiating mandates setting out wishlists and red lines are usually published by both sides before they enter into trade talks. Until Sunday, when the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr that they would be published, it had not been clear that Johnson would do so at all.The prime minister is expected to give further clues in a keynote speech in the next fortnight, but parliament’s involvement in approving the negotiating mandate was removed from the Brexit bill.“Essentially, the government seems to be planning to rely on normal mechanisms for ministerial accountability to parliament. These put the government in control of what information is made public and when,” says Fowler.A reshuffle is expected in early February and some departments are expected to be axed. Barclay’s Brexit department will close on Friday and there could be changes to the function of the Treasury, the Department for International Trade, the Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, continues to head a special Exiting the EU operation committee, known as XO, and is expected to continue to have a key role in the next phase.HMRC will be one of the key cogs in the Brexit chain as work must start urgently on the complex arrangements for Northern Ireland that will affect all businesses trading on both sides of the Irish Sea. Expect an early clash between the EU and Johnson, who has repeatedly claimed there will be no checks on goods, in contradiction of the withdrawal agreement.New border systems will be needed for the rest of the UK, and the EU and HMRC will be frustrated in designing them until the shape of the deal is known, possibly not until the summer. HMRC is short of key personnel and recently advertised for a deputy director to take charge of EU exit, who “will be responsible for providing the strategic direction for the project, delivering all the operational, communications and business changes needed in readiness for the UK’s exit.”A former head of HMRC has said it could take five years to get the sort of IT system proposed for Northern Ireland up and running.Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada’s new deal with the EU.Under the withdrawal agreement, a joint committee of EU and UK representatives to oversee implementation of the treaty can sit from 1 February.While the powers of the committee are known, we know very little else. The appointments process, the size of the committee and how often it will meet has yet to be disclosed. One senior source said the committee would not be as influential as speculated.This remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said last week that the EU and the UK would have to be “very disciplined” if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson’s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory.Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for European affairs contradicted him directly on Sunday telling Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “There will be no checks on the island of Ireland, we’ve been very clear on this.”Underneath the joint committee will be a specialised committee and working advisory group to establish the Northern Ireland protocol.Northern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up the working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

Some 73 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK and all tests have come back negative, the Department of Health and Social Care said.In an interview at the King’s College London Mathematics School after launching a post-Brexit visa plan, Boris Johnson said: “We are looking at everything we can to give reassurance to those people in Wuhan and you will be hearing a bit more in due course but I don’t want to pre-empt the decisions we are going to make,” he replied.“Obviously, we are doing everything we can to ensure that people who do come to this country are properly screened and checked if they have come from an area that is known to have the infection. So far there is still no case of somebody with coronavirus here the UK but clearly there are a lot of cases in China and it is spreading.” The home secretary, Priti Patel, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, have said ministers are considering an evacuation plan, but both have stopped short of committing to one.By comparison, the French government has said its citizens who want to leave Wuhan, will be taken on a direct flight to France in the middle of this week, then held in quarantine for 14 days.Japan has chartered evacuation flights to take out 560 Japanese citizens who are confirmed in Hubei and the US consulate in Wuhan is arranging a charter flight on Tuesday to evacuate its personnel and some other Americans.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 27 January, the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than 2,700 cases and 56 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the 14 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan, and elsewhere, Hunt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think I would be very sympathetic and I’m sure the Foreign Office would be too.”He added: “This is a very difficult time of year for the NHS – it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies.”“The thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services,” he said.“It would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what is necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.”The World Health Organisation is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.UK in China, the official Twitter account of Britain’s embassy in Beijing, tweeted: “We are working to make available an option for British nationals to leave Hubei province.”Providing details of a 24-hour helpline British nationals could use if they required assistance, it added it was continuing to monitor developments closely and was in close touch with Chinese authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36753c76ff254957876dc56d600daec78dc09b19/0_115_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5616f0abdd5fb1ecdd945d1911b1adf","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms sars china wuhan","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how is it transmitted from one person to another, and how is it related to Sars?It is a novel coronavirus – that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

But atmosphere is something I am choosy about I want to go somewhere that has charm and character, somewhere that has life both on and off the piste. Just a 45-minute drive from Innsbruck, the Wildschönau and Alpbach valleys tick all of those boxes. Steeped in Tirolean culture, the mountains are dotted with pretty villages, handsome wooden farmhouses, onion dome churches and a great choice of family-run hotels and restaurants serving up hearty Austrian fare. And it’s good value too, making it an ideal choice for families and first-timers.SkiingThe Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau is one of the larger ski regions in the Tirol, with 68 miles of pistes. At its heart are two mountains, the Wiedersbergerhorn (2,128m) and the Schatzberg (1,903m), which are linked by cable car. Between them they can cater for most levels of skier, but families and novice skiers will particularly appreciate the wide, gentle nursery slopes around the villages of Inneralpbach and Niederau. Intermediate skiers can take their pick from a variety of attractive, meandering runs, such as the 2.5 mile tree-lined run that sweeps down from the Pöglbahn station towards Inneralpbach. Those in search of more challenging terrain will find some rewarding black runs and off-piste skiing above Niederau and at the top of the Wiedersbergerhorn. There are two snow parks where boarders and skiers can work on their tricks, and you can try night skiing at the Reither Kogel, whose slopes are floodlit every Friday and Saturday from Christmas until the beginning of March.Where to stayThe villages of the Wildschönau and Alpbachtal valleys offer a perfect antidote to bland purpose-built resorts. For chocolate-box Tirolean charm, few places can rival Alpbach, which has been voted Austria’s “prettiest village”. New for this ski season is Die Alpbacherin, a four-star boutique hotel with smart rooms, a spa, infinity pool and restaurant specialising in regional food. If you want to be right on the slopes, the hamlet of Inneralpbach, a little higher up the valley, is a good option, with a smattering of family-friendly hotels, a small microbrewery and direct access to the lifts. Niederau is perfect for first-time skiers, with a string of good-value family-run hotels, many of which are a short walk to the slopes. We enjoyed the warm hospitality and excellent home-cooked food of the Wastlhof hotel in Niederau, which has spotless rooms and a great indoor pool and spa. The hotel recently opened a new wing across the road with family-friendly apartments overlooking the ski slopes.Where to eat and après-skiIf downing shots and dancing into the small hours is your idea of après-ski heaven then you might want to look elsewhere. The scene here is lowkey: think cosy mountain huts serving locally-brewed beers and hearty meals brought to your table by lederhosen-clad waiters. This is dairy farming country so cheese and cream get star billing on menus. I still daydream about the brezensuppe (pretzel soup) I tasted in the Gasthaus Thalmühle in Oberau – a rich beef broth laced with pretzels and topped with melted cheese and fried onions. Another great place to try out regional specialities is the Böglalm hut in Alpbach. On sunny winter afternoons skiers queue for schnitzel and spazln (the Austrian answer to gnocchi) cooked up in huge pans on outdoor stoves. Wash it down, like the locals do, with a shot of krautinger schnapps, which is distilled from turnips and which only a handful of families in the Wildschönau valley are licensed to make.Things to doWhen you tire of hurtling down the slopes on skis or a board, you can hurtle down them on a toboggan – there are runs in Niederau and Auffach. Or you can buckle up for a ride on the Alpbachtaler Lauser-Sauser – an Alpine coaster that gives the thrill of high-speed sledging on rails. Learn how to drive a piste basher at Reith im Alpbachtal or to build an igloo in Niederau. The Alpbachtal Seenland card and the Wildschönau card offers lots of discounts and benefits, including unlimited travel on the ski bus, free guided snowshoe walks and free use of the cross-country ski trails.Find out more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2495cbc5b7003483bccc3a7508ed7491e9b64a56/656_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dfa60fe84483cb4453e11fd9e56feb9","title":"the alpine region that never sleeps after dark fun in austrias skiwelt wilder kaiser brixental area","story":"From night skiing to igloo sleepovers, this forward-thinking corner of Austria provides all manner of twilight adventures for nocturnal thrill-seekersThere is nothing like the feeling of still being out, high on the shoulder of an Alpine peak, when the pink-peach of the evening Alpenglow dwindles to grey, and the icy black of night takes hold, making smoke of your breath.In Tirol’s vast SkiWelt region, you could be up the mountain in the dark of night for many good reasons – for apres ski, of course, for adventure, doing a high-energy, adrenaline-fuelled activity, or something utterly romantic … By day, superb skiing, snowboarding and winter activities take place across Tirol’s SkiWelt Wilder Kaiser-Brixental region, a huge and varied resort comprising six linked ski areas and nine charming villages.But there’s stacks of thrilling after-hours action on offer too. Söll, perhaps the best-known of the resorts to Brits, is renowned for its night skiing, as Austria’s biggest night ski area, with five groomed pistes lit up with lights until 9.30pm, a floodlit snowpark and tobogganing day and night on special runs, plus a valley descent you can ski until 10.30pm. Ellmau, too, has night tobogganing.Every fun day on the mountain has to end with apres ski, and you’d need longer than a week to sip a spiced glühwein (mulled wine) or flügel (a popular Austrian ski drink of Red Bull, vodka and cranberry) in each village’s cosy mountain inns and slopeside hideaways. Among them are Soll’s Moonlight bar, with several levels, and Fabels in Ellmau, both with live DJs. From 7-29 March, there’s even more live music than usual for the Apres Ski Weeks festival, with folk music, jazz and rock in the mountain huts, and free ski guides on hand to lead revellers between them.The most romantic thing to do after dark has to be visiting the Alpeniglu village at Hochbrixen, where 18 igloos offer overnight stays, parties in an ice bar and an ice art and sculpture exhibition. The sudden cold that arrives at night can shock like a punch, but here guests are soon cosied up, wrapped in furs and sipping hot wine. Sundowners in the domed bar carved from ice are followed by a fondue at private ice dining tables, a snowshoe treasure hunt in the forest, or a nightcap by the campfire. Then you can snuggle into Arctic-grade sleeping bags on piles of reindeer furs where you remain toasty warm until the morning.Skiers of all levels are in for a treat here – it’s one of the biggest and most modern ski resorts in the world, with 90 cable cars and lifts accessing 176 miles of slopes across the linked ski areas of Brixen im Thale, Ellmau, Going, Hopfgarten, Itter, Kelchsau, Scheffau, Söll and Westendorf. Each resort has its own character and cool features: Westendorf has fun parks and a snowboarding scene Ellmau is known for its huge ersity of runs, remarkable viewpoints and fun parks Scheffau is great for learner pistes and easy cruising blues and Hopfgarten is the perfect place for astounding views, especially from the top of the Hohe Salve peak, home to a little pilgrimage church and where 70 peaks over 3,000m can be viewed from the top, including the Grossglockner, Austria’s highest mountain.If you’ve ever skied in one of those cranky old resorts, with lifts that break down all the time, poor piste maintenance, and shonky overpriced cafes … well, SkiWelt isn’t like that. This is a resort striving to be one of Austria’s best, constantly upgrading, and with a drive towards sustainability. Most of the resorts have snowparks, there are many long runs down to the valley, challenging steep pistes and backcountry for advanced skiers, including long scenic tours such as the SkiWelt tour, which has 21 valley runs, or perhaps your own ski safari across the whole area. But it’s perfect for first-timers and families too, with gentle beginners’ sections in each resort, and an easygoing vibe. Even the terrain has a friendly look, no scarily severe-looking peaks, just the beautiful iconic limestone outcrop that gives the SkiWelt region its identity, rising above everything.This season, a new eight-person chairlift, the Fleidingbahn, with heated seats and bubble cover, rolls into action in the SkiWelt Westendorf, up to the ski area’s highest point at 1,892 metres. In Hochbrixen, a new Zinsbergbahn lift will replace the old, combining eight-seater chairs and large gondolas, the first of its kind in the Kitzbühel Alps, which also generates photovoltaic electricity year-round. SkiWelt Brixen has a solar-powered system for snowmaking that only uses reservoir water from rainwater and snowmelt, there’s free charging for electric cars in several spots and the whole resort now relies on renewable energy. These efforts have won the region several awards. Those who want to minimise their own carbon footprint while visiting can reach SkiWelt by train from London St Pancras via Amsterdam, travelling overnight on the Alpen Express sleeper train to the gorgeous, characterful city of Kufstein nearby (worth visiting for a day in its own right, for its beautiful medieval old town, cobbled streets, towering fortress and Stollen, a cavernous, speakeasy gin bar that has the world’s largest gin gallery more than 1,000 varieties).Yet, aside from the investment in constant modernisation, this is a region soaked in the warmth of traditional Austrian hospitality. The historic mountain inns (of which there are 81) feel somehow polished yet cosy and rustic, and cater amazingly well for kids.The family-owned Kaiserhof Ellmau, for example, is right on the slopes, with a huge spa and wellness area, amazing views, kids’ club and an award-winning kitchen that’s won two prestigious Gault Millau torques for its creative twists on local classics.Others have play areas that would be paid-for attractions in their own right in the UK, with unique and witty touches that are pure magic for little ones.Across every aspect, this is an area that knows how to have fun.Find out more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c4af70b0829eac9de98c2b69a30f83db2900a17/0_36_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5443e5fa563db4c4978688d7dde62e6","title":"england south africa fourth test day four match report","story":"The dynamic Durham pace duo, who are never seen at Chester-le-Street, bowled England to victory on the hottest, steamiest day of the series. Ben Stokes and Mark Wood shared six wickets as England completed yet another emphatic Test win to seal the series 3-1. Here the margin was 191 runs – it was 189 runs in Cape Town, an innings and 53 runs in Port Elizabeth. The Test at Centurion now seems a century ago.The Durham monopoly extended to the end-of-series celebrations. Wood finished with nine wickets in the game and was given the man of the match award Stokes was the man of the series. He has long since given up any hope of anonymity. In this series, after a late arrival because of accepting the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award in Aberdeen, he has had to deal with his father’s ill health, a little fracas with a spectator here at the Wanderers on the first day, which grabbed the headlines in between delivering vital runs, wickets and catches, which he has done in abundance.It has been a harmonious series but for a moment or two tempers were frayed among the senior citizens on this final day, a consequence of the heat and a condensed, sapping schedule perhaps. In mid-afternoon Stuart Broad and Faf du Plessis exchanged pleasantries. Broad was no doubt unhappy that he and his colleagues had been in the blazing sunshine for over four hours with very little to show for it and a ball he disliked. Du Plessis was none too enamoured by a throw from Sam Curran at mid-on that seemed to have been aimed in his direction. Du Plessis and Buttler appeared to collide.It was a rare flashpoint, which should not trigger a draconian reaction after a series notable for healthy competition and mutual respect between the players. And perhaps this was an indicator that the South Africans were at last fighting with great resolution despite being in such a precarious situation. For a while battle was engaged on Monday with Rassie van der Dussen coming to the fore and within two runs of becoming South Africa’s first centurion of the series.Under a cloudless sky it soon became clear that England would have to sweat for longer to bowl South Africa out a second time. Broad and Curran shared the new ball but neither threatened much. The first hour passed peacefully drinks were much needed. Then as happened to Pope earlier in the match the drinks interval struck. Pieter Malan, whose concentration has been far more impressive than his range of strokeplay, drove loosely at the first ball from Chris Woakes after the resumption and Stokes took the catch at second slip.Van der Dussen’s progress was hastened by the introduction of Root’s off-spin and the batsman’s determination to be proactive. He reverse swept twice for boundaries and drove cleanly for six to the leg side during two overs of off-spin at the end of which it became apparent that Root’s last three overs in Test cricket had yielded (including byes) 54 runs.It was time for Stokes to restore order and he delivered once again. A bouncer surprised Elgar, whose attempted pull shot lobbed gently back to the bowler from the splice of the bat. So lunch was more palatable for the fielding side. Stokes and Wood, the most threatening bowlers, began after lunch and tested both batsmen. Du Plessis took 18 balls to open his account. After 50 overs, during which England had bowled well, just two wickets had been taken. Root tried Joe Denly’s wrist spin to no avail with Van der Dussen cashing in once more.Suddenly South Africa were 180 for two and England were feeling the heat. Now there was the little contretemps between Du Plessis and a gaggle of fielders. Wood responded with a short ball striking Van der Dussen a painful blow on the chest. Then Stokes rumbled in at Du Plessis and the ball kept low taking the bottom of the bat before striking the stumps.In the next over Root decided to adopt a bouncer field for Van der Dussen who was now on 98 there was no slip and several scouts out on the leg side as Wood ran in from around the wicket. The first delivery was duly dug in short but the next one was surprisingly full. Van der Dussen scented three figures and drove – in the air – to the solitary and soon to be jubilant fielder in front of square on the off-side, Broad, who remembered how to smile again. So tea tasted quite palatable as well.After the break there was a flurry of runs as the South Africans sensed that aggression was the only possible response, not that Quinton de Kock needs much encouragement to play his shots. Forty-eight runs came in six overs with Temba Bavuma picking up six quick boundaries. Then Broad produced something that really had him beaming. A short ball leapt up viciously at Bavuma who could only fend with his gloves. Another Broad bouncer (he had not really bowled one throughout the first three days) now prompted a hook which was top-edged by Dwaine Pretorius and well caught by Curran on the long leg boundary.There was no fairytale exit for Vernon Philander in his last appearance. He was caught down the leg-side off Wood, a common dismissal in this series and a consequence of the prevalence of pace bowlers and bouncy pitches. By now the game was well and truly up and De Kock, the best South African batsman in the four Tests by a disturbing margin, swung wildly at Wood. A crazy tailenders’ run-out, another leg-side catch by the ever-reliable Buttler – behind the stumps, that is – and the celebrations could commence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d8debfbedf3d395986b318eb1888ce961a4052e/0_136_3856_2314/master/3856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ba0304dc8843d11e150624f28a21ba1","title":"nick kyrgios shows resilience but cannot halt defeat to rafael nadal","story":"Irrepressible but outmatched, Nick Kyrgios departed the Australian Open with a fourth-round defeat at the hands of world No1 Rafael Nadal, who took the match 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) at the Rod Laver Arena. Containing some of the most thrilling tennis of the tournament, the three-and-a-half-hour tussle reached fever pitch in an electric third set, which Nadal won in a tiebreak, then chiselled his way to victory. Resilient in defeat, Kyrgios lost no fans.After a scrappy start, Nadal broke as early Kyrgios’s second service game, a drawn-out affair and a microcosm of the night, in which the Australian veered between his brilliant best and frustrating worst: twice he erred with drop shots when he had his opponent on the ropes. Quirky and captivating as ever, Kyrgios looked outdone for both power and precision in the early stages. Scything forehands that had flashed past his previous opponents’ rackets were now coming back with interest. His unpredictability, previously his trump card, now seemed to be confusing Kyrgios himself more than his opponent.There was also the curious case of the Australian’s approaches to the net, whose frequency are a tactical mystery at the best of times, because he’s not an especially gifted volleyer. Here they looked like suicide missions: five of them in the first set won him just a single point, and after 36 minutes Nadal had taken it.It usually pays to not read much into the preliminaries at blockbuster matchups like this, but a stadium announcer had the bright idea of asking the crowd who they were barracking for just before the players’ arrival. The question elicited a clear verdict: the roar for Nadal was twice as loud as that for the local. Perhaps it merely spoke of the triumph of commerce over patriotism: even via official channels, general admission tickets for this match were selling for 480 Australian dollars.But it said something else just as clearly: centre court is for winners. No longer could Kyrgios draw inspiration from his motley supporter base in the cheap seats across at Melbourne Arena. From the outset, Nadal’s supporters loudly reminded him of the events in Acapulco last February. Kyrgios actually won that battle, underarm serves and all, but Nadal claimed afterwards that he “lacks a little respect”, which on one hand is a little like saying the sky is blue, and on the other, a little beside the point of Kyrgios. The animus between the pair is longstanding and genuine.The second set tonight began inauspiciously for Kyrgios, who bungled his way into a marathon service game, quickly presenting Nadal with two break points. Already it felt like crunch time. The Australian saved them both, the second with a ’tweener that thrilled the crowd but could just as easily have lost him the point. “Say something!” he screamed at his player box soon after. What was really needed at this point was for Kyrgios to do something. Eventually he did, holding his serve, but it was a lot of hard yakka just to stay in the match.What followed went against both the early momentum and basic probability. Kyrgios reached desperately and floated a forehand winner down the line to break Nadal’s serve and lead 3-1. There followed two Kyrgios aces, and just past the hour mark, as he held serve with an emphatic love game, the momentum was tilting. Serving for the second set, Kyrgios sealed it with a pair of aces, wrapping it up in 46 minutes. Now he’d won every net point for the set, and walked to his chair with dead-eyed focus.At one set apiece, it was not unreasonable to expect that the match could rise in both intensity and quality, but the third set had the effect of making much else at this tournament seem pedestrian. Kyrgios chased like never before. Nadal unleashed his full armoury. Fans sat with their chins on steepled fingers, or gasped, or both. Facing a diabolical break point that would have seen him trailing 5-3, Kyrgios opted for his most outrageous drop shot of the night and succeeded, then emphatically held serve. Next up he did everything but break Nadal, but somehow it stayed on serve. Then Nadal did everything but break Kyrgios, but somehow we had a tiebreak.The tiebreak was manic. Down 3-1 in a flash, Kyrgios smashed his racket into pieces and threw it to a fan in the front row. The fan dropped it. The mistakes were contagious. Both players missed the sort of put-aways they’d nail 99 times out of 100. From 4-1 down Kyrgios drew level at 5-5. Then he double-faulted, and Nadal, on serve, had his chance to seal it. To howls of shock, he double-faulted too. But with a wild forehand, Kyrgios conceded the set in 72 of the most compelling minutes of the tournament. Nadal’s brilliance is so well honed at this point that his part in the show was entirely expected. That Kyrgios was so close to the mark meant he’d performed well above expectations.With that, Kyrgios’s chances seemed to have passed and you felt that Nadal’s ruthlessness would come to the fore in the fourth set. The Australian’s serve deserted him completely at one point and Nadal had the early break. Leading 4-2 in the deciding set, he even stopped to enquire after the health of a prostrate Kyrgios, like the guy who reaches for the restaurant bill after someone else has put their card down. But there was another twist in store. Serving for the match at 5-4, Nadal conspired to hand Kyrgios two break points and the Australian pounced. The battle was alive again, and destined for another tiebreak.Not for the first time, when faced with the dilemma of what approach to take, Kyrgios threw the kitchen sink at everything in his path. Some of his forehands were like windmill punches in a bar brawl. At 3-2 his method seemed to be working, but Nadal weathered the blows and forged ahead. A thumping body serve brought him two match points and only one was required. Barmy and brilliant until the end, Kyrgios had fired his final rounds. From here, Nadal will face Austria’s fifth seed Dominic Thiem in the quarter final, while Kyrgios departs with $300,000 and a decent launching pad for his season. Again, he bled from his endeavours.What was evident tonight, and what Kyrgios’s remaining detractors don’t understand, is that modern sport is not just about winning, losing and giant pay cheques. Sometimes it’s also not about noble concepts like sportsmanship or honouring the game. Its central place in the culture is reliant on precisely the kind of star power that Kyrgios and very few others bring to the tennis – what he brought here. Not just his skill, but his volatility, his incandescent glow, and his complete otherness among conventional, dependable winners like Nadal. Kyrgios is playing their game but he is not of it. The result is that he attracts the eyeballs of people who could take or leave tennis otherwise.“Against Nick, you are never under control,” Nadal said afterwards. But at 24, Kyrgios is yet to go close to claiming the grand slam trophy of which he is capable. In this Australian summer, displaying a patriotic fervour and no small amount of guts, he has at least won some of his home country’s coldest hearts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ab048d62ec35c148dd3965f1eb1b7db1712360/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc48966f0b57c388effb07e181e65bfe","title":"tell us about your favourite kobe bryant moment","story":"We would like to hear from you about the NBA great, who has died aged 41Kobe Bryant, the former LA Lakers star and one of the greatest basketball players of all time, has died in a helicopter crash in Los Angeles county.Over a career ning 20 seasons, Bryant won five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals.

But here is a question that may fox some of you: name a sports star who has been banned recently in Britain for doping? Go on, have a think. And no, Tyson Fury doesn’t count given his ended in 2017.Does London City Royals’ US-born basketball guard AJ Roberts, who received a two-year punishment for cannabis, ring a bell? Or Henry Hadfield, a League 2 North rugby union player who also got two years for a prohibited stimulant he insists was in a pre-workout drink? No? Me neither.That, I suspect, is why many athletes and anti-doping activists were so furious at reports last week that the Ukad chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, was apparently reluctant to hand over Mo Farah’s blood and urine samples to the World Anti-Doping Agency without “credible evidence” of banned substances. Their concern wasn’t just that Ukad is losing the war on doping, but that it wasn’t even fully engaged in the battle.Jessica Judd, who competed for Britain over 5,000m at the recent world athletics championships, was blunter than most. After admitting that she was “embarrassed” by Ukad’s stance, she then warned that athletics “is dying a drug-fuelled death”.Others flagged up the fact that Ukad refused to hand over Farah’s samples when the US Anti-Doping Agency began investigating the Nike Oregon Project in 2015, where the Briton was training at the time. And nor did it speak to the German journalist Hajo Seppelt when he claimed that an unnamed British athlete had taken EPO in Kenya. Ukad’s response – that it worked closely with Usada and conducted its own 14-month investigation into Seppelt’s claims – was met with scepticism.Ukad was even trolled by Russia, which warned that its stance was “creating a wall of mistrust in the country’s anti-doping system and, accordingly, its athletes”. You might raise an eyebrow. But imagine if the Russian Anti-Doping Agency withheld samples from athletes who worked with a banned coach. Wouldn’t Ukad be sceptical too?Yet all this negative publicity was easily avoidable. It all started 10 days ago when I asked Sapstead about Farah’s samples and the Wada investigation into the Nike Oregon Project. I expected a factual but formulaic response. Something like: “We haven’t been asked yet, but if they come knocking of course we would help.” Instead she performed the PR equivalent of bicycle kicking an innocuous cross into her own net.Only days later did Ukad release a statement saying that Wada hadn’t actually asked for the samples. It also might have made sense to point out that a new, more sophisticated drugs test, which is said to allow blood doping to be identified several months after banned performance-enhancing drugs such as EPO are used, is being developed. That is potentially very significant. As things stand, if someone microdoses EPO it can be undetectable to testers within hours.Sapstead’s comments came at the launch of a detailed and impressive Ukad report on the rise of steroids in British gyms. During her presentation she also highlighted Ukad’s education programme, which for some athletes starts as young as 10. No one doubts this is needed, but it is hardly a core function. Anti-doping chiefs should wake up desperate to stop cheats, eat their three square meals thinking of ways to catch cheats, and sleep uneasily if they fail. If not, they are not doing it right.Towards the end of Sapstead’s presentation I asked her how confident she was that all British Olympians heading to Tokyo could be trusted. “I am never going to pin my colours to the mast and say all athletes are clean,” she replied. “We have seen time and again that sophisticated cheats can beat the system. To prove that someone is clean you would literally have to be testing them every single day.”I don’t disagree. Sapstead did promise that Ukad would “move into the 21st century a bit more” by using more data profiling to catch cheats, but admitted that would take time, effort and money. How much is unclear.Ukad’s budget is £11m a year but its three investigators are stretched as it is. It also has far fewer powers than its equivalents in Austria, Italy and Germany, where it is a criminal offence not only to traffic and supply performance enhancing drugs but also to dope and elite athletes can be punished financially for sporting fraud. Increasingly I am persuaded that Britain should follow suit.“The constant discussion we have in the organisation is about this chicken and egg,” Sapstead admitted. “Do we not get the findings because we think we are doing a good job with education, and the athletes are generally clean? Or is it because the athletes are sophisticated, or we are not doing the testing in the right places?”The quiet tragedy is that a decade after Ukad was founded, we are still no nearer to knowing the answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8ea6f61f5632ba6d579944253d70d71b4713232/0_272_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c4aa122b9090776a3df549cd9ba35e","title":"kobe bryant a life in pictures","story":"A look back at one of the most storied careers in NBA history, following the death of the former LA Lakers basketball player in a helicopter crash"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29c884a33ea5ac6b1367620ba154979ae8896547/0_30_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b840821b18570ebd5f1b6ef3963097c8","title":"south africa v england fourth test day four live","story":"Ben Stokes and Mark Wood took the key wickets as England thrashed South Africa by 191 runs to secure a 3-1 series winWe’ll be back very soon – the ODI series starts a week tomorrow. Ta-ra. So there we are: England beat South Africa again, and in fine style. What an enjoyable series that was – intense, hard Test cricket with plenty of skill and momentum shifts. There is nothing like it. Here’s our report of the day’s play.Silverwood will talk to Moeen when he comes out about whether he’s available for Tests, and with Sri Lanka coming, there’s a chance for him. He’s very happy with his pool of bowlers, and says he can rotate if he needs to. They’re trying to make sure Wood doesn’t waste deliveries in the nets, because he’s so wholehearted all the time. He goes on to mention Jamie Overton and Ollie Stone, along with yer Andersons, yer Broads and yer Woakeses (of this world). Chris Silverwood is very pleased. He says that illness in Centurion pulled the side together, and he’s not surprised by how well they played subsequently. He’s happy that the team have made big first innings runs, and the bowlers are learning to take 20 wickets with the Kookaburra. He’a slo learnt about conditions - when the clouds come over pitches go flat, which affects who you bring on when. Wood says he’s had some “horrible days” where he doubted himself. Can he get back, does he want to get back, is he as good as he thinks he can be? He’s felt an England player since St Lucia but then had to come back again. Well done him it is impossible to overstate the joy in typing, reading and thinking about that. Stokes is encouraged by the development of the team, says Pope is at the start of a “very long international career”, and praises Sibley for facing down a quality attack. Stokes then says that the side is better with Wood in it and the dressing room will be noisier with him in it - and that his nervous energy explains the batting. Stokes comes over to say that the team were relentless, and they knew that South Africa were allowed to play well at times. Wood then laughs at Stokes’ “TV accent”, saying he’s not a “northern lad”, which was what Root called them. He says he was bowling cross-seam, trying to hit on a length but short rather than full. Root goes on to say that now the team have seen that the strategy works, they can deploy it with greater confidence. “It always felt like it was a bang bang sort of wicket,” Root tells Sky. Ward notes that all he has to do is throw the ball to Stokes and Root agrees Stokes wanted a day off tomorrow, and made sure he got one. He then notes that when the ball went soft, his team persevered and this is an example of what’s changed this series: the mental strength to persevere. The team were told very clearly what the strategy for the winter was: big runs, then moving the game forward with the ball. He says the fitness calls were taken out of players’ hands, and by batting first they gave Wood the best chance to succeed.He goes on to praise Crawley and Sibley, then goes back to Wood, who was sore but able to deliver his skill. Also, with five seamers, there was a chance to nurse the injury, and given the confidence he has, it was an easy decision. “Very special very special indeed,” says Joe Root. He’s especially happy with the reaction to losing the first Test, and very grateful to the support from the crowd. He says how pleased he is with how well his players have responded to opportunities they’ve been given through injury and such, and is excited by the blend of youth and experience in the changing room. He says South Africa is a great place to tour and that the cricket is always of a high standard – hmmm, not sure we can say that about the home side’s batting – and that’s pretty much that. I fancy he and his mates might need to take on board fluids round about now. It’s pretty emotional watching epochal talent fulfil itself, but make no mistake, this is it - we are privileged to be living in his time. He says the main thing is that England won the series and says he hopes his dad, sat in a hospital bed, will be proud. Team-man that he is, he then references his mates, especially the younger ones, and says how proud he is of them. He says he wasn’t sure if he was going to make it, but “boy am I glad I played now”. “I’ve had a lot of dark days,” he says, and thanks the medical staff, his team-mates and Chris Silverwood, who told him to go out there and have fun. “Give it everything I’ve got,” he says, when asked what his job in the team is. “Let if fly”. It’s beautiful to hear. Faf, who has very bald legs, says his team played well in the first Test but England were “better in every compartment” and gives credit to them for that. He namechecks Anrich Nortje and his skill in landing the ball in the same areas, at pace, before noting how hard it is to replace the “Dale Steyns and Morne Morkels” of this world. He also says that Van der Dussen was close to one of the great innings, and thanks Bigvern for his service and for being a “champion guy”. The team will sit in the dressing room and share the memories he’s bestowed and sacrifices he’s made. Bigvern is honoured with a presentation and says this isn’t the way he’d like to go out, but appreciates the response of both teams to his final Test. He says it was an honour to play for South Africa and wants to find young talent to mentor. “Vernon, you’ve been a treasure,” says Mike Haysman, and so say all of us. “Unless my maths is dodgy, in the space of three tests, Wood’s bowling average has fallen from just under 42 to just over 31!” says Kevin Wilson. It’s absolutely mad, is this: Athers, Nasser and Ian Ward are going through the England team bigging up nearly all of them. I don’t know where to put myself!Nasser rhapsodises Root’s improving captaincy, before reverting to the old cliche: Ben Stokes is the main man. He’s right, of course: at the key moments he made the key interventions, and it’s thrilling to consider that we’ve got at least four more years of him putting eejits in their places. Looking again at the England celebrations, it’s actually quite moving to see Mark Wood held aloft. To haul yourself back from injury as many times as he has requires a phenomenal amount of mental strength, and he must’ve thought that his chance of being a top Test-match bowler had gone. That’s hard enough for the likes of us to take, never mind for someone who actually has the talent to do it. His performance in St Lucia might’ve given him more joy because no one saw it coming, but to do what he’s done here must be more satisfying because he’s shown it was no fluke, that he can do it in consecutive Tests, and established himself as key man in a side who can feel something happening. On top of that, he’s very clearly an absolutely lovely man, who fully deserves everything he’s getting. Souh Africa have a lot of expertise on which they can call and which they’re now retaining – Smith, Kallis, Langerveldt. Whether they’re as good at organising as they are at playing, who knows – and they’ll need to be because the problems are structural. On the other hand, Markram has missed the whole series and they’ve found one in Van der Dussen, so it’s not all misery. But no attack can lose Steyn, Philander and Morkel and simply carry on winning Test matches. Nortje Nortje, very Nortje! Another short one, leg side again, and Nortje can’t get his hands out of the way. England have been absolutely brilliant these last three Tests and for the first time in a while look a serious proposition. South Africa have problems. 78th over: South Africa 274-9 (Nortje 4, Paterson 0) Wood goes short again and gets a wide for his trouble just what Nortje wants, another ball to face. And the next one seems to flick something ... England appeal ... no says the umpire ... and England review! Oh dear. Nortje knocks to mid on and Hendricks sets off without paying attention to the existence of the world around him. Sibley collects well, hurls to the striker’s end, and Buttler does the rest. 76th over: South Africa 268-8 (Nortje 2, Hendricks 1) Wood will be smelling another fifefer, and sets a field that suggests he’s going either short or full, with one slip and one leg slip. Hendricks gets off the mark with a pull behind square on the on side. De Kock’s batted beautifully here, but he takes one liberty too many, trying to shmice a full one down the ground. But he’s a little late on it, splicing high behind the bowler where Woakes takes easily.75th over: South Africa 265-7 (De Kock 39, Nortje 2) In commentary, KP reckons De Kock can’t go higher than five, while Athers suggest finding another keeper I’m not sure. Why would they want to, if he’s batting well doing both? 74th over: South Africa 265-7 (De Kock 38, Nortje 1) Wood bangs one into to Nortje and he edges, but it drops short, in front of square on the off side. This brings De Kock onto strike – he’s batted beautifully today, again – and when Wood bangs in again from around, he simply watches it onto his bat that he positions at the diagonal, but with the toe at ten o’clock as he looks at it, feathering four through backward point. He has some of the greatest eyes I’ve ever seen - looks do not deceive us. “If you plot ‘batting average to two decimal places’ against ‘Number of innings played’,” says James Debens, “the pattern is so unreadable that you might as well just draw a chain of Dickie Bird heads on sticks. And if you do that, an interesting thing happens: the Dickie Bird heads flash, and the phrase “Let’s have a cuppa tea instead” forms above the head of the second Dickie Bird portrait in a cottonwool speech bubble. I believe this is the correct conclusion to be drawn.”And that’s that on that. And I don’t even drink tea. What a player Vernon Philander has been, an absolute mainstay of one the greatest, toughest sides we’ve loved in recent times. De Kock hugs him and as he emerges from the tunnel his team-mates form a guard of honour. Oh, and he gloved a leg-side bouncer behind. 73rd over: South Africa 260-6 (De Kock 34, Philander 10) Let’s talk about Big Vern. I remember when he first toured England thinking that his stats might not survive! Shaaaame on me. You have to be so skilful to be so successful bowling his pace. Anyway, Root continues and Vern adds one then De Kock clouts six over cow. 72nd over: South Africa 253-6 (De Kock 28, Philander 9) Wood replaces Broad – I’m surprised they managed to prise the ball out of his death grip. Perhaps he’s just changing ends, but he was doing quite nicely previous. Anyway, Philander pounces on one that’s short and wide, humping four through cover, then picks up a short one and monsters it through midwicket for four more. A single then brings De Kock onto strike and when Wood goes around the wicket, he picks him up from outside off and deposits him over mid on. He strikes me as one of those who’s good at everything. Incidentally, there look to be a lot of insects out there. 71st over: South Africa 240-6 (De Kock 24, Philander 0) Root fancies finishing this so brings himself on. De Kock plays ot a maiden. “Thoroughly enjoyed ‘WICKET! Bavuma c Buttler b Broad 27 (South Africa 235-5)’’ says Kim Thonger. “I wonder when the next most recent alliterative dismissal was?”70th over: South Africa 240-6 (De Kock 24, Philander 0) Out comes Big Vern for his final Test go-around. De Kock takes another single, and he sees away the final delivery of the over. Have England ever had a better fourth-innings bowler than Stuart Broad? He goes short again and Pretorious hooks higher than the sun. But Broad has lived, he has tasted, fantastical places, his soul an oasis, and Curran takes the catch, running in and ing forward.

Here’s how to have a great time, while minimising your carbon footprintJanuary is always a struggle – cold, dark, full of broken resolutions and battered bank balances – but the beginning of 2020 has been particularly grim. From the crisis in Iran, bushfires in Australia, coronavirus and Brexit around the corner, the year could hardly have got off to a worse start. There is hope – of course – and there are holidays, too: this is peak booking time for the travel sector.Whether you already have a destination in mind, or are looking for ideas, your first port of call should be the Man in Seat 61 – an independent website covering every stage of booking trains in the UK, Europe and beyond. It includes everything you need to know about routes, fares, buying tickets, timetables and rail passes. The site was founded by Mark Smith in 2001, when cheap flights were booming and the typical seat61 user was, in his words, “afraid of flying, medically restricted from flying or particularly liked train travel”. Undeterred, Smith continued to share his tips – free – and this modest former station manager has become a guru among regular rail travellers.Not always. Door-to-door, it is quicker or as quick by train from London to Paris, Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam or Rotterdam (all direct routes on Eurostar). The Netherlands’ second largest city is tipped in  Travel’s 2020 hotlist for its architecture and progressive urban living (it’s home to the world’s first floating farm, and many hotels, restaurants and attractions support the city’s goal to be a waste-free society) – plus it’s less crowded than Amsterdam. Beyond that, yes, travelling by train takes longer – but that’s part of the appeal. This year, more of us will embrace rail travel, not just for environmental reasons, but because it’s fun. Not convinced? Pick up a copy of the latest edition of Europe By Rail, an anthology of 52 routes, from the north of Norway to southern Sicily.Instead of flying direct to Spain, the slow route might include overnight stays in Cahors (Gallo-Roman ruins and excellent red wine) and Foix (“one of those unsung but perfect-looking French towns”) before crossing the Pyrenees and passing through the Catalan countryside to Barcelona. From there, the rest of Spain awaits. At Easter, Renfe, the Spanish rail company, is introducing a new range of low-cost, high-speed trains, aimed at getting Spanish travellers off the roads, but opening up opportunities for tourists, too. Among the routes will be Barcelona to Madrid for €10.After being threatened with extinction, Europe’s night-train network is undergoing a renaissance. The driving force behind this is the Austrian state railway, ÖBB, which is expanding its Nightjet network across Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Italy into Belgium and the Netherlands. This month saw the return of a Brussels-Vienna sleeper. Departing the Belgium capital at 6pm, you will be rocked to sleep and arrive in the Austrian capital the next day at 8.30am – perfect timing for a coffee in the opulent setting of Cafe Goldegg, a five minute walk from the station. At the end of the year, ÖBB will add a route going from Amsterdam to Vienna.Unlike flights, the price of Interrail passes is fixed and children under the age of 11 go free, making it a better-value option than flying for families travelling in the peak summer months. Add in reductions for travellers under 27 and over 60, free luggage, regular deals and discounts on city attractions and Interrail looks increasingly like a modern miracle.As we leave the EU, plan your own ode to Europe – along the French and Italian rivieras, perhaps, before heading north into Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland, before returing via Berlin and Brussels. For itinerary ideas, go to thetravelinterrailing. And remember, for some trains you have to pay an additional booking fee.If poring over endless rail timetables is not your idea of fun, fear not – a growing number of tour operators are incorporating rail travel into their packages. For 2020, Sunvil has introduced Greece by rail for the first time – offering train journeys to the islands of Corfu, Paxos or Lefkas, and Parga and Sivota on the mainland, via the French Alps, Milan and Bari, from where the ferry departs. Just Sardinia and Just Corsica are also making it easier to reach islands without flying, building train and ferry crossings into their trips. Inn Travel, the walking and cycling specialist, has made all of its European mainland holidays, plus the Balearics and Sicily, available by rail, and trebled the size of its in-house rail team to cope with demand.Ferries could hardly be called green, but emissions for each passenger are considerably less than short-haul flights and the sector is endeavouring to reduce them. This year, Brittany Ferries is launching the Honfleur, its first liquified-natural-gas-powered ship, to run on the Portsmouth to Caen route, followed by the Salamanca in 2022 and the Santoña in 2023 on the Portsmouth-Bilbao service. South of Caen, connect to the Véloscénic cycle route that runs between Paris and Mont Saint-Michel, cutting across Normandy, stages of which are easy enough to do with kids.Stena Line is also investing in new technology and ships. Its rail-and-sail service to Amsterdam is an alternative to Eurostar – and a good option for families. Go to little-clogs-holidays for holiday park suggestions. The Dutch invented Center Parcs, but holiday parks are often cheaper there than in the UK.This month, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) issued a statement reassuring travellers that holidays won’t be affected by Brexit in 2020. Valid passports can still be used as normal, the cost of making calls, using the internet and sending texts will remain the same, and coaches and trains from the UK to the continent will be unaffected. Too adventurous? Switch off in comfort at the isolated Instants d’Absolu Ecolodge, a former farmhouse in the Auvergne, France, with a spa, delicious farm-to-table food and limited wifi and phone signal (Neussargues station is 10km away from £122 a night through i-escape). Or keep it simple – with a book by the (small) pool, wine in hand and views of the Umbrian hills at Wild Umbria, a holiday home for four (book through sawdays).Cycling specialist BSpoke Tours has a new coastal tour along the wild coast of northern Spain’s Asturias region (from £1,095pp, excluding travel take Brittany Ferries from Portsmouth to Santander). For sporty families, Adventure Creators puts together multi-activity trips in the French Pyrenees with rock climbing, high ropes and river rafting – ensuring kids will be so exhausted they may even forget about screens.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

She was earning $4.35 an hour carrying heavy trays and walking several miles a day – pumping breastmilk in the restaurant toilet when she could, and living in fear of her C-section scar reopening.“The biggest thing was that I was kind of scared. When you have major surgery like that and then you’re pushing your body so harshly,” said the mother of three from Bondurant, Iowa, who is remarkably phlegmatic about the experience.When she got home, Rebeschini would take over childcare duties from her husband Ron, 33, an optician, so he could go to work.“I remember every time I had to work I was like ‘please don’t reopen,’” she says of the scar on her abdomen. “I mean I was essentially risking my life.”Rebeschini’s experience is far from rare for America’s mothers. One in four women in the US return to work within two weeks of childbirth, according to the advocacy group Paid Leave US (PL+US).The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends women take at least six weeks off work following childbirth. But with no federally mandated paid family leave, for many women maternity leave is an unaffordable luxury.“If you look at paid leave rates between white families and families of colour, it’s even worse,” said Myra Jones-Taylor, chief policy officer at child development non-profit Zero to Three. “Parents just can’t afford to stay home with their babies.”Rebeschini, who left her previous job around a month before the birth, said financially she had no option but to work.Working shifts of up to 12 hours, she found the separation from her newborn agonising.“I would come home and the first thing I did was make sure that he was breathing … When you’re not physically there you just have to trust that he’s fine. You worry about the bond of being gone for so long … is he going to recognise you?” she said.She said she didn’t dare tell her new employer how recently she had given birth for fear of being considered a liability. While her manager was supportive of her pumping breastmilk, there was nowhere suitable to do it. “So I had to take my breast pump into the bathroom and hope that no one came in and saw me pumping.”Karter is now four years old, but Rebeschini worries about the potential impact of her early absence.Today she still experiences pain in her abdomen which she attributes to returning to work so soon.Rebeschini has since had a third child, Brody, who is now one. This time, she took two months off, but with no maternity pay it resulted in the couple falling behind on bills and having to declare bankruptcy – delaying their plan to buy a home.“You can prepare all you want to be off for a certain time and not have pay but it just doesn’t work. If we had paid leave, we wouldn’t have fallen so far behind that we couldn’t get ourselves out of a hole. We wouldn’t have that stain on our credit.”Dr Rebecca Jackson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, said breastfeeding is one of the biggest challenges for women who return to work early – especially low-wage workers.“If you’re driving a bus, how do you stop that bus to pump milk?”After a C-section, she recommends women take eight weeks off and to avoid heavy activity to prevent complications. “A lot of women still have significant pain at two weeks after,” she said.Kirstin Moody, 36, a waitress from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, could only afford to take one week off after giving birth to her son Alex, now 13, by emergency C-section. The waitress ended up ripping her incision six times and as a result can no longer feel her lower stomach.“I would feel like I was on fire, like somebody would take a hot poker and just drag it across the bottom of my stomach,” Moody said. “I was on pain medication for some of the time but it generally doesn’t help because you don’t get to fully rest your body.”As a single mother, Moody depended on the help of family for childcare while she worked nights. Parting with her newborn son was intolerable.“Oh God it was horrible. I cried and cried and I would sit at work and I would cry.”Paid family leave has gained broad support and looks set to become a policy point in the 2020 presidential election, though there are still disagreements in Washington on how to pay for it.In December the White House held a summit dedicated to the subject and recently passed a law to give 2.1 million federal workers 12 weeks of paid parental leave. So far, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed their own family leave bills.But despite all the momentum, millions of women are still having to return to work after childbirth long before they are ready.“On the politician front at least there’s progress,” said Jones-Taylor. “But any time we have a mother who is going back to work bleeding that’s not good for mum, it’s not good for babies, and it’s really just not good for the workforce.”According to National Partnership for Women \u0026amp Families, the benefits of paid family leave in states that have introduced it include improved worker morale, time for parents to bond with their children, increased breastfeeding, more children getting vaccinations on time, cuts in children’s hospital admissions and reduced probabilities of having ADHD and hearing problems.Although some private companies are starting to catch up by offering paid family leave as a benefit, many women get around the inflexibility of the corporate world by starting their own businesses. But with no paid maternity leave, there is still pressure to go back to work.Jessica Mann, 35, owner of Chicago-based beauty company Ari Rose Body Care, was back at work five days after giving birth to her one-year-old daughter Lila.Her partner Bryant Ousley, 33, was working long hours in a new job and did not qualify for any parental leave, so Mann was also doing the majority of the care for their three children.“Being a small business owner I felt that there was no other way that things were going to continue going without me and so it was more of a necessity than anything,” she said. “And then of course it impacts your income. So we have a new baby and we have three kids, to not work and not have that income would also impact our household.”Virginia delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy was back on the campaign trail knocking doors two weeks after giving birth by C-section to her now two-year-old twin sons Alex and Xander, who were born premature and spent four months in neonatal intensive care.“I had tremendous back pain, shoulder pain, and you have to think that you’re just coming out of major surgery where you are literally being sliced open and giving life to human beings, it takes a lot out of your body. But I was in a position where there was no time to rest, I didn’t have an option to relax.”Caroll Foy, 38, who was then still working as a public defender, was on disability benefits – which in some states can be used for pregnancy – so she was entitled to a portion of her income. But with she and her husband Jeffrey Foy, 38, a supervisor at a non-profit, taking cuts to their paycheque, their finances came under strain.It was such a wake-up call that she has introduced a paid family leave bill in Virginia. “When you’re bringing a new child into this world and you’re expanding your family, your income shrinks … I want to make sure that other women and families don’t have to make the same painful decisions about being with their newborn baby or paying for their bills and keeping a roof over their head.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02c8b7d2060b805e20381c3ba38c287d4d23ddfd/0_432_6483_3890/master/6483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43a3e6c30a75075517497243cd35e7a4","title":"auschwitz watch the ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the camps liberation","story":"Polish president among the speakers as survivors gather at former Nazi campWorld leaders and Holocaust survivors have gathered at the site of the former Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz to mark the 75th anniversary of the camp’s liberation.Two hundred survivors of the Holocaust were expected to attend, with visitors drawn from Israel, the US, Australia, Peru, Russia, Slovenia and elsewhere. As well as survivors of the camps, many bereaved relatives of those killed during the genocide were also attending.The Auschwitz concentration camp complex in south-west Poland was the site of the largest mass murder in a single location in human history. While precise numbers are still debated, according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1-1.3 million Jews deported to the camp. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp.When the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945, Soviet troops found grisly evidence of the horror. About 7,000 starving prisoners were found alive, and millions of items of clothing that once belonged to men, women and children were discovered along with 6,350kg of human hair.\u0026nbspIn January 1942, the Nazi party had decided to roll out the “Final Solution”. Camps dedicated solely to the extermination of Jews had been created before, but this was formalised by SS Lieut-Gen Reinhard Heydrich in a speech at the Wannsee conference. The extermination camp Auschwitz II was opened in the same year.Auschwitz II had the largest prisoner population of any of the three main camps on the site. In January 1942, the first chamber using lethal Zyklon B gas was built. Four further chambers were built, and these were used for systematic genocide up until November 1944.Auschwitz was also the site of disturbing medical experimentation on Jewish and Roma prisoners, including practices such as castration and sterilisation. SS captain Dr Josef Mengele was one of the physicians practising there.More than 7,000 Nazi personnel are thought to have served at Auschwitz but only a few hundred have been prosecuted for the crimes committed there. The pursuit of justice has not ceased, with German justice officials saying in 2013 that there were 30 surviving Auschwitz officials who should face prosecution. In 2019, a former guard at Stutthof concentration camp was placed on trial.\u0026nbspAmong politicians attending Monday’s observances at Auschwitz, which is located in southern Poland, a region under German occupation during the war, were Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, was also in attendance alongside the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier.Duda took the opportunity in his speech to recall how Poland was invaded and occupied, losing 6 million of its citizens in the war, half of them Jews. He stated that Poland fought the Germans on several fronts, warned the world in vain about the genocide of the Jews, and has for decades been a responsible custodian of Auschwitz and other sites of German war atrocities.The Polish president went on to say that distorting the history of the second world war, denying the crimes of genocide and negating the Holocaust was tantamount to desecration of the memory of the victims. “Truth about the Holocaust must not die,” he insisted.The ceremony took place in a heated tent straddling the train tracks that had once transported people to their deaths.Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, was among attendees at the memorial, visiting the camp with the museum’s director, Piotr Cywiński. He viewed a plaque that includes the name of London after it recently pledged a contribution of £300,000 ($391,000) for the site’s preservation.The camp was liberated by Soviet soldiers on 27 January 1945. They found 7,000 starving prisoners alive at the camp, where the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 Jews. Other victims included approximately 74,000 Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war and at least 10,000 from other nationalities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14464adf502fd32eb3c37b345aa86c52b852b023/131_414_3687_2212/master/3687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdea0da7287475a7614463928b6090f8","title":"football whistleblower rui pinto behind isabel dos santos leaks luanda leaks","story":"Football Leaks founder passed on financial records of Africa’s richest woman, says lawyerA Portuguese man behind one of the biggest exposés in the history of football has been identified as the source of a leaked cache of financial records about the business empire of Africa’s richest woman, Isabel dos Santos.Lawyers for Rui Pinto, who is awaiting trial in Portugal on charges including alleged hacking and attempted extortion, said in 2018 he passed a non-profit whistleblowing organisation a hard drive containing data relating to Dos Santos’s business empire, which is estimated at $2.2bn.Pinto is the founder of Football Leaks, which revealed confidential information about some of the world’s leading teams, which resulted in inquiries by tax authorities into several top players.He was not previously known to be the source of the Luanda Leaks, a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Dos Santos, whose father ruled Angola for 38 years before stepping down as president in September 2017.The Luanda Leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the , the BBC and the Portuguese newspaper\u0026nbspExpresso., the BBC and the New York Times were among 37 media outlets that earlier this month reported on the contents of the leaked documents, revealing the complex financial schemes that helped Dos Santos amass vast a fortune at the expense of the Angolan state. Dos Santos denies she became a billionaire through nepotism or corruption.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).On Monday, PPLAAF identified the founder of Football Leaks as its source, saying in a statement: “The source of the Luanda Leaks is the whistleblower Rui Pinto.”“PPLAAF is pleased that once again a whistleblower is revealing to the world actions that go against international public interest,” said William Bourdon, the president of PPLAAF and also a lawyer for Pinto.Bourdon, a French human rights lawyer who has also acted for Edward Snowden, added: “Like in the case of the Football Leaks, these revelations should allow for new investigations to be launched and thus help in the fight against impunity for financial crimes in Angola and in the world.”The ICIJ’s director, Gerard Ryle, said: “The leaking of this material to PPLAAF, and in turn to ICIJ’s media partners, provided indisputable evidence of unnecessary misery that was inflicted on the ordinary people of Angola, and the role of enablers who got rich by helping. The documents came from a concerned citizen – someone doing the right thing by the public.”Since the publication last week of the Luanda Leaks, Dos Santos has been named as a criminal suspect in Angola, where prosecutors are investigating alleged embezzlement and mismanagement of funds during her leadership of the state oil giant Sonangol.Dos Santos denies accusations of nepotism and corruption. She has previously denounced Angolan criminal inquiries and media reports about her financial affairs as part of a politically motivated “witch-hunt” by the new Angolan president.“The allegations … are extremely misleading and untrue,” she said in her most recent statement. “This is a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack, ahead of elections in Angola next year.”In its statement identifying Pinto as the source of the Luanda Leaks, PPLAAF said “the disclosure of the documents to PPLAAF was not politically motivated”.The Football Leaks website, launched in 2015, said its mission was to “show the hidden side of football”. The information it obtained and eventually shared with journalists around Europe raised concerns about the financial practices of some of the world’s biggest football clubs.Pinto, who was operating from Budapest, was detained in Hungary in January 2019 and extradited to Portugal in March. Earlier this month, a Portuguese judge ruled he would stand trial.Pinto faces 25 years in prison if found guilty of all 90 charges against him, his lawyer said. The charges include attempted extortion and hacking into the secret information at a number of organisations. He denies all wrongdoing and has never accepted the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65c781edc2944d7d84203603be89b1ab4854495f/0_203_4326_2597/master/4326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bc75812b4548b90c45eea6b5336ba17","title":"iran passenger jet skids on to highway after running out of runway mahshahr","story":"Pilot unable to deploy landing gear on touchdown at Mahshahr airport, media reportA passenger plane skidded on to a highway after landing at an airport in south-west Iran, state media have reported.“It ran out of runway when landing at Mahshahr airport with no casualties,” the IRNA said.Other Iranian media outlets reported that 135 passengers and seven crew members were onboard the Caspian Airlines plane but there was no official confirmation.The IRNA, quoting local aviation officials, said a technical issue delayed the plane’s landing, leading to the overrun at Mahshahr in Khuzestan province on Monday.Iranian media reported that the pilot was unable to deploy the landing gear, adding that the incident was being investigated.Photographs of the aircraft show registration number EP-CPZ, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 built in 1994.“The plane did not catch fire and all passengers safely left the plane,” Mohammad Reza Rezaei, the managing director of Khuzestan airports, told the IRNA.An unverified video shared on social media showed an evacuation of passengers from the plane in the middle of a highway.On Saturday, an Iranian airplane en route from Tehran to Istanbul made an emergency landing at a Tehran airport because of a technical problem, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.Iran’s airlines have been plagued by crashes, which the country’s rulers blame on US sanctions that block the airlines from replacing their ageing fleets or purchasing spare parts from the west."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Kerry County Council criticised over incident after same plot apparently sold twice in errorFr Paul Dempsey called in the past for a \u0026lsquonational gathering\u0026rsquo on the Church\u0026rsquos futurePatrick Mullally died after intervening in \u0026lsquodomestic\u0026rsquo row involving a martial arts instructorHiqa found understaffing at Lystoll Lodge in Kerry created risks for those living in facilityExpert group raises concern around Tusla\u0026rsquos powers to investigate abuse allegationsCourt heard Ben O\u0026rsquoReilly (21) punched the victim and placed his hands around her neckAaron Brady has pleased not guilty to the murder at Lordship Credit Union in 2013Conor (9) and Darragh McGinley (7) found dead with their sister Carla (3) in Dublin on Friday\u0026lsquoA kindly and attentive neighbour, a man of many talents who wasted none of them\u0026rsquoFirst conviction for \u0026lsquoheinous and barbaric\u0026rsquo practice recorded in history of the StateGarda (36) was shot dead after responding to domestic violence complaintSome Dublin stores have run out of stocks as public alarmed over China situationTaoiseach \u0026lsquosaddened\u0026rsquo at Britain\u0026rsquos departure but \u0026lsquoup for\u0026rsquo the next phase of trade talksGed Nash says fewer working days would make employees more productiveGrowing nervousness in Fine Gael as party trails Fianna F\u0026aacuteil in opinion pollsTaoiseach says UK politicians were \u0026lsquovery badly exposed\u0026rsquo when it came to Irish affairsScheme to replace wards of court system delayed again due to lack of fundingMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues yellow snow and ice warning for seven counties"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4152671.1580133595!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar blames british ignorance of ireland for brexit impasse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar meets  European Commission Chief Negotiator on Brexit Michel Barnier at Government Buildings in Dublin on Monday. Photograph: Tom Honan.British ignorance about Ireland was “very badly exposed” during the Brexit negotiations, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Mr Varadkar told the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg that Irish people understand a lot about Britain, but the opposite is not the case.He criticised the political classes in Britain for their ignorance of Ireland though Britain has a “very colonial history”.He added: “And that’s one thing that we actually find hard to understand because, you know if you grow up in Ireland, you know, we speak English as our first language, most of us do anyway. We watch the BBC, you know, we watch Graham Norton, we watch your television, your news.“We really understand a lot about Britain, but I think a lot of British people don’t understand a lot about Ireland, including your politicians ... and politicians in Westminster had to learn more about Ireland.“And I think as they learned they started to understand these issues, how sensitive the political situation is in Northern Ireland, and how we could never countenance a return to a hard border and how that was more important to us than economic issues.”He suggested the British believed France and Germany would side with them in the Brexit negotiation because of the volume of trade\u0026nbspbetween the countries.Underestimated“And the fact, I think, that a lot of people in Britain underestimated the fact that European partners will stay by us,” he said.“There were people in Britain who thought France, Germany and Britain would get together at a big summit and tell the smaller countries what’s what. That is not how the 21st century works. It is certainly not how the European Union works.”British prime minister Boris Johnson has set the end of this year as the deadline for agreeing a trade deal between the EU and the UK, declaring that there was “bags of times” to get it right.Mr Varadkar warned that any failure to get a trade deal by the end of this year posed an “existential threat if anything to our economy in 2021 so we want that deal”.He suggested that it will not be so easy to get a deal because the EU is suspicious that the UK is trying to “undercut us in terms of environmental standards, labour standards, product standards, food standards, all of those things.“When I meet prime minister Johnson he says, ‘no absolutely not that’s not the kind of United Kingdom that I want as prime minister’.“But we want that written down in law, we want that in a treaty so that we know that the UK will not be undercutting the EU with lower standards.”He suggested to that the trade deal will have to be agreed by each of the EU’s 27 parliaments. “And that’s where it gets messy. That’s where one country can hold things up, or two countries can, and potentially that might be the reason as to why we may need an extension for another year in order to allow parliaments around Europe, maybe where there are elections happening, who knows, to have a bit more time to consider it.”Mr Varadkar suggested that there should be minimum standards agreed between the EU and the UK, but there needed to be a court of arbitration between them.He also revealed details of the secret summit he had in October outside Liverpool with Mr Johnson which broke the deadlock in relation to Brexit. The pair agreed a deal which would mean no hard border in Ireland and instead the border would be down the Irish Sea.RapportMr Varadkar described the rapport between the two men.“I think it is a simple story really. It was two guys in a room in Wirral talking on our own for more than an hour,” he said.“We got down to business and we talked turkey. Sometimes when you do these things without officials present, it is easier. It was one of those strange conversations where the prime minister said, ‘my staff will kill me for saying this, but if I said this, what would you say back? If I move on this, would you move on that?’“We found out very quickly that we had shared objectives and that we could work together. That was a crucial moment in Wirral. Eventhough it was not all sorted that day, I knew leaving Liverpool Airport that things were looking promising again.”The Taoiseach said the EU will have the stronger hand in the forthcoming trade negotiations and that a trade deal cannot be agreed in a piecemeal fashion.“The final deal and the new relationship will have to be comprehensive. That is always the way with these types of relationships. When I hear people talking about piecemeal, it sound a bit like have cake and eat it. You can have a trade deal for the areas where you have an advantage and none where you haven’t. That’s not fair and it’s not something that will fly in Europe.”Mr Varadkar was asked if he thought Brexit would hasten the day there is a united Ireland. He repeated there is no majority for Irish unity in the north at present with unionists and nationalists commanding about 40 per cent of the electorate each while 20 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted for cross-party parties who “just want to get on with the day to day things like the health service and education and so on.“So, there isn’t yet a majority for unity in Northern Ireland. And that can’t happen until there is.“In the meantime, we should all commit ourselves to the Good Friday Agreement, power-sharing in Northern Ireland, ever closer cooperation between North and South, and then increasing close cooperation between Britain and Ireland.”Britain is due to the leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday night.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty ImagesThe Labour Party has said it is looking closely at the introduction of a four -day working week without any loss of pay. It also said it wanted to put in place an additional two public holidays each year to allow workers spend more time with their families and friends. Labour Party employment spokesman Ged Nash said there was no public holiday between the beginning of January and St Patrick’s Day or in July in the middle of the summer. He said Ireland already had fewer public holidays than elsewhere across Europe.Mr Nash said raising the minimum wage towards a real living wage, guaranteeing the right of all workers to be represented by a trade union and maintaining the State pension age at 66 years would be absolute requirements of the party in any future talks on coalition or support for any minority government. The Labour Party also said it wanted to introduce a right to flexible working hours and a right to switch off from dealing with work-related emails and phone calls outside working hours without receiving additional money. Mr Nash said people were being enslaved by new technologies. He said the party would establish a commission on the future of work. He said research the party had looked at indicated that a four-day week would make workers more productive and improve the bottom line of employers. “Everyone would be a winner”, he said. Mr Nash said the Labour Party would ask the Low Pay Commission to set out how the national minimum wage would remain above two thirds of median income as was originally the case in 2000. Mr Nash said employers would be required to negotiate with trade unions and everyone at work would have the right to union representation. He said the party had consulted with lawyers and academics and did not believe a constitutional amendment would be required to bring this change about. However he said if necessary the Labour Party would hold a constitutional referendum in the issue. He said the Labour Party would tackle the “gig economy” and eliminate bogus self employment and “if and when” employment arrangements.

Afghan militias are believed to be involved in the battle on the Syrian government side. Smuggling himself across the border, he travelled to a suburb south of Tehran and signed up at a mosque. Most of the Fatemiyoun\u0027s volunteers were from Iran\u0027s large community of Afghan migrant workers and refugees, researchers and officials said.A far smaller number are recruited directly from Afghanistan, sometimes encouraged by pro-Iran clerics.Economic hardship has been recruits\u0027 main motivation, according to a recent report by the United States Institute of Peace which interviewed fighters and their families, while some also sought adventure, or were driven by religious sentiment.Mehdi\u0027s wages began as soon as he joined up, he recalls, but so did indoctrination as instructors tried to whip up the recruits\u0027 religious feeling. Veterans say instructors stressed that Shia holy shrines were in danger from Syrian rebels and the Fatemiyoun had a duty to defend them.Pro-government fighters in Al-Bab, Aleppo province, in November 2016“From that day I was receiving my salary. And they started to work on our mind,” he said. “Both Afghans and Iranians were training us. Afghans were telling us something about war and working with weapons, but Iranians were working on our minds. We had so many religious programs that we were thirsty for martyrdom. We were counting down to go to Syria and die,“ he said.“They were telling us that our beliefs are the only thing we have and we should defend them.”Training was often cursory. If commanders were short of troops at the front, recruits sometimes only had 10 days of training, recalled another veteran who gave his name as Ali Reza.If the situation was better, it could be twice as long.“Some were asking why Iran\u0027s military does not intervene directly, and Iranians were saying that they don’t intervene directly through their military because US forces are there and could create more pressure between the two countries,” Ali Reza said.The Afghan militias were thrown into the battle for Aleppo alongside regular Syrian forces, seen here during fighting in the city in 2016Both men were pitched into the battle for Aleppo. The Fatemiyoun were directed by Iranian commanders and employed to breach defences, or clear the way ahead of Syrian forces.Casualty rates were often appalling. “In one of my most intense fights, our group had nearly 50 members but when we reached the rear base, only three or four were unhurt,“ he said. ”Two of my friends were killed there, one had a fiancé. I saw the deaths of my many friends by my own eyes in Syrian front lines.”Mehdi said he had served three tours of six months each, before deciding he had enough. “First, I got enough money and now I don’t need as much,” he said.He also felt the shrines he had vowed to defend were no longer in danger. Many of the Afghans who fought at the peak of the war have demobilised, staying in Iran to take advantage of their new legal status, or returning across the border to family.Those returning to Afghanistan are often viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who doubt their loyalties.Shia religious and political leaders in Afghanistan have almost all opposed sending Afghans to join the Fatemiyoun.Yet if the call to defend the holy shrines again, Mehdi said he would return. “If I feel they are again close to destroying shrines, I will not hesitate and will go back.”Comment: Labour are going nowhere until they wake up and grasp this simple truth about BrexitDefence in depthMonday evening news briefing: Plan to extract Britons from China\u0026#39s deadly virus zonePolitics latest news: Boris Johnson hints a \u0026#39strategic win\u0026#39 on Huawei is possibleAuschwitz survivor travels back to former hell, 75 years onComment: Rescuing Brits trapped in China is the last thing our government should do\tPalestinian president refuses to take Donald Trump\u0026#39s call as peace plan loomsPortuguese hacker named as leaker behind Isabel Dos Santos leaksComment: The promise of a \u0026#39Federal Britain\u0026#39 is no silver bullet for Labour\u0026#39s woes\tPlane skids off runway onto nearby street in IranComment: Of course Huawei is getting an easy ride.

RBKC was said to have acknowledged its building control officials failed to ask for comprehensive details about key areas including the cladding system, the insulation and the architectural crown.All three parts of the construction were found to have contributed to the spread of the fire. Grenfell Tower fire in picturesMr Millett said of the other corporate statements: Any member of the public reading these statements and taking them all at face value would be forced to conclude that everyone involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower did what they were supposed to do and nobody made any serious causative mistakes.All core participants who played a material part in Grenfell Tower have laid out a detailed case that it relied on others and how in no way was the work it did either substandard or non-compliant (with building regulations).In every case, what happened was, as each of them would have it, someone else\u0027s fault.Given the findings in the first phase of the inquiry that the building was not compliant with building regulations, Mr Millett said, this is unlikely.The key questions the Grenfell Tower Inquiry aims to answerHe continued: “If lessons are to be learnt from what went wrong at Grenfell Tower and the necessary changes to the construction industry are to be made it is important that all those who gave evidence to module and indeed who are called throughout phase two provide a truthful...account of what happened during the primary refurbishment. “Those who escaped from that burning building with their lives, or who lost loved ones and all that they possessed, are owed at the very least an honest and complete account from those witnesses who are in a position to explain why it happened.Studio E, which was hired by contractor Rydon to act as the main architects for the project, said in its opening statement it was a “conscientious, ethical and responsible” company. The company pointed the finger of blame at a “systemic issue” in the construction industry which allowed dangerous cladding products to be cleared for use on tall buildings. Fire and Rescue ServiceComment: Labour are going nowhere until they wake up and grasp this simple truth about BrexitDefence in depthMonday evening news briefing: Plan to extract Britons from China\u0026#39s deadly virus zonePolitics latest news: Boris Johnson hints a \u0026#39strategic win\u0026#39 on Huawei is possibleAuschwitz survivor travels back to former hell, 75 years onComment: Rescuing Brits trapped in China is the last thing our government should do\tPalestinian president refuses to take Donald Trump\u0026#39s call as peace plan loomsPortuguese hacker named as leaker behind Isabel Dos Santos leaksComment: The promise of a \u0026#39Federal Britain\u0026#39 is no silver bullet for Labour\u0026#39s woes\tPlane skids off runway onto nearby street in IranComment: Of course Huawei is getting an easy ride.

The safety and security of British nationals is always our primary concern.The Foreign Office recently updated its guidance to advise against all travel to Hubei province, which has been on lockdown for several days.But the guidance also added: If you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.Other countries including France, the United States and Japan have already mobilised plans to remove their citizens from Wuhan. The Spanish government also said on Monday it was planning to repatriate its citizens.The announcement came after Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, suggested UK citizens could be airlifted from China. Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan and elsewhere, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on Monday: I think I would be very sympathetic and I\u0027m sure the Foreign Office would be too.Mr Hunt said the NHS was well-equipped to deal with patients returning with the virus but warned that it could strain the service.This is a very difficult time of year for the NHS - it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies. I think the thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services, he said.I think it would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what comes to necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.Earlier on Monday, the medical director of Public Health England, Yvonne Doyle, said she would be surprised if coronavirus cases were not soon confirmed in Britain. As of Sunday, 52 people across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been tested for the deadly flu-like virus but all have returned negative.Prof  Doyle told the Today programme: The important thing here is to be aware of the case definition of what constitutes a risk to the person and to the population. A performer wears a face mask during Chinese New Year celebrations in LondonSo if somebody is unwell..if they have a cough, if they have fever, difficulty breathing and of course if they have been connected to Wuhan those are the four criteria.Otherwise we have a lot of people who are just very worried but well.Prof Doyle said efforts were continuing to trace the 2,000 people who have entered the UK from China on international flights.Coronavirus everything you need to know puffWe are now looking back to see whether any of them are still in the country, because some of them will have returned to China, but there are moves to identify them, she said.It\u0027s not always possible to find everybody but we are working to our best endeavours.England\u0027s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty also said there was a fair chance cases would emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to about 2,744 including 80 deaths, which have all occurred in China.The current risk to the public remains low, the health department said, adding that the Government is continuing to monitor the situation closely.Britons inside Wuhan have told of struggles to make contact with UK authorities. A pair of British teachers who have been working in Wuhan say they have not left their apartment for five days, that all transport has been stopped and there is no place to go and so we are pretty much stuck.Jason Neal and Sophie Hunt told BBC Breakfast said there had been no reassurance from the British authorities whom they have struggled to contact, possibly because of the time difference and them being closed over the weekend.People argue with riot police inside the lobby of a residential building in Hong Kong in protest against plans for an empty local housing estate to become a temporary quarantine campThey have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a ghost town.Mr Neal said: Even if the news is just to sit tight and nothing is going to change - I think it is just the silence that is disconcerting.We have not heard anything from outside of Wuhan for a week now.Mathematics teacher David Marland, 34, told the  how he knew he had to call a doctor when he stepped off a plane at Gatwick Airport last week.For the past decade Mr Marland has lived and worked in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of a dangerous epidemic that shows few signs of slowing down.David Marland has lived and worked in Wuhan but returned to Britain last weekWhat’s more, Mr Marland lives only five minutes from the seafood market suspected to be the source of the virus, and walks through it nearly every day. Indeed a coronavirus case was recently confirmed in his apartment block.But when he called the NHS 111 helpline, as suspected carriers have been advised to do, the answer was unexpected.Instead of being called in immediately for a test, he says he was asked only if he had “the sniffles”. When he replied in the negative, the specialist on the other end of the line told him to call back if he started feeling unwell. With that, the conversation was over.On Sunday, Mr Marland, 34, learned that the advice given to him may simply have been wrong. In a surprise announcement, Chinese officials suggested that carriers of coronavirus can actually spread the disease for up to two weeks without displaying any symptoms. If the Chinese are right, Mr Marland fears he and other potential carriers might be unwittingly carrying the deadly virus, and potentially spreading it to the public. Even his own relatives have asked him to stay away for fear of contracting the disease themselves.“I’m potentially a risk to other people,” he told the .“I’m still within the two week period so I could be spreading the disease everywhere without having any symptoms.”Numerous countries across the globe, including the UK, have introduced screening at airports in an attempt to identify people who may have coronavirus symptoms. But the limit here is that only those who are already ill will be picked up. So health experts say the most effective way to control the spread of viruses is an alert health system and high standards of infection control.A medic takes the temperature of a man at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in WuhanProf David Heymann, infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that perhaps the most valuable element of airport screening is telling passengers about the signs and symptoms of a disease and what they should do if they’re worried.“Educating the public is key,” he told The .People wearing face masks have become a defining image of large disease outbreaks, and this one is no different, with cities in Asia already reporting shortages as masks fly off the shelves. But in reality, the thin material masks do little to stop a respiratory virus spreading. “The face masks that we see people wearing are surgical face masks,” said Dr Mark Parrish, regional medical director of the medical and travel security firm International SOS. “As you breathe in and out you\u0027re breathing air from outside the face mask. So it will stop a little bit but not hugely.”Chinese New Year revellers in London wore face masks to the celebrations amid the coronavirus fearsJonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, added that face masks were proven to be effective in hospitals.“There are reports in literature that face masks in a hospital setting can protect health care workers. But there, they are being used for short periods by trained professions,changed frequently and properly disposed of. Those staff are also adopting good personal hygiene. “But in the general population it may even be the case that they’re not helpful at all,” he added.“If you don’t change them regularly enough, they could potentially start to trap viruses and eventually they can move through that mask into your respiratory tract.”  Dr Parrish added that heavy duty masks, called N95\u0027s, are far more effective than simple surgical masks for the general population. But these aren\u0027t fool-proof either. “These cause a tight seal around your nose and mouth so becomes harder to breathe air in - you don’t really want to give people with respiratory systems,” he said. There is currently no vaccine to protect against the novel coronavirus, although researchers in the US and China have already begun working on one, thanks to China\u0027s prompt sharing of the virus\u0027s genetic code. However, any vaccine will not be available for up to a year and would most likely be given to health workers most at risk of contracting the virus. How the coronavirus spreadsFor now, it is a case of containment. China has started building a 1,000-bed hospital to treat patients with the virus which it hopes to finish within days.Department for Health \u0026amp Social CareComment: Labour are going nowhere until they wake up and grasp this simple truth about BrexitDefence in depthMonday evening news briefing: Plan to extract Britons from China\u0026#39s deadly virus zonePolitics latest news: Boris Johnson hints a \u0026#39strategic win\u0026#39 on Huawei is possibleAuschwitz survivor travels back to former hell, 75 years onComment: Rescuing Brits trapped in China is the last thing our government should do\tPalestinian president refuses to take Donald Trump\u0026#39s call as peace plan loomsPortuguese hacker named as leaker behind Isabel Dos Santos leaksComment: The promise of a \u0026#39Federal Britain\u0026#39 is no silver bullet for Labour\u0026#39s woes\tPlane skids off runway onto nearby street in IranComment: Of course Huawei is getting an easy ride.

British citizens stranded in the ghost town that is the Chinese city of Wuhan, ground zero for the coronavirus epidemic, have spoken in recent days of their sense of abandonment.With supplies running low and no end in sight to the outbreak, many are questioning why the British government has been so slow to arrange an escape. And who can blame them? It must be terrifying to be stuck in a city in lockdown, roads and train lines blocked by the military, airports closed and no way of heeding the official Foreign Office advice to get out.There are thought to be at least 300 Brits caught in this predicament, ordinary people living in or visiting a city which finds itself in an extraordinary situation. But the last thing the British government should do is heed their pleas. The reality is that for a government tasked with protecting all its citizens, repatriation makes no sense at all.One of the most terrifying aspects of coronavirus is that, like the Spanish flu responsible for the 1918 pandemic which killed as many as 100 million people, it is infectious before symptoms begin to show. That means someone returning from Wuhan could blithely wander the streets spreading the disease before they even knew they were a threat.The introduction of a more rigid quarantine regime than the current system of self-policing would put the NHS under severe strain – and is certainly less than fool-proof.Quick spread of CoronavirusPutting aside the practicalities, isn’t there also something a little off about the suggestion this random group be treated differently from every other inidual unfortunate enough to be in Wuhan, solely on the grounds they are British passport holders?If Brits quality for such a preferential treatment as an airlift which puts the rest of the world in terrible danger, then why not other groups? Shouldn’t the children of Wuhan be spared? The elderly and vulnerable? In the arrogance of assuming one is deserving of special treatment just because one happens to be British, there is an inescapable whiff of, to use the dreadful phrase, white, or at least Western, privilege. It is a truth most of us ignore when we travel, because it has become so commonplace to do so: when we leave the safe shores of the United Kingdom, we lose its protections and must, to some extent, throw in our lot with the people we now dwell among. We see it in the despair of the teenage drug mules punished for smuggling noxious powders into exotic realms. The outrage at being shaken down for a bribe in parts of Africa or South America. The shock experienced by the under-insured when the bills arrive after medical care in the United States. Like the girl in the Pulp song, Common People, we are subconsciously confident that if we call our dad he can stop it all – that is, that if something goes wrong while we are on our travels, then daddy in the form of the Foreign Office will ride to the rescue. But the Government isn’t daddy. It doesn’t have infinite resources, a magic wand to suspend foreign legal processes or pick up the tab for our medical costs. And it certainly doesn’t have the cure for a particularly nasty bug with the potential to infect hundreds of thousands of us.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not just because the contestants look the same each year, or because their conversations are dull as dishwater. It’s about what they wear.\u0026nbspEvery year, the same cohort of aspiring Instagram influencers bounds into that sun-soaked villa claiming to be “looking for love” when in fact, the only thing they’re looking for is a contract with Boohoo. Or Missguided. Or Nasty Gal. Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels. Last season alone, female stars including Molly-Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and Amber Gill all landed up lucrative partnerships with Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo and MissPap, respectively – Gill’s is rumoured to be worth £1m. The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man. They follow in the footsteps of former contestants like Kem Cetinay, Amber Davies and Olivia Buckland, who have also gone on to partner with fast fashion brands since leaving the show.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.Winter Love Island 2020: Meet the 12 contestants Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Shaugna is a democratic services officer from London.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright.

The yomari were traditionally prepared as a specialty dish by members of the ethnic Newari community in Nepal for their festival, but demand became so great that they are now sold throughout the year.

Price ranges from 20 cents euro to 50 cents euroMen cook snail soup at the Omega street food restaurant in Koh Pich (Diamond Island) in Phnom Penh. The snail soup is made with lake snails, caught by hand by farmers in the provinces around Phnom Penh. The dish offers customers a traditional provincial style of food compared to the majority of restaurants in Cambodia that offer Chinese, western or neighboring Asian nations cuisine, only a few offer traditional Cambodian fare. The restaurant specialises in cooking snail soup and steamed frog with small rocksA woman puts a betel package, called quid, into her mouth made and sold at a street stall in Naypyitaw.  Betel quids, known as Kunya, are very popular in Myanmar, made of tobacco and small pieces of betel nut wrapped in a betel leaf and spread with a lime paste that are placed into the mouth to suck and chew. Betel is the seed of the Areca palm, and while it\u0027s consumption is common in Asia and the Pacific, it is banned in many western countries due to its negative health effects.

It is one of the most popular street foods in IndonesiaA street vendor prepares deep-fried curry fish balls, a street snack especially loved by young people, in Mong Kok, a busy night life district of Kowloon in Hong Kong. Since the so-called \u0027 fish ball revolution\u0027 riot in Mong Kok in 2016, where a crowd of New Year revellers tried to push a cart of boiling oil towards health officials who were checking for unlicensed street hawkers, the snack has also become a symbol of identity of the Hong Kong people\u0027s resistance to perceived creeping authoritarianism from China. Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product. Despite this, in 2012, local media Apple Daily reported that 375,000,000 fish balls were consumed per dayA vendor arranges fried insects on her street food cart on Khao San Road in Bangkok. The road houses many kinds of food but the most popular are fresh fruits, fried insects and pad thai. Fried insects attract the attention of tourists from all over the world. Bugs have been on the menu in Thailand for ages but a few years ago they have migrated from the forests to commercial farms and factories. The most popular method of preparation is to deep-fry crickets in oil and then sprinkle them with lemongrass slivers and chilis. They are crunchy and taste like fried shrimp. Pad thai is a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly served as street food and at most restaurants in ThailandA man sells baozi, or Chinese steamed meat buns, at a business district in Beijing.

Singapore has announced that it will be nominating its hawker culture, comprising over 6,000 hawkers who provide street food local dishes, for a Unesco\u0027s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Hawker centres were started in the 1970s in Singapore by moving street vendors into purpose-built facilities. There are over 110 such hawker centres in the country.

Chuan, pronounced as chwan, are small pieces of meat, but on rare occasions can be seafood, roasted on skewers. The food originated from the Xinjiang region of China and has been spread all across China\u0027s cities, where street food is popular.

Since the so-called \u0027 fish ball revolution\u0027 riot in Mong Kok in 2016, where a crowd of New Year revellers tried to push a cart of boiling oil towards health officials who were checking for unlicensed street hawkers, the snack has also become a symbol of identity of the Hong Kong people\u0027s resistance to perceived creeping authoritarianism from China. Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product. Despite this, in 2012, local media Apple Daily reported that 375,000,000 fish balls were consumed per dayA vendor arranges fried insects on her street food cart on Khao San Road in Bangkok. The road houses many kinds of food but the most popular are fresh fruits, fried insects and pad thai. Fried insects attract the attention of tourists from all over the world. Bugs have been on the menu in Thailand for ages but a few years ago they have migrated from the forests to commercial farms and factories. The most popular method of preparation is to deep-fry crickets in oil and then sprinkle them with lemongrass slivers and chilis. They are crunchy and taste like fried shrimp.

Hawker centres were started in the 1970s in Singapore by moving street vendors into purpose-built facilities. There are over 110 such hawker centres in the country.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit - dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics - would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She made an a**e out of herself – it’s was quite sad to see.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Everyone is hoping this is just a blip,” the source added.Created with Sketch.The 20 greatest TV theme songs of all time Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 20) The Wire (“Way Down in the Hole” by Tom Waits) (2002-2008)A rotating cast of musicians were tasked with covering Tom Waits’ formidable dirge “Way Down in the Hole” for The Wire’s theme, including Steve Earle and The Blind Boys of Alabama. No one beat Waits at his own game, though, the gravelly voiced king of the gutters used for the prolific drama’s second series. Regardless of who was singing, the message would remain the same: “When you walk through the garden  You gotta watch your back.”220 19) Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (“Unbreakable” by The Gregory Brothers and Mike Britt) (2015-2019)Having the YouTube-famous Gregory Brothers, responsible for viral hit “Bedroom Intruder”, remix a news report of the show’s protagonist being rescued from an underground cult for the theme song is unbelievably strange, but also brilliant. The warped, breakneck burst of bubblegum ridiculousness that it became is truly uncharted grounds, tearing down walls separating television, streaming services and video platforms in a very catchy fashion.320 18) Twin Peaks (“Twin Peaks Theme” by Angelo Badalamenti) (1990-2017)That they reused this theme for the recent Twin Peaks revival, an uncompromising, phantasmagoric trip through the mind of David Lynch, is intentionally and deliciously jarring, and that’s only because Badalementi’s theme so perfectly embodied the kitschy, nostalgia-drenched warmth of the original Nineties series, a simpler time. With ominous shadows lurking just beneath the beautiful crescendos, though, maybe Twin Peaks was never what it seemed.420 17) The Twilight Zone (“Main Title Theme” by Marius Constant) (1959-1964)The Twilight Zone, an anthology series that was light-years ahead of the curve, had a stellar soundtrack predating an impressive and abundant pantheon of great horror scores, spooking us way before we had Halloween or The Exorcist. It’s a bit of Frankenstein’s Monster, consisting of a number of promotional pieces haphazardly spliced together, but from the messy birth is a tense, ethereal and insanely influential hair-raiser. 520 16) Toast of London (“Take My Hand” by Matt Berry) (2012- )As sung by co-creator and lead actor Matt Berry, one of the most under-appreciated and multifaceted talents of the decade, “Take My Hand” is rousing and poignant. Toast of London, a gloriously abstract, untamed animal of a comedy, is often punctuated by unexpected bursts of Berry’s singing, though no other performance quite reaches the loveliness of this theme – an emotional anchor in a sea of weirdness.press image from Lis ClucasKuba WieczorekChannel 4620 15) The Sopranos (“Woke Up This Morning (Chosen One Mix)” by Alabama 3) (1999-2007)Alabama 3, an alternative rock band from Brixton, provides the theme song to a show that consistently outdoes itself with its music choices (see also: the series’ final few minutes). “Woke Up This Morning (Chosen One Mix)” is greasy and sleazy and Tom Waits-ish, a swamp of ominous synths and guitar licks, dipping into the weirder and artsier tendencies that The Sopranos would often ulge in. 720 14) The Simpsons (“The Simpsons Theme” by Danny Elfman) (1989- )With each title sequence, The Simpsons continually finds news way for America’s favourite family to come together on their couch, although the soundtrack to these journeys remains an unchanging monument. Honestly, “The Simpsons Theme” has transcended iconic status and is essentially a holy text by this point excluding it from this list would have been sacrilegious. Shout out to Lisa who always knocks her sax solo out of the park.820 13) Postman Pat (“Postman Pat \u0026amp His Black and White Cat” by Bryan Daly) (1981-2006)This sleepy little lullaby of a theme song recalls the sensation of first waking in the morning, enthused by the feeling that everything is okay in the world. Bryan Daly’s almost whispered vocals speak of a heart-warming, enviously simple life for our hero Pat and his black and white cat “Pat feels he’s a really happy man.” It’s a doorway to a world that, no matter the age, you would be happy to settle into.920 12) The Office UK (“Handbags and Gladrags” arranged by Big George) (2001-2003)What Gervais and Merchant’s version of The Office does so well is to embrace the humanity of everyday life, at-times hilarious, at-times pathetic. “Handbags and Gladrags”, originally written by Mike D’Abo of Manfred Mann but repurposed here by Big George, is unashamedly sombre and hungover. It sounds like that contrasting look of persistence to achieve better things and resigned acceptance on the face of every Monday morning commuter.1020 11) M*A*S*H (“Suicide is Painless” by Johnny Mandel) (1972-1983)The lyrics to “Suicide is Painless”, omitted from the television title sequence but so married to the melody that they hang over it like a ghost, are heart-wrenching. They draw out the tragic, underlying nature of M*A*S*H, a comedy at heart, with their absence only highlighting the repression of this sadness. It’s unique and unprecedented in the sense that, each time it plays, it forces you to reconsider what it is you are about to see.1120 10) Knight Rider (“Knight Rider Theme” by Stu Phillips and Glen A. Larson) (1982-1986)The “Knight Rider Theme”, composed of pulsating, tensile synths and ticking programmed drums, is a very Eighties, Blade Runner-esque prediction of what the future would sound like: apocalyptic, sleek and synthetic. A bit like KITT itself, it’s nowhere near being timeless in that sense, but it’s undoubtedly cool even as a product of its time. 1220 9) It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (“Temptation Sensation” by Heinz Kiessling) (2005- )The It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia title sequence is all about ingenious contrasts. The episode titles often hilariously contradict the prior few minutes (see: “I’m gonna save my Dad!” into “Mac Kills His Dad), the shots of nighttime Philadelphia prove it’s not actually “always sunny”, and, best of all, the theme song hints at a certain lusciousness and grace. This, of course, is never the case. That “Temptation Sensation” is public domain makes it even more perfect.1320 8) Happy Days (“Happy Days” by Pratt \u0026amp McClain) (1974-1984)Faced with declining ratings, Happy Days doubled down on the feel-good factor and comedy aspects for the third series. This new theme song, replacing the equally recognisable “Rock Around the Clock”, follows suit, borrowing the same idea of making the most of the time we have but blowing it out to its most cheery, broad and archetypal potential.1420 7) Friends (“I’ll Be There For You” by The Rembrandts) (1994-2004)The Rembrandts got it pretty spot on – no matter what you do to escape it, this song will always be there. A bit like an over-eager best friend, the track brings a certain comfort, a sense of normality and is boundlessly, almost annoyingly joyful. You can’t help but love it unconditionally.1520 6) The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (“Yo Home to Bel Air” by The Fresh Prince) (1990-1996)Never before has a backstory been so endlessly recitable. Pop maestro Quincy Jones collaborated with renowned 80s hip hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff and the The Fresh Prince, who happened to be starring in the show, to create a genuine cultural touchstone in just 15 minutes. Much like his character, Will Smith makes everything he does look completely effortless, including writing a theme song for the ages.1620 5) Doctor Who (“Doctor Who Theme Music” by Ron Grainer) (1963- )The fact that this theme still evokes the excitement of stepping into new worlds almost 60 years on is telling. Composed in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Ron Grainer and Delia Derbyshire’s otherworldly masterpiece has let loose the imaginations (and nightmares) of children for decades, itself a small but sturdy vessel that transcends time and space.1720 4) Dad’s Army (“Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Hitler?” by Bud Flanagan) (1968-1977)Distinctly unimposing and charming yet equipped with a biting sense of self-depreciation and an unmatched persistence, the theme for Dad’s Army perfectly captures British spirit. In fact, dismissing Hitler’s reign as a “little game” may be one of the most devastatingly British blows ever landed. Bud Flanagan, a vaudevillian comic in his own right, outdid himself.1820 3) Curb Your Enthusiasm (“Frolic” by Luciano Michelini) (2000- )Just beating out Seinfeld’s iconic slap bass is the hilariously cocksure clown march that soundtracks Larry David’s second masterpiece, Curb Your Enthusiasm. “There was something circus-y about it,” he once explained. “It tells the audience: don’t take this seriously.” It’s near-impossible to hear it without picturing a slow zoom into his helpless face, forever mocking his inability to understand a world that goes right over his bald, emblematic head.1920 2) Cheers (“Where Everybody Knows Your Name” by Gary Portnoy) (1982-1993)The quintessential theme song, almost unanimously agreed upon as the greatest of all time. Gary Portnoy’s “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” is that warm rush you feel stepping in from the cold or, more aptly, a much-needed beer after a long day. A deep exhalation of a programme, Cheers was that sense of relief for so many people, and the theme couldn’t have captured or acknowledged that more perfectly.2020 1) Batman (“Batman Theme” by Neal Hefti) (1966-1968)From the giddy, opening horn flourish to the driving guitar, the chorus of “Batman”’s to the hits of brass choreographed to our hero punching out crooks, you’d be hard pressed to find a better-known superhero theme. Although the franchise would return to darker places, the unabashed campness here harks back to the innocence of watching cartoons on weekend mornings.120 20) The Wire (“Way Down in the Hole” by Tom Waits) (2002-2008)A rotating cast of musicians were tasked with covering Tom Waits’ formidable dirge “Way Down in the Hole” for The Wire’s theme, including Steve Earle and The Blind Boys of Alabama. No one beat Waits at his own game, though, the gravelly voiced king of the gutters used for the prolific drama’s second series. Regardless of who was singing, the message would remain the same: “When you walk through the garden  You gotta watch your back.”220 19) Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (“Unbreakable” by The Gregory Brothers and Mike Britt) (2015-2019)Having the YouTube-famous Gregory Brothers, responsible for viral hit “Bedroom Intruder”, remix a news report of the show’s protagonist being rescued from an underground cult for the theme song is unbelievably strange, but also brilliant.

But it did say that it will be moving the logos of the pages on search results – known as favicons – in an attempt to make them more palatable to users.Google search results get unusual new updateLast week we updated the look of Search on desktop to mirror what’s been on mobile for months, Google said in a post from one of its official search liaison accounts. We’ve heard your feedback about the update. We always want to make Search better, so we’re going to experiment with new placements for faviconsOur experimenting will begin today. Over the coming weeks, while we test, some might not see favicons while some might see them in different placements as we look to bring a modern look to desktop.The change initially arrived on mobile, and the company claimed it had been well received by those users on smaller screens, as it helps people more quickly see where information is coming from and they can see a prominent bolded ad label at the top.It also said that early tests of the new design on desktop had been positive, but that it was always incorporating feedback from users.We are experimenting with a change to the current desktop favicon, and will continue to iterate on the design over time, Google said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On one side, I’m very grateful that what I make can be acknowledged in a world like this, but also it sucks that whenever we – and I mean guys that look like me – do anything that’s genre-bending, they always put it in the rap or urban category.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I don’t like that ‘urban’ word, it’s just a politically correct way to say the ‘n’ word to me.”Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border.

She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past.

He added: “So when I hear that I’m like, ‘Why can’t we just be in pop, do you know what I mean?’ Half of me feels like the rap nomination was a backhanded compliment, like, ‘Oh, my little cousin wants to play the game, let’s give him the unplugged controller so he can shut up and feel good about it.’Nick Jonas performed at Grammys with food in his teethAll the Grammys 2020 winnersThe 4 biggest talking points from the Grammy Awards 2020The artist’s win is his first-ever Grammy triumph after being nominated two other times, for Flower Boy in 2018 and as a feature on Frank Ocean’s Channel Orange in 2013.He performed at the ceremony at the Staples Centre\u0026nbspin Los Angeles and, shortly after the win, Jaden Smith,\u0026nbspwho has previously teased fans\u0026nbspabout the nature of his and Tyler’s relationship, tweeted: “My boyfriend just won a Grammy.”Tyler the Creator\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was their fourth and final spacewalk since November to revive the instrument\u0027s crippled cooling system.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCongratulations ... the AMS pump system is now leak tight, tweeted the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, which helps run the spectrometer.Mission Control cautioned it was too soon to declare success with the space station\u0027s premier science instrument, but noted: It still has a good heartbeat.Last month, Morgan and Parmitano installed new coolant pumps on the spectrometer. They went back out Saturday to check for any leaks in the plumbing.Parmitano quickly discovered a leak in one of the eight coolant lines — the first one he tested — and tightened the fitting. Our day just got a little more challenging, Mission Control observed.The line still leaked after a mandatory one-hour wait, and Parmitano tightened it again. Finally, success — the leak was gone. Let us all take a breath, Mission Control urged. By then, the astronauts were already halfway into their six-hour spacewalk.Mission Control acknowledged the leak added some unwanted drama to the spacewalk. Everybody\u0027s hearts stopped, Mission Control told the astronauts. Parmitano wondered aloud what his heart rate was when the leak erupted. It either flat-lined or spiked, one of the two.It was hard fought today, really well done. Cool heads prevailed, Mission Control said as the spacewalk drew to a close.Barring further trouble, the spectrometer — launched to the space station in 2011 — will have its coolant lines filled with more carbon dioxide Sunday. One pump will be turned on as early as Monday and the remaining three Tuesday. That could lead to the resumption of science observations by Wednesday.NASA described the spectrometer spacewalks as the most complicated since the Hubble Space Telescope repair missions a couple decades ago. Unlike Hubble, this spectrometer was never intended for astronaut handling in orbit, and once it started faltering in 2014, it took NASA years to devise a repair plan.Morgan and Parmitano had to cut into stainless steel pipes to bypass the spectrometer\u0027s old, degraded coolant pumps on a previous spacewalk. Then they spliced the tubes into the new pumps — no easy job when working in bulky gloves. New tools had to be created for the intricate job.We did it. We all did it, Morgan said once he was back inside.Astronaut Jessica Meir noted that the day ended up being more interesting than anyone envisioned. But you guys rolled with all the punches and got the job done.. ... Dinner is waiting, she said.The massive 7 12-ton (6,800-kilogram) spectrometer was launched to the space station on NASA\u0027s next-to-last shuttle flight. Until it was shut down late last year for the repair work, it had studied more than 148 billion charged cosmic rays. The project is led by Samuel Ting, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The repairs should allow the spectrometer to continue working for the rest of the life of the space station, or another five to 10 years. It was designed to operate for only three years.NASA\u0027s two other astronauts on board, Meir and Christina Koch, performed two spacewalks over the past 1 12 weeks to upgrade the space station\u0027s solar power system.Altogether, this station crew went out on nine spacewalks — or 61 hours in total. That\u0027s more than any other station expedition.Parmitano, Koch and Russian Alexander Skvortsov return to Earth in less than two weeks.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not real. It’s speculative,” Norton told The Times. “There is no truth behind it, unless journalists know something more than I do.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe added: “It’s bizarre and quite flattering to be even considered in that world, but beyond that? Pure speculation.”Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year.

Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit - dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics - would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a depressing fact that films directed by previous winners have more chance of being nominated than those directed by newcomers.Because of this, the\u0026nbspbest film in any given year almost never wins the evening’s most coveted prize – in fact, it’s sometimes\u0026nbspnot even\u0026nbspnominated in the first place.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOver the decades, there have been countless glaring omissions\u0026nbsp– films that were nominated but were beaten by far inferior films\u0026nbspand classic films\u0026nbspthat failed to secure a single nomination.As the 2020 Oscars approach – a ceremony that’s fast becoming a two-horse race between a film that actually deserves the top prize (Parasite) and a film that does not (1917) – we’ve run through 20 brilliant films that you would have expected to be a\u0026nbspBest Picture winner, but weren’t.Click through the bellow gallery to see what films made the listCreated with Sketch.Oscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley. The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President\u0027s Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford\u0027s weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy\u0027s most egregious.  Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn\u0027t even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning). Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.1023 Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee\u0027s Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether.   Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese\u0027s Goodfellas. But no – Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances with Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature Pulp Fiction won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes in 1994 – a success he failed to match back on home turf.

That it was completely ignored in favour of Braveheart is a huge travesty.You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo, but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers). It lost out to The English Patient.Having won Best Director five years previous for Schindler\u0027s List, Steven Spielberg was strongly expected to take home the top prizes for his Second World War epic. Cue Shakespeare In Love upsetting everybody.David Fincher\u0027s Facebook drama got shunned in favour of British patriotism in an Oscar two-horse race for the ages that ultimately saw The King\u0027s Speech crowned winner.1823 We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)Lynne Ramsay has directed two films that would have been deserving of Best Picture: You Were Never Really Here and this, We Need to Talk About Kevin. It\u0027s easy to see why Hollywood was temporarily more charmed by The Artist, but it\u0027s clear which film will stand the test of time.It\u0027s almost unthinkable to recall that the Coen brothers\u0027 Inside Llewyn Davis only scored two Oscar nominations in the cinematography and sound mixing categories, respectively. In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy\u0027s biggest omissions. Still, it would have had a hard time winning over 12 Years a Slave.For the 2015 Oscars race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood. Richard Linklater\u0027s labour of love, shot intermittently over 12 years, ultimately failed to win. If there\u0027s any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years. Jordan Peele may have taken home the Best Original Screenplay award, but the stars aligned for Guillermo del Toro\u0027s fantasy The Shape of Water instead.Roma was strongly expected to become the first ever foreign language film to win Best Picture.

They shine so intensely that they challenge traditional astrophysical models, which have been unable to account for such a bright star.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow scientists think they have found the cause of the blazing brightness coming out of\u0026nbspSN\u0026nbsp2006gy. And they hope that it could shed light on where other such superluminous supernovae get their intensity from.The new breakthrough came when researchers discovered that the star gained its intense brightness when a normal supernova crashed into a shell of material that surrounded it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

They suggested that vast amounts of iron could account for that particular line, as researchers call it – and when they tested that scenario, it worked.Scientists detect ‘unknown’ burst of gravitational waves in spaceIt became even more exciting when it quickly turned out that very large amounts of iron was needed to make the lines - at least a third of the Sun\u0027s mass - which directly ruled out some old scenarios and instead revealed a new one,\u0026nbspsaid Anders Jerkstrand from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University.The researchers suggest that before SN 2006gy\u0026nbspbecame what it is today, there was a double star made up of a white dwarf as big as Earth, and a huge hydrogen-rich massive star the size of our solar system. As the bigger star became even bigger, the smaller one was caught up in it and fell in towards the centre.When it got there, the white dwarf exploded into a Type Ia supernova – a normal supernova. That then collided with the envelope surrounding it, creating the giant collision that sent the light streaming across the universe.That a Type Ia supernova appears to be behind SN\u0026nbsp2006gy\u0026nbspturns upside down what most researchers have believed, says Anders\u0026nbspJerkstrand.That a white dwarf can be in close orbit with a massive hydrogen-rich star, and quickly explode upon falling to the centre, gives important new information for the theory of double star evolution and the conditions necessary for a white dwarf to explode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her husband grows rice during the rainy season and the rest of the time performs duties as a marabou (fortune teller). Djifanghor, 27, is a single mother who lives alone in the village of Niaguis with her mother. After her father died in 2008 her eldest brother was forced to work away to protect the family income. Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Her parents have always traditionally farmed rice \u0026amp peanut crops but have noticed the rainy season is unstable – sometimes there is more rain and sometimes there is not enough. Elie, 27, along with her family fled Oussouye in the Ziguinchor Region of Senegal in 1998 at the height of the conflict. She recalls stories of how the rebel groups lit fuel around shelters and make-shift homes and those residents who tried to escape were shot. “I still hear the crying and screams of those who perished … that is still what I have in my mind”. Dry inlet at Mandina village near Sedhiou. In recent years water reserves where Cattle used to graze the lush grass at the bank has dropped significantly. All that remains are the discarded nets from a once active fishing area for locals, now a vast area of cracked mud and salt crystals.Khady, 32, lives 4km from Ziguinchor. She participated in both the Agricultural Training camp in December 2018 and spent 3 months at the Incubation camp where she learnt how to transform her crops.A dry inlet bed at Mandina near Sedhiou, where cattle once grazed the lush vegetation on the banks – now all that remains are their footprints and hoof marksAlima, 31, says her ancestors have always been farmers: “My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother all were, but they farmed very differently. They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54). I’m very happy now that my vegetable garden is doing better. I hope it will continue to be successful, otherwise, this will affect my family, I just love to see my garden grow.”Aida, 36, lives in Takou village, near Sedhiou. She has five children and is 8 months pregnant but still works tirelessly on her small holding and with her chickens. The family only eat twice a day but Aida has a business plan to grow her poultry farm. “My mother used to grow rice and peanuts just for food. People still do grow these here but only in the rainy season, which is very short. Lydie, 25, lives in Boukitingho near Ziguinchor. She attended the Ampa Awagna Y CareYMCA course and learned how to upscale the vegetables she grows by turning produce from the market into syrup, juice and marmalade. This enables her to earn a more consistent income the whole year-round. She is already teaching other women in the village the new skills she learned at the course. “We have a joint piece of land in the village where we can grow our crops, and there we grow carrots, salad, onions and maize.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to climate change. Beneficiaries like Fatou are able to create sustainable lives for themselves and their families.Bouya, 23, lives in a village on the outskirts of Kolda. An orphan, she lost both her parents to illness. Until now Bouya has been totally dependent on her uncle for support. “I’ve just completed the agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna and I am now planning to develop my own smallholding. The plot of land belonged to my father.  My idea is to start growing okra, lettuce, tomato and cucumber – okra is a great crop because it is resistant to the heat.Laurentine, 26, runs a smallholding of pigs near Kolda. She is using the new farming methods she learnt on the Ampa Awangna camp and is extremely positive about the future. “Before the training, we used traditional methods. The programme taught me the modern way is to keep them in the shelter as when they wander around they can bring back diseases”. She now has 40 pigs and hopes in the next 10 years to move to a much larger holding where she wants 200-300 pigs.Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Having excelled at the initial 2-week agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna, Belange was asked to complete the 50-day intensive agricultural camp. She explained: “When I returned, I started growing in my vegetable garden, rearing pigs and poultry. I am earning much more than I did before the training. I’m growing tomatoes, peppers and chillis and I have much more output. Our life is better now – we don’t need to get help from others or have to ask people for money.”Khady, 32, watering her crops of Aubergine and Ochre near Ziguinchor. Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”Fatou, 30, comes from a family of farmers approximately 20km away from the village of Bousra where she now lives with her son Ibu.

Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”According to estimates from UN agencies, the conflict in Casamance, Senegal, claimed the lives of over 5,000 people. The Movement of Democratic Forces in Casamance (MFDC) emerged in 1982 as an armed separatist group advocating for independence, creating a guerilla force who began attacks on the Senegalese army in 1990.In lower Casamance, 78 villages were completely destroyed, creating\u0026nbspover 60,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and subjected them to a life of fewer opportunities. Tens of thousands also crossed borders seeking refuge in Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia.Although an eventual ceasefire was implemented in 2014, today few MFDC combatants remain and violent incidents are in decline. The fear of sporadic attacks has now been replaced by far greater fears of youth unemployment and food insecurities driven by the changing climate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHigh levels of poverty and hunger persist in Senegal despite solid economic growth in recent years. Chronic malnutrition affects\u0026nbspapproximately 17 per cent of children younger than 5 years of age, according to the UN World Food Program.Countries in the Sahel who rely on agriculture as primary sources of food and income are most at risk of crises and disasters. Unpredictable weather patterns, frequent droughts, floods and land desalinisation threaten the livelihoods of vulnerable communities.In Dakar, street artists from all over the world make their markThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated: “A number of countries in Africa who already face semi-arid conditions may see a reduction in projected crop yield by up to 50 per cent\u0026nbspin 2020 and reduced revenues by as much as 90 per cent by 2100.”However, a new generation of small scale farming has emerged from women in the region. They are defying\u0026nbspwhat predominantly male farming practices\u0026nbsphave done for generations and are adapting to the climate changes.Most Senegalese\u0026nbsphave noticed changes in the weather and seasons – they talk of drought, increases in temperature and distinctly shorter rainy seasons but most do not draw the connection with global climate change.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to the climate crisis.Leigh Daynes, CEO for Y Care International, explains:\u0026nbsp“The high unemployment and poverty levels experienced by young people in this remote and rural area of Casamance have only been further exacerbated by climate change. Families are now really struggling to cope with the shortfall of crops and having enough food to eat.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But he added: “What we don’t know is how far it’s going to spread, that really is something we need to plan for all eventualities.”China’s national health commission revealed the disease’s ability to spread is getting stronger and infections could continue to rise. A handful of cases of infection have been reported in other countries, including Thailand, Australia, the United States, France and Canada, although no fatalities have been recorded outside China.The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.\u0026nbspBritons urged to leave Wuhan but ministers won\u0027t commit to airliftsFrance to evacuate citizens from China’s Wuhan amid coronavirus fearsLatest China travel updates as coronavirus outbreak worsensCoronavirus: Hong Kong protesters set fire to planned quarantine buildIt can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.Health minister Ma Xiaowei said the virus can be infectious during its incubation period – before symptoms show – which ranges from one to 14 days.China has temporarily banned live animal trade across the country in markets, supermarkets, restaurants and online.Any place breeding wildlife should be isolated\u0026nbspand the transportation of wildlife should be suspended, the country’s market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement. It comes after the virus was traced to a seafood market in Wuhan believed to have been illegally selling live animals.The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) director-general was on his way to Beijing to confer with Chinese officials and health experts about the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday.In a tweet, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he wanted to “strengthen our partnership” with China “in providing further protection against the outbreak”.\u0026nbspThe Geneva-based WHO also said editors of major scientific journals had agreed to share any papers about the new coronavirus with it before publication, with authors’ consent, and that this would help inform its assessment and guidance.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Meanwhile, Britons remaining in Wuhan, the Chinese province at the centre of the outbreak, have been urged to leave the area if they are able to do so.Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said the government was “looking at all options” to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports officials have been asked to examine the logistics for an airlift from the city.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollow the latest updatesBeijing reports first death from coronavirus, Chinese state TV saysDeath toll rises to 81Some 17 cities with more than 50 million people placed on lockdownMore than 50 people test negative for virus in UKBritons in Chinese province at centre of outbreak urged to evacuateSpain and Portugal working to repatriate nationals from WuhanThe governments of Spain and Portugal are working with China and the EU to repatriate their nationals in the Wuhan area struck by coronavirus, according to the two countries’ foreign ministers.\u0026nbsp“We\u0027re working ... with our consulate in Beijing, and officials in China and the European Union to repatriate around 20 Spaniards in Wuhan, Hubei, the epicentre of the coronavirus. We will continue to update on any advances,” Arancha Gonzalez Laya, Spain’s foreign minister, wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Augusto Santos Silva, Portugal’s foreign minister, has told state broadcaster RTP that his ministry is exploring whether Portuguese citizens in Wuhan could return on a civilian plane with citizens from other European countries.\u0026nbsp“Unlike other countries such as the United States or France, who have large numbers of citizens in Wuhan and carry out their own repatriation programmes, it makes more sense for a country like Portugal, which has only a few citizens there, to carry out coordinated operations, if possible,” he said.\u0026nbspBetween 10 and 14 Portuguese citizens are reportedly in Wuhan, according to local media.\u0026nbspThe outbreak has killed 81 people in China so far and infected more than 2,800 globally, most of them in China.The mayor of the Chinese city where the deadly virus broke out has said he would be willing to resign if it helps the government contain its spread.Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV both he and Wuhan\u0027s Communist Party secretary are willing to take responsibility for closing off the city, including being removed from office.As the virus spread through China and overseas, transportation links to the city were cut last week to prevent more people from leaving.Mr Zhou also responded to allegations the city was slow to disclose information in the early days of the outbreak, saying local governments are restricted from releasing information about infectious diseases without authorisation.Dubai\u0027s Emirates airline is advising its flight crew to stay in their hotels when on a layover in China due to the new coronavirus outbreak.\u0026nbspEmirates flies to three mainland China cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. It does not fly to Wuhan, where the virus first appeared.The director-general of the World Health Organisation has flown to China to meet with government officials and health experts trying to contain the spread of a deadly virus that has killed 81 people in China and infected 2,750.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, said the UN\u0026nbsphealth agency wants to understand the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak.Last week, WHO held off on declaring the virus a global health emergency. It said China had taken very strong measures — including locking down cities that are home to 50 million people — that the agency hoped would be effective in containing the virus and short in duration.Mr Tedros said he would not hesitate to reconvene the WHO emergency committee at a moment\u0027s notice if the situation in China changed. He said that could happen in a day if that was needed.Beijing has reported its first death caused by the coronavirus,\u0026nbspthe state television station CCTV said.\u0026nbspThe 50-year-old, who had been to Wuhan, returned to the capital city and had been confirmed infected with the virus on 22 January, CCTV reported.Three new cases of coronavirus infection have been identified in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and\u0026nbspPrevention has announced.\u0026nbspOne case was found in Arizona and two others in California.Boris Johnson has insisted plans are being worked on to help UK citizens in Wuhan and assured we are doing everything to screen people arriving from affected regions.In an interview at the King\u0027s College London Mathematics School after launching a post-Brexit visa plan, the prime minister was asked for detail on how frustrated citizens would be assisted.\u0026nbspWe are looking at everything we can to give reassurance to those people in Wuhan and you will be hearing a bit more in due course but I don\u0027t want to pre-empt the decisions we are going to make, he replied.\u0026nbspObviously, we are doing everything we can to ensure that people who do come to this country are properly screened and checked if they have come from an area that is known to have the infection.\u0026nbspSo far there is still no case of somebody with coronavirus here the UK but clearly there are a lot of cases in China and it is spreading.\u0026nbspA further person in Scotland has tested negative for coronavirus, taking the total to seven.A pair of British teachers who have been working in Wuhan say they have not left their apartment for five days, that all transport has been stopped and there is no place to go and so we are pretty much stuck.Jason Neal and Sophie Hunt told BBC Breakfast there has been no reassurance from the British authorities whom they have struggled to contact, possibly because of the time difference and them being closed over the weekend. They have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a ghost town.Mr Neal said: Even if the news is just to sit tight and nothing is going to change - I think it is just the silence that is disconcerting.We have not heard anything from outside of Wuhan for a week now.He said there is a support group for people who may need help and to get masks and some volunteers are going out to make deliveries.Ms Hunt said emailing and trying to ring the authorities has brought a useless automated response back from the embassy saying not to go to the area.She feels the Chinese authorities have made the right decision by shutting down the city, adding: All we keep hearing is that the death toll is accelerating every day. All we can do really is sit tight and wait for more news.Although it is hard us being stuck here, we know that it is the safest possible option for us at the moment.Hospital workers caring for those infected with coronavirus\u0026nbspare reportedly wearing adult diapers because they do not have time to go to the bathroom:Britain is talking to its international partners to find solutions to help British and other foreign nations leave Wuhan, a spokesman for Boris Johnson has said.\u0026nbspThe Foreign Office have said this morning that they are exploring options for British nationals leaving the province. The Foreign Office are in close contact with international partners, including the US\u0026nbspand European countries, to investigate possible solutions, the prime minister\u0027s spokesman told reporters.The safety of British nationals is our top priority.China will ensure ample supplies to Wuhan\u0027s markets and maintain price stability, Premier Li Keqiang said\u0026nbspduring a visit to Wuhanon Monday, CCTV state television reported.Mr Li went to the city to inspect efforts to contain the epidemic, and spoke with patients and medical staff.France has said it expected to evacuate hundreds of its 800 citizens from Wuhan.\u0026nbspFrench citizens will be repatriated by airplane to France, with the agreement of Chinese authorities. This will take place midweek, the country\u0027s health minister, Agnes Buzyn, told reporters on Sunday.\u0026nbspEvacuees will have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspState Department said on Sunday it would evacuate personnel from its Wuhan consulate to the US and will offer a limited number of seats to private US citizens.The Spanish government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate Spanish nationals from Wuhan, the country\u0027s foreign minister has said.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re working ... with our consulate in Beijing, and officials in China and the European Union to repatriate around 20 Spaniards in Wuhan, Hubei, the epicentre of the coronavirus. We will continue to update on any advances, Arancha Gonzalez Laya wrote on Twitter.Big businesses across China are temporarily shutting stores or advising staff to work from home to guard against the spread of the cornavirus.\u0026nbspCompanies are also offering longer holidays, cancelling events and imposing quarantine, as they brace for longer-term impact following China\u0027s weekend decision to extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to 2 February, in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.\u0026nbspHotpot restaurant chain Haidilao International Holding said it would shut stores across China from Sunday to Friday, while gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd and social media firm ByteDance told staff to work from home.Many companies, including e-commerce firm Pinduoduo, bank UBS Group AG and property developer Country Garden also advised employees returning from Wuhan or Hubei province to stay in quarantine at home.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove.

He asked: ‘How old are you ’ I said ‘sixteen’, Ivor tells Sun Online.For a millisecond, he stopped, then he said: ‘Alright, go to the right, meaning to the workers’ side.It was a lucky escape for the young Hungarian who wouldve been sent to his deathMengele realised he was only a child - and no use for hard labour.Ivors mother and seven of his siblings were sent left to their deaths in Auschwitz gas chambers— he never saw any of them again.Today,  years since the liberation of Auschwitz, -year-old Ivor still can’t comprehend the horrors of the worst extermination camp the world has ever known.“The truth sounds so horric - it’s very hard to comprehend what happened, Ivor says .But it’s even harder to believe it could happen againone is not careful.Growing up in Southern Hungary in the s, Ivor was no stranger to anti-Semitism.“Going to school was, literally, like running the gauntlet. There was nothing unusual about being cursed at or spat at or even punched.“But, somehow or another, that was part and parcel of le. You accepted that you were a Jew - so you were entitled to suffer for it.”As an ally of the Axis powers, Hungary fought alongside the Nazis during World War Two.Leading up to and throughout the war, the Hungarian government passed a raft of anti-Semitic laws emulating those introduced by Hitler in Germany.Jews were forced out of their jobs, had to abide by a curfew and were forbidden from marrying Christians.They stopped short of enacting Hitler’s final solution — the planned genocide of the Jewish people — but still sent thousands of working-age Jews, including Ivor’s father and elder brother, to labour battalions.These groups were Nazi Germany’s army of slaves staffed by the regimes’ racially persecuted populations.They were forced to carry out back-breaking work on the frontline, forbidden from defending themselves with weapons, and they were even made to clear minefields with their bare hands.By  it was clear Germany would lose the war. Knowing this, Hungary made peace overtures to the Allied forces.When German High Command got wind of the negotiations they invaded and annexed Hungary, bringing their murderous campaign of anti-Semitism with them.“Literally, within two or three months the whole Jewish population was practically wiped out,” Ivor says.“Everything was very gradual, and everything that happened gradually, you would say: ‘Well, we can manage, it’s not too bad,’ until it was too late to do anything about it.”Ivor remembers the Nazis telling them they would be put on trains and transported east, where there was farmland waiting for them to live and be free of anti-Semitism.In reality, the trains went straight to Auschwitz.Ivor and his family, along with hundreds of other Jews, were crammed into cattle trucks for the long journey to the camp.Without food, water, or adequate ventilation many didn’t live to see the doors open at the other end.After three nightmarish days, the train pulled to a halt. Ivor could see inmates in striped unorms through the slats of the cattle truck shouting at the new arrivals in Yiddish.He heard them yell: “Eat all the food! Don’t save any food! Children, who are asked, must say they are at least sixteen years or older!”It was advice that would save his le.Ivor had arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest of a number of sub-camps that comprised the Auschwitz complex.More than .million people lost their lives inside its barbed wire fences.Stripped of their belongings, then shaved, Jews and other persecuted groups were sent straight to the gas chambers on arrival.After all had perished, the SS guards forced other Jewish prisoners to clear the bodies from the chambers and move them to the crematorium to be burned — Ivor’s elder brother was one of the tragic inmates forced to carry out this gruesome task.“I don’t know what happened to him, but none of those people survived more than four weeks. After four weeks they rotated them, and they themselves were burned,” Ivor says.As well as extermination, Auschwitz was used as a holding camp for those deemed healthy and old enough to be sent to the Nazi’s network of slave labour camps inside Germany.Selection took place on arrival, often overseen by head camp doctor Josef Mengele.Mengele’s sickening legacy has earned him the macabre moniker ‘the Angel of Death’.A former SS captain, he was sent to Auschwitz in  by Hitler’s second in command, Heinrich Himmler.As head camp doctor, Mengele oversaw a program of barbaric and inhumane medical experiments, often on children, in particular twins, by which he hoped to prove the Nazi’s crackpot theory of Aryan racial dominance.Ironically, it was Ivor’s strictly religious Jewish upbringing, and subsequent understanding of Yiddish, that saved his le.Standing face-to-face with Mengele, the words of the Jewish prisoners fresh in his mind, -year-old Ivor lied, telling Mengele he was sixteen.“If I hadnt known Yiddish, I wouldn’t have known what he meant. So when he asked me, ‘How old are you  I would’ve said .He would never have let me liveI had said I was .”Instead, Ivor was sent to Birkenau’s labour camp, along with his brother Alec.His mother and seven of his sisters were sent straight to the gas chambers.Remembering the Nazi’s cruelty, Ivor still cant believe how callous they were when confronted with human suffering.“My youngest sister was herded into a gas chamber and into a fire, he says. Even now, I think: How could people do that ”After the selection process, Ivor and his brother were marched to the camp’s barracks where they were met by a kapo — a prisoner, usually a German criminal, who supervised the camp’s slave labour workforce.He told them: “You have arrived at a place called Auschwitz, dont you forget it. You’re being given a number now.You do not exist without this number. Forget this number and you will not live.”To prove his point, two other kapos then brought a prisoner into the barracks and held him spreadeagled on the ground in front of the new arrivals.As the prisoner was ‘punished’ he told them: “This is what’s going to happen to you anytime you do something you’re not supposed to.”Suddenly Ivor began to cry.Le in the Nazi work camps was brutal and often short. Back-breaking slave labour, lack of food and horric camp conditions killed many thousands of prisoners.Ivor says the desperate struggle for survival dehumanised him — which is exactly what the camps were designed to do.“You didnt have any clothes, you didnt have any food, you didnt have anything so anything you could get hold of you grabbed.So,you went to bed with someone and the person died next to you the first thing you kept on saying is: ‘Can I use their clothes ’“How you knew that someone had died next to you, you could see the fleas flying away from the body, then you realise the person next to you is dead.“I feel ashamed of what humanity can do, and scared,people don’t take notice, what they can do again.”In Early , German defeat was in sight. Soviet troops were bearing down on the camp from the east while Allied forces fought their way across Germany from the west.Hoping to conceal the horror of their crimes from the eyes of the world, the Nazis moved the prisoners, abandoning Auschwitz as they attempted to destroy evidence of the camp.Prisoners were taken to Allach, a work camp in the heart of Germany, then on to Dachau — the first of many concentration camps built by the Nazis during World War Two.Ivor recalls the sickening scenes that prisoners arrived to at both camps.“The first thing that greeted you when you went to another camp was the amount of wheelbarrows with dead people on them. In other words, death was always in front of you.”In Spring of  after a year in the Nazi’s clutches, Ivor and his brother were liberated by American troops.They were taken to a displaced persons camp where it was confirmed that, out of their entire family, they were the only two left alive.In November  the two brothers came to Britain, where Ivor met his future we, Rhoda.It was here that his sadistic legacy was cemented as he gleefully volunteered to run the selection process - where new arrivals were sent into slavery or straight to the gas chambers.Most Auschwitz doctors found the selection process unpleasant - but Mengele smiled and whistled a happy tune as he sent millions to their deaths.Mengele was partly interested in running the horric selection process so he could find subjects for his notorious medical experiments, looking especially for young twins.His cruel experiments disregarded the safety or wellbeing of their participants - who he made call him Uncle Mengele.Twins would have limbs unnecessarily amputated, have forced blood transfusions with each other, and had chemicals injected into their eyes so they would change colour.Mengele also sewed two Romani twins together in a bid to make them conjoined - both children died from rotting flesh after days in agony.Its unclear how many children he killed, but in just one night Mengele is known to have killed  twins by injecting chloroform into their hearts.After the war, he fled to Brazil where he lived the rest of his le in hiding.He died in  when he had a stroke and drowned while swimming in the sea - he was buried under a  name, but DNA testing on his exhumed remains confirmed his identity in .Together they have four children.Seventy-five years since Auschwitzs liberation and his ordeal there, Ivor is adamant the best antidote to hate is love.“I can genuinely say that, in human nature, in le, in marriage, in everything, love will get you a lot further and a lot better results than hatred.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.I UNDERSTAND that Boris Johnson is keen to amalgamate the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office this year.His experience as Foreign Secretary has left him convinced that you need to align the two departments.The UK will, though, remain committed to spending . per cent of national income on foreign aid.In preparation for this beefed-up role for the Foreign Office, I’m told Rob Oxley – the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary – is heading there to work for Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary.Oxley was with Boris and Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign before working with them in Downing Street.He is a trusted member of their team and his presence in the Foreign Office will ensure smooth relations between Downing Street and the FCO.He is also across the international issues, having previously been a special adviser at both the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses. They laugh at us when we try to be modern but lap up our Rolls-Royces and our Bentleys which are made, by Germans, to feel as old-fashioned as the Queen’s underwear drawer.We send a young, fresh band to the Eurovision Song Contest and it comes last. Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off.

But what made it became so huge was ill-informed eco thinking.In recent years, Australians have faced huge finesthey cut down a tree or even collect fallen branches.This means that when a fire starts, it has a ton of dry wood to get its teeth into.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.A pair of British teachers who have been working in Wuhan say they have not left their apartment for five days, that all transport has been stopped and there is no place to go and so we are pretty much stuck.An outbreak of the virus is understood to have started at an open air fish market in the Chinese city of Wuhan - which has since been put in lockdown after  people died and more than  people were infected globally.A new study published in the China Science Bulletin this week claimed that the new coronavirus shared a strain of virus found in bats.Previous deadly outbreaks of SARS and Ebola were also believed to have originated in the flying mammal.Experts had thought the new virus wasnt capable of causing an epidemic as serious as those outbreaks because its genes were dferent.But this latest research appeared to prove otherwise - as scientists scrabble to produce a vaccine.In a statement, the researchers said: “The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate.Meanwhile, scientists at Peking University also claim that the deadly virus was passed to humans from bats - but say it was through a mutation in snakes.The researchers said that the new strain is made up of a combination of one that affects bats and another unknown coronavirus.They believe that combined genetic material from both bats and this unknown strain picked up a protein that allows viruses bind to certain host cells - including those of humans.After analysing the genes of the strains the team found that snakes were susceptible to the most similar version of the coronavirus.It meant that they likely provided a reservoir for the viral strain to grow stronger and replicate.Snakes are sold at the Huanan Seafood Market in central Wuhan and may have jumped to other animals before passing to humans, they claim.But a senior researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who asked not to be named, said the findings should be treated with caution.He told the South China Morning Post: “It is based on calculation by a computer model.“Whether it will match what happens in real le is inconclusive.“The binding protein is important, but it is just one of the many things under investigation. There may be other proteins involved.”The expert believes that the new strain was an RNA virus, meaning that its mutation speed was  times faster than that of a DNA virus such as smallpox.Jason Neal and Sophie Hunt told BBC Breakfast there has been no reassurance from the British authorities whom they have struggled to contact, possibly because of the time dference and them being closed over the weekend.They have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a ghost town.Mr Neal said: Eventhe news is just to sit tight and nothing is going to change - I think it is just the silence that is disconcerting.We have not heard anything from outside of Wuhan for a week now.He said there is a support group for people who may need help and to get masks and some volunteers are going out to make deliveries.Ms Hunt said emailing and trying to ring the authorities has brought a useless automated response back from the embassy saying not to go to the area.She feels the Chinese authorities have made the right decision by shutting down the city, adding: All we keep hearing is that the death toll is accelerating every day. All we can do really is sit tight and wait for more news.Although it is hard us being stuck here, we know that it is the safest possible option for us at the moment.Home Secretary Priti Patel said the Government was looking at all options to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports that officials have been asked to examine the logistics for an airlt from the city.One academic toldhis best guess was that , people had been infected with the flu-like virus.Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told the paper: There are very large numbers of Chinese tourists across Europe right now.Unless the Chinese manage to control this, and Im sceptical about whether that is possible, we will get cases here.It comes as spectators celebrated Chinese New Year in central London, which marks the start of the Year of the Rat.Authorities in China have cancelled a host of events marking New Year as they expand their measures against the virus.Meanwhile, health officials are continuing to track down around , people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan, the area of China worst affected by the outbreak.The DoH confirmed it is trying to find as many passengers as we can who arrived from the region in the past two weeks to check on their wellbeing.It is understood Border Force officers have been recruited to help speed up the search for passengers as testing for the virus continues in the UK.A public health hub has been set up in Heathrow, staffed by a rotating team of seven clinicians working in shts to support patients on arrival.One British man, who had travelled to Wuhan to visit his girlfriend, is stuck in the city after hisflight on February  was cancelled, and he described trying to get out of the area as impossible.The -year-old, who did not want to be named, told the PA news agency: There is no news on when the airport will reopen therefore the airlinehave just cancelled the flight.Ive also had no help from the UK Embassy in Beijing who are conveniently closed for the weekend.Prof Whitty said following a meeting of the Governments Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall on Friday that the virus looked a lot less dangerous than contracting Ebola, the recent coronavirus, Mers and probably less dangerous than Sars virus.But he added: What we dont know is how far its going to spread, that really is something we need to plan for all eventualities.We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage.We think theres a fair chance we may get some cases over time.Of course this depends on whether this continues for a long time, or whether this turns out to be something which is brought under control relatively quickly.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I fell in love with you, Bryant wrote of basketball in a poem in .When the youngster was six, his dad, then retired from the NBA, was offered the chance to play in Italy and the family moved there, living in Rieti and, later, Reggio Emilia.This charming, small town would capture the young Bryants heart.Kobe Bryant grew up here and was, for all of us, a ‘Reggiano,’” the mayor of Reggio Emilia, Luca Vecchi, wrote on Facebook, following yesterdays tragedy in Calabasas.“Today he left us - a basketball legend that the whole town will remember forever with affection and respect.”Despite also taking up football, Bryant - who learned to speak Italian fluently during his time overseas - remained in love with basketball and wouldto America during the summers to compete.And when his family later moved back to Philadelphia, he stunned on the court at Lower Merion High School, becoming a national star before jumping straight to the NBA Draft aged just .This was a brave move: instead of developing his game at NCAAlevel, Bryant believed in himself and his ability enough to skip college.And it would prove to be a rewarding choice.Aged , Bryant - who had no qualms about challenging his veteran teammates despite his age - became the youngest NBA starter ever .The player would go on to win a string of NBA championships, an MVP and  All-Star selections - while showing admirable loyalty to the team he adored so much as a child.In a sport where players are regularly traded - or opt to enter free agency to earn a few extra million dollars - he stuck around at the Lakers for his entire -year career.Bryant, nicknamed Black Mamba, also displayed an amazing work ethic, even refusing to leave the court after tearing his Achilles heel during a  game so he could take two free throws.I remember one thing he said: If you want to be great at it, or want to be one of the greats, youve got to put the work in, fellow Lakers legend LeBron James told reporters.Alongside Shaquille ONeal, Bryant helped the Lakers win three NBA championships in a row between  and  - a feat that has not been matched since. He became a global icon - including in China, where basketball rivals football as the most popular sport.But alongside Bryants success came scandal: in , he was fined ,after he was caught on camera using a homophobic slur against the referee during an NBA game.Footage showed him apparently mouthing the word fa****. He later apologised for his remark, saying he made it out of frustration in the heat of the game, the BBC reported.The NBA deemed Bryants comment offensive and inexcusable - yet just two years later, the star was widely praised for hitting out at a fan for using the term gay as an insult.Just letting you know... that using your gay as a way to put someone down aint ok! #notcool delete that out ur vocab, Bryant tweeted to the fan at the time.Before leaving school to join the NBA, Bryant took RB singer Brandy to senior prom. He reportedly treated her like a queen and even flew her mum out with her.But it was at age  that he met the love of his le Vanessa, then a -year-old backing dancer in a Tha Eastsidaz music video, while working on his own album that was never released.After Bryant asked Vanessa for her number, they enjoyed a whirlwind romance - getting engaged in May , just six months after they met and while Vanessa was still in secondary school.The following year, in April , they tied the knot at a Catholic church in Calornia. However, much of Bryants family refused to attend because they disapproved of the match.Despite his relatives fears, the couple stayed together until Bryants death - with the NBA star praising Vanessa as his love and best friend in an Instagram post on their anniversary.But he also admitted they had faced ups and downs during their romance.In , Bryant was accused of sexual assault by a -year-old hotel worker in Colorado.He admitted cheating on his we, but denied the attack, claiming the sex was consensual.Prosecutors later dropped the charges against Bryant after the accuser refused to testy - and he reportedly gted Vanessa a millioneight-carat purple diamond ring as an apology.Speaking through tears at a press conference, he told his then-we of two years: Youre my backbone. Youre a blessing. Youre a piece of my heart. Youre the air I breathe.Despite being dropped by big sponsors, Bryant managed to revive his reputation and his marriage.Yet in , he was linked to playboy model Jessica Burciaga and Keeping Up With The Kardashians producer Carla DiBello - who both denied affairs with the player.The same year, Vanessa filed for orce, citing irreconcilable dferences amid her husbands alleged serial infidelity. However, this was called off two years later.Last June, the couple of nearly  years welcomed little Capri, their fourth daughter after -year-old Natalia, Gianna and three-year-old Bianka.They had heartbreakingly suffered a miscarriage in , a year before Giannas birth.During his illustrious career, Bryant, who retired in  and was worth  million , also made his mark in the business world, setting up the sports brand Kobe Inc.He told Forbes at the time that he wanted the company to own and grow brands and ideas that challenge and redefine the sports industry while inspiring the world.And inspire the globe he did.Since Bryants death, tributes have poured in from the sports and celebrity worlds and the public alike, with NBA commissioner Adam Silver saying the organisation was devastated.He will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability, he said in a statement.Bryant - who also wrote a series of kids books and won an Oscar for his short film Dear Basketball - had passed down his lasting love of the game to daughter Gianna.Kobe [was] an amazing dad who loved his family deeply - and took great pride in his daughters love for the game of basketball, said legend Michael Jordan.Retiree Bryant had hoped that Gianna would carry on his legacy.Sadly, she now wont be able to do so, but the pairs legacies will undoubtedly live on through their achievements and the tight-knit family they leave behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has also given paid employment to that man with the megaphone outside Parliament, to sellers of flags, and to YouTubing oddballs who would otherwise have to prank-call the police for attention. A brief look out of the window may not reveal a single change since the date of the referendum on June , . There are no fresh mass graves, no armed civilian militia, nor the toilet roll shortage we were told would arrive at the same time as chronic diarrhoea from unpuried drinking water. But then, Brexit has not happened yet. Nor will it happen at pm this Friday. All that will occur on that date is the equivalent of Harry and Meghan boarding a plane to Toronto - a decision has been made, then confirmed by a smaller number of people, and now the real headache begins.It is not possible, though, for nothing to happen for , days. Some things have changed already, permanently, and mostly for the better. For example: . Every pub contains a constitutional expert  It is no longer possible to state loudly, and in public, an opinion about the legally-binding nature of international treaties, the sovereignty of Parliament, or the validity of a Supreme Court decision, without at least  person, possibly , expressing an alternative view while quoting -year-old case law to back it up.Should you wish to have a debate about whether the role of Members of Parliament is to be representatives or delegates, the best place to do it is now the Royal Oak, or perhaps the work canteen. It used to be that the separation of powers was of concern only to those few who walked along their corridors. Now, this mutually-abusive ménage à trois between the executive, legislative and judiciary has been examined, argued with, and considered by millions who used to be blissfully ignorant of it.So theyaposll all appreciate the next point, which is: . The Prime Minister is not Henry VIII When Theresa May first tried to trigger Article  - months after the referendum, which was won by the side that promised it would not do it for  YEARS - she did so using her powers under the Royal Prerogative. Several people raised their eyebrows about the ancient right of the sovereign being used to arbitrarily leave an international treaty in a way no-one had voted for, and one in particular led a campaign to ensure Theresa stay in her democratic lane.Gina Miller was subject to death threats, intense abuse, and flat lies from a government made to look foolish. Others who supported her cases were not. But her court actions ensured our unwritten constitution was safeguarded, Theresa was told she was not allowed to be a tyrant, and an argument about Royal power which we all thought ended when Charles I had his head lopped off was settled for a second time in a far less bloody fashion.A win for Brexiters, Remainers, Roundheads and Cavaliers. And so is the fact that: . Nigel Farage is unemployed  After  years on the EU gravy train, one limited company, two political parties and an untold number of resignations, the yellow-trousered tit has lost his purpose.A one-man generator of the dole queue, he has likewise removed  Brexit Party MEPs, and  of other parties, from the European Parliament, and dumped financial responsibility for them on others. Heaposs considered by the current government not a fit and proper person for the House of Lords, and during the referendum proved electoral kryptonite by squashing the prospective Leave vote every time he appeared in public. Nigel has vowed not to take his EU severance pay and pension, but then he does have a nice berth on LBC, regular spots on Fox News, and a friend in the White House. The delicious question, though, is how long any of that will last after Nigelaposs lost his point. Because: . This is Boris Johnsonaposs problem, now  Brexit is Borisapos baby. It happened only because he aligned himself to it, resigned from the first government committed to it, then blithely promised all sorts of unicorns to become PM.He has proven himself able to get elected while being widely disbelieved, but having already experienced Commons defeats despite a walloping majority it is unclear what will happenthe Brexit he promised - a healthier NHS, friendlier EU, and actual jam on your carefully-protected rights - does not materialise. Heaposll probably blame someone , talk about having to be practical and end up signing off on a deal worse than the last one. Oh, wait, heaposs done that already. Well, perhaps heaposll get Carrie pregnant and hope no-one asks him whether this is number  or . And his biggest problem has gone, as: . Northern Ireland will probably be fine  Fears of a renewed barbed-wire border, of border guards intimidated, bribed, beaten or murdered, of the Army deployed once more to keep order, and fresh terrorist bombing campaigns have been allayed.Thataposs because the Good Friday Agreement, which allowed Northern Irish citizens to live in peace and self-identy as British or Irish, has been effectively replaced by a Withdrawal Agreement which says in not so many words that theyaposre all Irish now.Thereaposs no border. No requirement for number plate recognition cameras to bend space and time, or border guards to illegally spy on what lorries in other countries are up to. And thereaposs no need for the IRA to get its knickers in a twist. The Loyalist terror groups might, but so what because: . Jeremy Corbyn might have finally won something  For decades as a trouble-making backbencher, Corbyn campaigned for a united Ireland. He voted against the  Anglo-Irish agreement, called for independence and reconciliation, and as leader of the Labour Party his spokesman said he thought reunication had majority support.It didnapost, when he said that. But since then two polls have found Northern Ireland is slightly in favour of rejoining the Republic from which it split in . The problem with an invisible border is that the bleedinapos obvious one in the Irish Sea would become more of an issue."},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer says mother laws","story":"w.mantis  Keir Starmer has said his mother-in-lawaposs condition is still awful in his first comments since she suffered a serious accident last week.  n The Labour leadership frontrunner ed to the campaign this morning after four days off in what he called a very, very dficult time for his family. nHe also thanked incredible NHS workers as well as Labour colleagues who had shown incredible kindness and support.  nSir Keir missed two all-candidate events, a hustings and a Unite interview, due to the family crisis while another hustings was cancelled out of respect to him.  nTonight he will give a speech vowing a radical rewrite of the UK constitution to create a federal nation, before embarking on a three-day tour of Scotland, Northern England and Wales.  n  n   n Labour leadership: Keir Starmer vows radical shake-up of constitution to move power from London n Poll finds next Labour leader must move on from Jeremy Corbyn era to win power   nThe details of the accident have not been disclosed but Sir Keir said he and his weaposs family had been in and out of intensive care for four days and nights so far.  nAsked for an update by Sky Newsapos Kay Burley, he said: She’s awful, I’m afraid.  nShe’s still in intensive care and it’s been very very hard for my we and her family.

And he hit back at an intervieweraposs question on whether it was racist to say there are too many foreigners in Britain. He told BBC Radio  Liveaposs Nicky Campbell: Can I just say how uncomfortable I am about that just at the moment. Weaposve just spent four days in intensive care with my mother-in-law where there are people of every nationality giving her the most incredible care. And therefore pitching this debate in that way I think is... just got to be very very careful. Sir Keir missed two all-candidate events, a hustings and a Unite interview, due to the family crisis while another hustings was cancelled out of respect to him. Tonight he will give a speech vowing a radical rewrite of the UK constitution to create a federal nation, before embarking on a three-day tour of Scotland, Northern England and Wales. The details of the accident have not been disclosed but Sir Keir said he and his weaposs family had been in and out of intensive care for four days and nights so far. Asked for an update by Sky Newsapos Kay Burley, he said: She’s awful, I’m afraid. She’s still in intensive care and it’s been very very hard for my we and her family. So a very very dficult few days for us. Sir Keir said it had been a very bad accident. Asked for her prognosis he replied: It’s very dficult, very very dficult.  The NHS are absolutely brilliant in what they’re doing and we want to just thank them for everything they’re doing. In histo the campaign trail today, Keir Starmer has vowed a radical shake-up of the UKaposs constitution to move power out of London.The bookiesapos favourite for Labour leader will pledge to end the monopoly of power in Westminster.Calling for the UK to move to a federal system, he will say: The status quo is not working.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTroubled Tory MPs fretting he’s Superflop, not Superman, would concern a Prime Minister less arrogant than Boris Johnson. Increasing murmurings on Westminster’s Tory benches about drt and lack of direction betray a creeping nervousness in party ranks – only a month after winning a thumping Parliamentary majority. Friday’s orchestrated celebrations of a Brexit not yet done and Britain remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union during ’s dangerous £billion trade talks will distract momentarily from the growing unease but prove no permanent ersion. Wiser Tory heads worry that Johnson thinks Downing Street is a grander version of London’s City Hall, where as Mayor he spent his time posing for photographs and squandering public money on vanity buses and an unbuilt garden bridge, stealing other people’s credit for the London  Olympics. Older Tory heads compare – unfavourably – Johnson’s early weeks, including a fortnight’s holiday in Mustique, to the Labour bundle of energy that was Tony Blair here, there and everywhere on his  debut. Early impressions count. HS, Huawei, climate emergencies and Whitehall upheaval are splitting a party incapable of remaining united outside election time. Include a slouching economy, an ailing NHS given a plaster instead of the required transfusion and another round of school cuts... and the bleak picture that emerges is nothing like the pretty fiction Johnson painted in December.  Add a dash of resentment over posh weirdo misfit adviser Dominic Cummings’ Mafioso act and the mix is political Kryptonite. This Clark Kent with thinning hair isn’t the character he sold to the electorate. Folk in seats such as Sedgefield, Stoke, Redcar, Grimsby and West Brom are entitled to feel short-changed.

The fast food giant said it had taken the measure after a member of staff was attacked at a branch in Chelmsley Wood in Solihull. Employees there are safeguarded by rows of metal, reportedly to stop intruders getting behind the counter, Birmingham Live reports. There are gaps big enough for a family chicken bucket to pass - but is small enough to protect staff from any potential threat. The fixtures - secured by chunky metal bars bolted from the counter to the ceilings - were introduced after fighting and an incident involving a worker, Birmingham Live was told. A girl reportedly jumped over the counter and struck a staff member in the kitchen, a manager at the branch said.Tell us about your terrible experiences in takeaways - email webnews@mirrorOne customer visiting the store on Sunday said: Iaposm not surprised theyaposve resorted to this. Itaposs moody as anything. Iaposll only come in the daytime as it is all gangs of teenagers come the evenings, its like they have nothing better to do. Its always kicking off around here. It looks like chicken wire, which is ironic. Itaposs unsightly too, its has an airport security feel about it. Another customer, Joanne Marshall, , a college student, said: I donapost feel unsafe here as thereaposs security staff here but its a bit unnerving to see security barriers at a KFC. Itaposs a sign of the times I suppose.  When asked about the security measures at the branch, one staff member said: Weaposve had a few problems with fights so its for our safety. One of our girls was attacked, people have jumped over the counter before. Itaposs fine most of the time but weaposve had a few issues, shall we say. Other residents reacted on social media with Graham Bassett saying: We are now living in a violent society were there is no respect for anything and any body. Debbie Riley put on Facebook: Donapost blame them I saw a really nasty situation safety for the staff. Shakil Mohammed added: So kfc is serving chicken through chicken wire.  Dan Moore said: Itaposs the roughest KFC in and around Brum without doubt. Seen loads of trouble in there. A spokeswoman for KFC said: Something happened a few months ago.Itaposs for our safety, a few months ago a girl jumped over and hit one of the staff members. So they just put it up for safety. It was put up in August. When quizzed over the fixture, another staff member added: Itaposs for our safety because of the fights. Thereaposs been fights happening yeah. Several Midland fast-food restaurants have taken extra security measures to protect staff and customers from yobs in recent years. In , Birmingham Live told how rival McDonaldaposs and KFC branches in Park Street, Walsall town centre, had put bouncers on the door.

David Marland lives just five minutes from a live animal and seafood market in Wuhan where it is believed the SARS-like virus was passed to humans. The -year-old walks through the market nearly every day and at least one person living in his apartment block in the Chinese city has tested positive for the flu-like illness. Mr Marland said he rang NHS  for advice after landing at Gatwick Airport last week and expected to be called in immediately for a test, but he was onlyhe had the snfles. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. After Mr Marland told the call taker that he didnapost have the snfles, he was instructed to call backhe started feeling unwell. Mr Marland, a mathematics teacher who has lived in Wuhan for a decade, fears he was given the wrong advice. His family has asked him to stay away because they fear he could be carrying the virus, which has killed more than  people in China and infected more than , others. It has since emerged that the virus is infectious in its incubation period.  Carriers can spread the disease for up to two weeks before symptoms show, according to Chinese officials. Mr Marland, of West Wycombe, Bucks, told the : Iaposm potentially a risk to other people. Iaposm still within the two-week period so I could be spreading the disease everywhere without having any symptoms. I live five minutes from the Wuhan fish market. Itaposs not a nice place, full of chickens and dead hedgehogs.  He said no-one in Britain had advised him to stay at home or stay away from others. Referring to his call to NHS , Mr Marland said: It was like they were just ticking boxes. It feels like they are leaving the door open to this thing. The Brit, who teachers at the Wuhan China Britain School, ed to Britain on January  after travelling from Wuhan to Gatwick through Shenzhen and Hong Kong. A top health chief warned on Monday that coronavirus is likely already in Britain. Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle told Sky News she suspects there are already cases of coronavirus in the UK. She says the country is well-prepared to handle cases here. The risk to the British public remains low, according to health chiefs. Officials are trying to track down about , people who have recently flown to the UK from Wuhan.

A respiratory disease, coronavirus has already spread out of the China with cases now identied in Thailand and the US. Health bosses in the UK have already warned that itaposs more than likely there are already cases of the infection in Britain as more than  people have been tested so far. Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said there was a fair chance cases would emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to about ,. The Department of Health insists the risk to people on the UK remains low but stress that the situation is being monitored closely by the government. In China, at least  cities - and million people - have already been put in lockdown in a bid to stop the spread of the illness. The first was Wuhan, which is where coronavirus is thought to have originated, and major tourist attractions have been closed to visitors. Among these are Shanghai Disneyland and authorities are working round the clock to build new hospitals to treat the sick. A new ,-bed hospital is due to open on Febraury . Huge holiday events for Chinese New Year have also been cancelled, including a celebration in Bejing, which normally attracts huge crowds. Transport in and out of some of the affected areas in China has already been closed off and the government is advising Brits against travelling to others. Arrangements are also being made to bring UK nationals in the affected areas back to the UK. Other countries are also making arrangements to bring people home. A British teacher who lives in the centre of the outbreak has claimed he wasnapost tested for coronavirus when he ed to Britain last week. David Marland lives just five minutes from a live animal and seafood market in Wuhan where it is believed the SARS-like virus was passed to humans. Experts from the World Health Organsation have also warned that the number of infected people could double every six days. Coronavirus, unlike other deadly epidemics SARS and Ebola, can be spread before the person infected is showing any symptoms, making it harder to contain. It means people with coronavirus may be unaware they are infected as they go about their daily routine. Chinaaposs health minister Ma Xiaowei made the announcement yesterday.

But for them, daily le isn’t about personal suffering, it’s about warning as many young people as possible about the pitiless depths humanity can sink. It’s about warning how even a liberal European country like Germany can go from modern democracy to murderous dictatorship in a matter of months. It’s about showing how ordinary people, yes, just like you and me, can take part in genocide their thousands and look away in their millions. That’s why today is so important to every survivor – and everyone. After six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during the Second World War the world said ‘never again’. Yet ever since it’s been ‘again and again’. Unspeakable horror follows unspeakable horror. German philosopher Georg Hegel knew it  years before Hitler when he said: “We learn from history that we do not learn from history.” Millions of innocents have been killed in CambodiaRwanda , Bosniaand Darfur, the first genocide of the st century, where , have died. Today the Rohingya are being killed in Myanmar, the Nuer in South Sudan, Yazidis in Syria and Iraq and more than one million Uighur Muslims are currently imprisoned in China. It happened then, it’s happened since and it’s happening now.  We live in fragile times, in an era not unlike the s, with rising nationalism across Europe, hot heads in the Kremlin and White House, politicians peddling hate and jihadists determined to start another Holy War. Here in the UK, at least, the legacy of Holocaust survivors’ seems secure. The Nazis’ crimes are part of the national curriculum, the Government, through the Holocaust Educational Trust, sends two students from every college in the country to Auschwitz, the Imperial War Museum’s new Second World War and Holocaust galleries, due to open next year, will be an unrivalled resource for teaching about mankind’s darkest hour and a new national memorial and learning centre is to be built next to Parliament. On this landmark anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi death camp where one million of Hitler’s victims were murdered, we of course pay tribute to the dwindling number of survivors.

Karen Matthews, , is engaged to convicted child abuser Paul Saunders, . The paedophile, from Blackbird Leys, Oxford, was jailed five years for abusing a vulnerable girl over a period of three years but is now back walking the streets.Saunders preyed upon his victim when he was working as a driver taking the elderly to hospital and disabled teenagers to college. He admitted engaging in sexual activity with a child, making indecent images of a child and two counts of sexual assault between  and  when his victim was aged between  and .  He is said to be set to wed Matthews, who was jailed in  for faking her daughteraposs abduction in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, in a bid to claim a £, reward. Police and neighbours searched for her daughter, Shannon, for  hours before her twisted plot was foiled. The schoolgirl was found under a bed at the home of the uncle of Matthewsapos then-boyfriend.  Her daughter was removed from her disgraced motheraposs care and has been given a new identity. Matthews was jailed for eight years but was released in  after serving just half of her sentence. Saunders was arrested after police found he was living with Matthews and had breached his bail conditions. He was then released on bail and is said to have made up with Matthews after they had fallen out when his paedophile past emerged.  The pair are believed to have gotten engaged over Christmas, with Matthews snapped flashing her engagement ring while out shopping with him recently. Police were called to the coupleaposs home last week. Officers told neighbours they had been called to reports of a disturbance and askedtheyaposd heard any shouting or noises but left a short time later without making any arrests, according to reports. The location of the property in a town in Englandaposs south cannot be reported. "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons powerful photo portraits","story":"w.mantis  The Duchess of Cambridge has captured the inner strength of Holocaust survivors in photographs to mark the th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.    nShe has made it her mission to help break the cycle of damaged children becoming damaged adults in Britain but in this new photographic project Kate encountered grandparents who had endured the most horric of childhood traumas and come through incredible adversity to live fulfilled lives.  nInspired by the story of Anne Frank and the pictures of th century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, the future Queen, one of several photographers involved in the project, took portraits of two survivors with their children and grandchildren and described them as “two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet”.    nEach of the portraits, which will be published on Monday to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, depicts the special connection between a survivor and younger relatives carrying their legacy. nThey are designed to encourage everyone in Britain to perpetuate and share the memory of the horrors inflicted by the Nazis.  nOne of Kate’s portraits was of -year-old Steven Frank, originally from Amsterdam, who survived multiple concentration camps as a child. nHe is pictured alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie Fleet, aged  and .  n  n   n   nHer other portrait is of -year-old Yvonne Bernstein, originally from Germany, who was a hidden child in France throughout most of the Holocaust.  nShe is pictured with her -year-old granddaughter Chloe Wright.  nKate, , who is patron of the Royal Photographic Society and a keen amateur snapper, said: The harrowing atrocities of the Holocaust, which were caused by the most unthinkable evil, will forever lay heavy in our hearts.  nYet it is so often through the most unimaginable adversity that the most remarkable people flourish.  nDespite unbelievable trauma at the start of their lives, Yvonne Bernstein and Steven Frank are two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet.  nThey look back on their experiences with sadness, but also with gratitude that they were some of the lucky few to make it through.  n  n   nTheir stories will stay with me forever. Whilst I have been lucky enough to meet two of the now very few survivors, I recognise not everyone in the future will be able to hear these stories first hand.  nIt is vital that their memories are preserved and passed on to future generations, so that what they went through will never be forgotten.  nOne of the most moving accounts I read as a young girl was The Diary of Anne Frank, which tells a very personal reflection of le under Nazi occupation from a childaposs perspective. Her sensitive and intimate interpretation of the horrors of the time was one of the underlying inspirations behind the images.  nI wanted to make the portraits deeply personal to Yvonne and Steven - a celebration of family and the le that they have built since they both arrived in Britain in the s.  nThe families brought items of personal signicance with them which are included in the photographs.  nIt was a true honour to have been asked to participate in this project and I hope in some way Yvonne and Stevenaposs memories will be kept alive as they pass the baton to the next generation.  n  nMeghan Markle aposwants to get more involved in politics and has always dreamed of being presidentapos  nKate Middleton keeps George, Charlotte and Louis close to heart with poignant necklace   nThe Duchess, a history of art graduate, said her photographic style in these portraits was inspired by Vermeer, whose domestic interior scenes of middle class le display a signature pearly light and draw the eye into the picture using carefully placed objects.  nHer photo of Yvonne features her German ID card, dated March , , which has a letter ‘J’ for Jew stamped on it. There is also a treasured brooch, bought for Yvonne by her daughter. nIt was made by the jewellery firm founded by her great-grandfather before it was taken over by the Nazis.  nSteven and his granddaughters included particularly poignant items in his portrait by Kate. nThey included a pan which his mother kept with them to cook extra morsels of food throughout their time in the camps, and a tomato from his garden. When Steven was in the  nTheresienstadt camp as a child, he helped another prisoner grow tomatoes.  n“He had picked out the pips from rotten tomatoes and grew his own. I became his little helper, watering these tomatoes,” Steven said. n“He showed me how to pick out the side shoots so they grow straight, then when he was sent off to a camp in Poland, he asked me to look after his plants.  n“I was so proud to be asked - I was only eight years old. Since the war I have grown tomatoes at home in the greenhouse and every time I water them I think of this man. nI don’t even know his name. I still feel  years on that I’m watering his tomato plants for him. When the tomatoes are out now the grandchildren come over and help to pick them.”  nThe portraits will be part of a new exhibition which will open later this year, bringing together  powerful images of survivors and their family members to mark  years since the end of the Holocaust.  n  n   n   n    n   nTwo other portraits, by distinguished photographers Jillian Edelstein and Frederic Aranda, are released today to announce the project - a collaboration between the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, Jewish News, and the Royal Photographic Society. nOther images featuring in the exhibition will be taken by fellows of the Royal Photographic Society.  nIn a photograph by Frederic Aranda, Joan Salter, , who fled the Nazis as a young child, appears with her husband Martin and her daughter Shelley.  nJohn Hajdu, , who survived the Budapest Ghetto, is in a portrait with his four-year-old grandson Zac photographed by Jillian Edelstein.  nTop news stories from nJustin Cohen, news editor and co-publisher of Jewish News, said: “Each of these striking photographs remind us of the strength of so many survivors in building new lives and families after coming face to face with evil, but also of the millions who were murdered and the many more millions of children and grandchildren who were never even born.  n“With fewer and fewer survivors with us to relay their experiences the work of the Duchess and the other photographers will help ensure the truth is never forgotten, and its lessons for fighting hate today are brought to the fore.”  nLater today Kate will be joined by her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, at the UK Holocaust Memorial Day commemorative ceremony in Westminster.  nElsewhere, the Duchess of Cornwall will attend commemorations in Poland to mark the th anniversary of the liberation of former Nazi concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau.  n \",\"published\":\"--T::Z\",\"title\":\"Kate Middletons powerful photo portraits of le affirming Holocaust survivors - \",\"url\":\"www.mirror news uk-news kate-middletons-powerful-photo-portraits-\",\"ratings\":[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Default\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Tesco\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Ian\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Terry\"],\"dbID\":,\"findings\":,\"keywords\":[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"analyzed_text\":\"The Duchess of Cambridge has captured the inner strength of Holocaust survivors in photographs to mark the th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.   nShe has made it her mission to help break the cycle of damaged children becoming damaged adults in Britain but in this new photographic project Kate encountered grandparents who had endured the most horric of childhood traumas and come through incredible adversity to live fulfilled lives. nInspired by the story of Anne Frank and the pictures of th century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, the future Queen, one of several photographers involved in the project, took portraits of two survivors with their children and grandchildren and described them as “two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet”.   nEach of the portraits, which will be published on Monday to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, depicts the special connection between a survivor and younger relatives carrying their legacy.  nThey are designed to encourage everyone in Britain to perpetuate and share the memory of the horrors inflicted by the Nazis. nOne of Kate’s portraits was of -year-old Steven Frank, originally from Amsterdam, who survived multiple concentration camps as a child.  nHe is pictured alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie Fleet, aged  and . nHer other portrait is of -year-old Yvonne Bernstein, originally from Germany, who was a hidden child in France throughout most of the Holocaust. nShe is pictured with her -year-old granddaughter Chloe Wright. nKate, , who is patron of the Royal Photographic Society and a keen amateur snapper, said:  \"The harrowing atrocities of the Holocaust, which were caused by the most unthinkable evil, will forever lay heavy in our hearts. n \"Yet it is so often through the most unimaginable adversity that the most remarkable people flourish. n \"Despite unbelievable trauma at the start of their lives, Yvonne Bernstein and Steven Frank are two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet. n \"They look back on their experiences with sadness, but also with gratitude that they were some of the lucky few to make it through. n \"Their stories will stay with me forever.

Inspired by the story of Anne Frank and the pictures of th century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, the future Queen, one of several photographers involved in the project, took portraits of two survivors with their children and grandchildren and described them as “two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet”.   Each of the portraits, which will be published on Monday to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, depicts the special connection between a survivor and younger relatives carrying their legacy. They are designed to encourage everyone in Britain to perpetuate and share the memory of the horrors inflicted by the Nazis. One of Kate’s portraits was of -year-old Steven Frank, originally from Amsterdam, who survived multiple concentration camps as a child. He is pictured alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie Fleet, aged  and .  Her other portrait is of -year-old Yvonne Bernstein, originally from Germany, who was a hidden child in France throughout most of the Holocaust. She is pictured with her -year-old granddaughter Chloe Wright. Kate, , who is patron of the Royal Photographic Society and a keen amateur snapper, said: The harrowing atrocities of the Holocaust, which were caused by the most unthinkable evil, will forever lay heavy in our hearts. Yet it is so often through the most unimaginable adversity that the most remarkable people flourish. Despite unbelievable trauma at the start of their lives, Yvonne Bernstein and Steven Frank are two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet. They look back on their experiences with sadness, but also with gratitude that they were some of the lucky few to make it through. Their stories will stay with me forever. Whilst I have been lucky enough to meet two of the now very few survivors, I recognise not everyone in the future will be able to hear these stories first hand. It is vital that their memories are preserved and passed on to future generations, so that what they went through will never be forgotten.  One of the most moving accounts I read as a young girl was The Diary of Anne Frank, which tells a very personal reflection of le under Nazi occupation from a childaposs perspective. Her sensitive and intimate interpretation of the horrors of the time was one of the underlying inspirations behind the images. I wanted to make the portraits deeply personal to Yvonne and Steven - a celebration of family and the le that they have built since they both arrived in Britain in the s. The families brought items of personal signicance with them which are included in the photographs. It was a true honour to have been asked to participate in this project and I hope in some way Yvonne and Stevenaposs memories will be kept alive as they pass the baton to the next generation. The Duchess, a history of art graduate, said her photographic style in these portraits was inspired by Vermeer, whose domestic interior scenes of middle class le display a signature pearly light and draw the eye into the picture using carefully placed objects. Her photo of Yvonne features her German ID card, dated March , , which has a letter ‘J’ for Jew stamped on it. There is also a treasured brooch, bought for Yvonne by her daughter. It was made by the jewellery firm founded by her great-grandfather before it was taken over by the Nazis. Steven and his granddaughters included particularly poignant items in his portrait by Kate. They included a pan which his mother kept with them to cook extra morsels of food throughout their time in the camps, and a tomato from his garden. When Steven was in the Theresienstadt camp as a child, he helped another prisoner grow tomatoes. “He had picked out the pips from rotten tomatoes and grew his own. I became his little helper, watering these tomatoes,” Steven said. “He showed me how to pick out the side shoots so they grow straight, then when he was sent off to a camp in Poland, he asked me to look after his plants. “I was so proud to be asked - I was only eight years old. Since the war I have grown tomatoes at home in the greenhouse and every time I water them I think of this man. I don’t even know his name. I still feel  years on that I’m watering his tomato plants for him. When the tomatoes are out now the grandchildren come over and help to pick them.” The portraits will be part of a new exhibition which will open later this year, bringing together  powerful images of survivors and their family members to mark  years since the end of the Holocaust.  Two other portraits, by distinguished photographers Jillian Edelstein and Frederic Aranda, are released today to announce the project - a collaboration between the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, Jewish News, and the Royal Photographic Society. Other images featuring in the exhibition will be taken by fellows of the Royal Photographic Society. In a photograph by Frederic Aranda, Joan Salter, , who fled the Nazis as a young child, appears with her husband Martin and her daughter Shelley. John Hajdu, , who survived the Budapest Ghetto, is in a portrait with his four-year-old grandson Zac photographed by Jillian Edelstein.

He had seemed well all day until late afternoon, when he vomited violently after a feed. His temperature suddenly shot up, his lips turned blue and his mother and aunt were immediately concerned.  nHe was taken to Tameside General Hospital, Manchester, by ambulance where Muna was unable to settle him.  nShe says: “I was becoming alarmed at how distressed he was. He was burning hot, but his feet were freezing, which is a marker for meningitis, but a nurse told me just to wrap them in a blanket.  n“A doctor told me he just had a cold virus, and that he could go home.

He suffered a cardiac arrest and died with Muna at his side.  nMuna says: “When we arrived, one of the nurses from our earlier visit said to me: ‘This is why we should always listen to mothers.  n“I told her: ‘It’s too late.’  n  n Inside Aaron Hernandezaposs cell and three handwritten notes found after his death   n“I knew in my heart that he was drting away.

Muna Aburizeq has described how she pleaded with medics to continue treating her three-month-old Mohammad Aldmour after he suddenly fell ill at home.Last week an inquest heard how she called an ambulance for her little boy but he was later discharged by doctors, despite Muna begging them to admit him. Hours later, he developed a meningitis rash and his panic-stricken mother called a second ambulance and asked them to take him back to hospital.But paramedics spent almost forty minutes at the family home. When he eventually arrived at hospital, his devastated mother told staff: ‘It is too late now.’ One of the nurses who treated Mohammad earlier in the day said: This is why we should always listen to mothers. The little boy went into cardiac arrest and died soon afterwards, with her by his side. Muna, , from Hyde, Greater Manchester, says: “I told the doctors in no uncertain terms that I did not want to take my baby home. I knew he was seriously ill, but they wouldn’t listen. “A mother’s instinct is a very powerful one, andthey had taken notice, Mohammad would still be alive today. “When I called an ambulance a second time, the paramedic seemed far more interested in filling out his paperwork than he was in treating Mohammad. “I told him Mohammad had a rash and blue lips and he actually accused me of being dramatic. “By the time we arrived at hospital, I knew it was too late.  I will never forgive the staff who treated him. My son was just starting out in le, we had so many hopes and dreams for him, but they failed him at the time he needed them the most.  “I look back on those three months of motherhood and they were so perfect, so full of joy. Now, it feels like a dream. “My heart aches to hold my son again, and it gets no easier as time passes.” Mohammad was a longed for and much-loved baby. Muna and her husband Emad had been trying for a baby for  years and she had suffered five miscarriages, before his birth in May . Muna says: “Mohammad was beautul. I adored him, and I was very protective of him. He was my entire world. “He was a contented, happy little baby and aside from some mild reflux he had no health problems.” Muna’s husband was working abroad and she moved with her sister, Fatmeh, a teaching assistant, and her two young daughters. In September , Mohammad had been on his first ‘school run’ to take his cousins to school. He had seemed well all day until late afternoon, when he vomited violently after a feed. His temperature suddenly shot up, his lips turned blue and his mother and aunt were immediately concerned.  He was taken to Tameside General Hospital, Manchester, by ambulance where Muna was unable to settle him. She says: “I was becoming alarmed at how distressed he was. He was burning hot, but his feet were freezing, which is a marker for meningitis, but a nurse told me just to wrap them in a blanket. “A doctor told me he just had a cold virus, and that he could go home. I was very polite, but I said to her: ‘I know my baby and he is not right, and I really don’t want to take him home.’ “I asked her to check his breathing, because it seemed laboured, but she told me he was fine. “I was insistent but the most they would do was keep him for a further two hours. During that time nobody checked on him at all and then we were discharged.  “I felt absolutely helpless. I trusted the doctors, but I felt they weren’t listening to me.” At home Mohammad became increasingly agitated and at am, Muna noticed a rash on her son’s stomach. She called another ambulance and the call was categorised as urgent. But when paramedics arrived, they spent around  minutes in the house and a further  outside the house, before eventually taking the little boy to hospital. Muna says: “It was asI was wasting their time, like they didn’t believe me. I showed them the rash and they said the glass test was inconclusive. “I told them his lips were blue and one paramedic actually said he thought I was ‘dramatic.’ “Outside in the ambulance he insisted on filling in paperwork, repeatedly asking me about my heritage, saying: ‘Are you black African ’ “I was appalled. I had Mohammad on my chest, his eyes were huge and glassy, and he was covered with a rash. I couldn’t believe it was happening. They just refused to see the urgency.” When Mohammad finally reached hospital, he was rushed away by a team of medics who were unable to save him. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died with Muna at his side.  Muna says: “When we arrived, one of the nurses from our earlier visit said to me: ‘This is why we should always listen to mothers. “I told her: ‘It’s too late.’ “I knew in my heart that he was drting away. He opened his eyes one last time as the doctors tried to get anti-biotics into him, and then he died. “I felt such a pain in my heart as he passed away. It felt my whole world went dark. I felt so guilty afterwards, that I should have been able to look after him, as his mother, yet I know I could not have done more.” Mohammad’s family struggled to cope with their loss and Muna, a care worker, suffered a breakdown. At an inquest into Mohammad’s death, held last week at South Manchester Coroner’s Court, a jury concluded there was a ‘gross failure’ by Tameside General Hospital. According to the hospital’s own policy and national guidelines, three from five readings taken from the little boy should have triggered the sepsis pathway.The coroner, Alison Mutch, recorded a conclusion that the baby died of natural causes contributed to by neglect, and the jury unanimously agreed that a number of failings during the first visit to hospital had contributed to Mohammad’s death. Ms Mutch also acknowledged a series of failings by the North West Ambulance Service Crew who took Mohammad back to hospital for his second visit. However she directed the jury to conclude that these failings did not contribute to Muhammad’s death as it was then, in all probability, too late for him to be saved. The hearing heard that the issues raised, in relation to early medical intervention for sepsis patients, are of national importance.

Eventually, I found out I had a clot in my neck and some in my brain as well. “After the stroke, my friends and family came over to the pub immediately and waited for the ambulance with me.  Sarah, of Grimsby, spent six months undergoing rehabilitation and has just ed home where she is trying to come to terms with her new le. Carpets have had to be removed so she can move her wheelchair, and the living room has been taken over by a specialist bed and equipment. Itaposs nice to be home, but I canapost do anything in my own home, Sarah continued. I have carers five times a day and district nurses visit me in the morning to take care of personal needs. We are having to sell our home, I have had to sell my horse that I have only had for three years. I waited  years to have the money to have my own horse.

Getting there was fine, but I couldn’t access a wheelchair taxi on the way home and ended up having to be manually lted into the back of a Land Rover, which just wasn’t good at all”. Dean said: “There are grants available for this kind of thing, but because I’m working, Sarah doesn’t meet the criteria to be eligible for it. That’s why we started the fundraiser, to try and raise the money to get Sarah what she needs. The appeal was set up to raise half of the money they needed and has already smashed that target.

Sources close to the Royal Family say Prince Charles and Prince William have been reaching out to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to say they couldto the UK full-time,they wanted to, without having to resume their official royal duties. Courtiers fear the pressure on Vancouver Island, where the Sussexes are staying, will have a major impact on the couple, The Sunday Times reports. “The palace are very worried about the Sussexes, because they are vulnerable outside the embrace of the family,” a source said. “They are making contingency plans in case the Sussexes suddenly turn round and say: ‘Can we come back under your wing ’”The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have issued a warning over harassment by photographers, who, they say, are permanently camped outside their Vancouver Island home. They said there have been attempts to photograph the Sussexes inside their home using long range lenses. Meghan was photographed while out walking with the coupleaposs infant son, Archie, and her two dogs. Lawyers for the couple claim the photos were taken without her consent and that the photographer was hiding in the bushes and spying on her. This comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided to step back from their senior roles within the Royal Family. Under the terms of the deal agreed by Harry and Meghan, the Sussexes will keep Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate as their British home, but will repay the £.m used to renovate the property.  Royal officials believe that might be a place to protect the couple from media scrutiny. “You could bring them back to Frogmore to look after them. They wouldn’tto royal duties, but they could have a period of rehabilitation and recuperation,” a source said. Other locations where the couple could be brought are Sandringham and the Prince of Walesaposs house in Wales “This is a looking ahead thing. There’s no timeline here. But everybody agrees that this is a fragile couple. Nobody is going to say, no they can’t come back, the source added.

Joe Black, , had previously tried to take his le twice and expressed suicidal thoughts to his GP following an acrimonious break up with his girlfriend so his doctor sent him to the unit for specialist treatment. However psychiatric experts said inpatient admission was not required and that he should work on self care. Just three days later customer care representative Joe was found hanged at his his home in Macclesfield, Cheshire, by two worried work colleagues who went to his flat after he failed to turn in for his sht. At an inquest in the town, Mr Blackaposs mother Clare condemned staff at Macclesfield District Hospital over their assessment of him claiming they turned away her son when he was a broken man. She said: Heaposs a young man seeking help from his GP. He is referred to AE but then told to go back to his GP. Thereaposs a breakdown here and it just feels like itaposs Friday night, no beds and less paperwork. He was a broken man asking for help. What am I going to tell my other two children  Wait a minute you havenapost ticked the right boxes  He came to you and you turned him away. The hearing was told Mr Black had been head boy at school and loved football which he played for  years and was very gted at maths which he later went onto study for a year at Sheffield University. But his mental health deteriorated during a three year relationship with his unnamed girlfriend. He dropped out of university and the relationship broke down at the end of July last year leaving Mr Black isolated after having cut himself off from friends.  In the weeks before his death on August  he had been trying to get on with his le and make a fresh start even joining the gym the day of his death. But he struggled to cope with the rumours that he had beaten his ex-girlfriend and her leaving the flat they shared together. Mrs Black told the hearing: His relationship with his girlfriend broke down and she moved out about a fortnight before Joes death. His studies didnapost work out and there where relationship dficulties and he decided to leave university at the end of first year. His relationship had been something of an up and down one over the years. That was a dficult separation and it hit Joe hard. At the time of his death she still had some of her belongings in the flat something continued to way heavily on Joes mind. Joe always wanted to do what he could to please her and was burning the candle at both ends. Joeaposs relationship started around  and he fell madly in love but think this was the time when his mental health began to deteriorate. His behaviour became challenging between him finishing his A levels and then starting his degree.  After he left college became argumentative some of these arguments arose discussions about needing to maintain a balance between his relationship and looking out for future prospects. I was aware he was on and off anti depressants that would cause his mood to go up and down. Triggers for his moods included abandonment and isolation. There were previous incidents of self harm on two occasions and he thought about ending his le. In June  he took an overdose at university and December , had attempted to drown himself in the bath. After Christmas he seemed to be okay but looking back that was just Joe putting on a brave front. He seemed upbeat and talking aslooking to make a fresh start but there had been an allegation that Joe caused some bruising to her face but Joe didnapost accept that. He had been banned from two nightclubs as she was now with the manager of these establishments. That upset Joe because he felt ashe couldnapost go out in Macclesfield. I think he did what he could to try motivate himself and be positive but sadly wasnapost able to do so.  Days before his death he had told his mother that he did want to get back together with his ex-girlfriend and didnapost want to be without her, but that was thought to be a blip in his behaviour. A statement from Health Assured, a wellbeing company which helped Joe said: On August , it was claimed Joe was suicidal. He said he had no friends and family around and his girlfriend had just walked out on him. He claimed she had made things up, she was trying to self harm and he was trying to stop her. She bit him and he pushed her but she stated he abused her. He has a lack of self confidence and feeling overwhelmed. Joe said he had waves of depression and had these for around six years. Holly Nettle, a registered psychiatric nurse at Macclesfield district general hospital said: Joe had seen his GP and was coming to AE as he was being flagged as someone with suicidal thoughts.

Some called for the NBC news anchor to be sacked after a clip of the broadcast quickly went viral as the world reacted in shock to the death of the basketball great along with his daughter Gianna and seven others. In the clip the reporter appears begins to say what some claimed was aposLos Angeles n*****s,apos then quickly corrects herself, saying aposLos Angeles Lakers.apos The former New Yorker has denied using the racial slur as she apologised for the slip tonight. Alison Morris wrote that she had gone to say Knicks instead of Lakers by mistake, then corrected herself mid-word, saying aposNakers.apos Footage of her on-air stumble was recorded and posted online by swathes of furious viewers, with many demanding that MSNBC fire her and apologise. She wrote on Twitter: Earlier today, while reporting on the tragic news of Kobe Bryant’s passing, I unfortunately stuttered on air, combining the names of the Knicks and the Lakers to say aposNakers.apos  Please know I did not  would NEVER use a racist term. I apologize for the confusion this caused.    Viewers were fiercely ided over whether the anchor had said the aposnapos word or had become tongue-tied and stumbled over the word. Viewers were quick to defend her, pointing out her New York career roots and saying it was possible she had been about to call the aposLakersapos the aposKnicksapos, and had stumbled over the word as she realised her mistake. Footage of the broadcast began going viral shortly after the tragic news of Bryantaposs death, along with his young daughter and seven other people, in a helicopter crash emerged today. All nine aboard the chopper were killed in the tragic incident earlier today in Calabasas, an upscale neighbourhood near Los Angeles. Twitter users swtly accused the reporter of racism and urged the broadcaster to sack her, saying it was too offensive to be regarded as just a slip of the tongue. However not everyone was convinced she said the aposnapos word as Morris quickly became the target of a social media pile-on. Some suggested it was possible she had become tongue-tied during the live segment and said aposnakersapos instead of aposLakers.apos Twitter user @BaeAreaNiko wrote: How do you confuse Lakers with n****s  This is disgusting man....

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA journalist has been suspended by her bosses after she tweeted a story about a rape case involving Kobe Bryant just hours after the basketball legend died in a helicopter crash. Felicia Sonmez, who works for the Washington Post, sent out the tweet after the -year-old was killed alongside his daughter Gianna,  , and seven others in the crash outside of Los Angeles. The national political reporter posted a link to a story from April  which had the headline: ‘Kobe Bryant’s Disturbing Rape Case: The DNA Evidence, the Accuser’s Story, and the Half-Confession.’ The article about the former LA Lakers player was published by news site The Daily Beast. Felicia, who has since deleted the tweet, claims she has received death threats after the link was retweeted hundreds and thousands of times and generated thousands of comments. However in follow-up tweets she defended her actions saying: To the , peoplewho have commented and emailed me with abuse and death threats, please take a moment and read the story - which was written + years ago, and not by me. Any public figure is worth remembering in their totality eventhat public figure is beloved and that totality unsettling. She continued: That folks are responding with rage and threats toward mespeaks volumes about the pressure people come under to stay silent in these cases. She also tweeted: If your response to a news article is to resort to harassment and intimidation of journalists, you might want to consider that your behavior says more about you than the person you’re targeting.  She also included a screenshot of some of the emails sent to her which, according to The Desk, was the reason behind her suspension. The website claims a worker at the Washington Post said: “Her managers don’t care about the Daily Beast tweet. “But there’s a concern that the screen shotmight create some legal issues and could violate Twitter’s terms .”  Feliciaaposs actions infuriated so many people on Twitter that the hashtag #FireFeliciaSonmez was trending.  One person tweeted: What a disgusting post from Washington Post reporter Felicia Sonmez immediately after Kobe Bryant and his daughter’s death. While another said: No place for racism in . This is unacceptable. The man just diedand you search for bad news about him. @feliciasonmez the internet never forgets. The pain his we and other two daughters are experiencing will be unimaginable. Show some goddamn respect to him. He died in a tragic accident, along with his daughter, and THIS is what you decide to publish ! ! said a separate tweet. But Twitter user defended Felicia saying: Why are you gleeful about reporter @feliciasonmez being disciplined for.. reminding people of a story that was much-discussed and -reported at the time  Perhaps this wasn’t the time to mention it. But the allegation was a serious one—and clearly forgotten in the fawning coverage.  Bryant was  when he was accused of raping a -year-old employee at a Colorado hotel in . He vehemently denied the charges which were subsequently dropped when the woman refused to testy. Kobe reportedly settled a civil suit with the alleged victim after admitting his cheated on his we with her.

He couldn’t speak our language. The Russians didn’t know about the camps, the gassing, that we were Jewish. But he looked at us, and knew we were victims.”  n  naposI was sent to Auschwitz on my wedding day - the Nazis even took my ringapos  nTrue horrors of Auschwitz laid bare in harrowing colourised photos   nSoberly, she reflects on the fact the fates of she and her playmate, the diarist Anne Frank, just one month younger, could so easily have swapped.  nAnne and her older sister Margot, who posthumously, became her famous step-sisters when her widowed mother married their widower father, Otto, were instead marched to Bergen-Bn where they died before British troops could free them three months later.  n“If Anne and Margot had not gone on that march, they’d have survived,” she insists, quietly. “We overslept, and that saved our le. Our positions could have changed easily.”  nEva’s family and the Franks met in Amsterdam, where both fled to escape persecution. The girls would play on the street.  n  nEva remembers the day “chatterbox” Anne showed off the diary Otto had given her for her th birthday. “I remember her being so happy,” she smiles. “She liked writing so much, she loved telling stories.”  nSoon afterwards, the Franks went into hiding, and so did Eva’s family, who were eventually betrayed, and transported in May, . The Franks were discovered in September. Both families ended up in Auschwitz, but didn’t meet. Eva’s last memory of Anne is of the bubbly girl brandishing the diary which would, published by her father after the war, make her world-famous.  nEva survived selection for the gas chambers because her mother gave her a wide-brimmed hat to hide her youth. “That was the first miracle,” she says.  nEvery detail of Auschwitz remains crystal clear. “The filth, the dirt, no toilets. If they caught you sitting on a bucket you would be beaten. The indignity,” she recalls, sitting in her incongruously cosy North London flat.  n“The lice. We became covered in scabs and boils. And the starvation,” she says. “The cup of liquid in the morning, the chunk of bread at night.”  nEva describes the growing sense of chaos in December . “We realised the Nazis were nervous,” she says. “A lot of the guards ran away.”  n   n  n  nOne night they announced they’d be leaving on a march, and Birkenau, the women’s sub-camp, was to be burned. It wasn’t, and they were left behind.  n“The camp was deserted, no dogs barking. There was dead silence,” Eva explains. There were around  ­prisoners left in Birkenau, she believes, and the same in the men’s camp.  nEva remembers no other children. The only food was dregs. “There was a small pond and we hacked the ice to get water,” says Eva. Deaths were daily. The memory that terrorised Eva for years was moving bodies. “We had to heap them up. I tried to close their eyelids, but they were frozen,” she says.  nWhen the Soviets arrived she was joyful because she longed for food. “It was too soon to feel any joy of survival,” she says. “They gave us metal bowls of cabbage soup with strong bacon fat. We ate, and ate, and ate.”  n  nThe eating after months of starvation led to tragedy. “In the morning there were dead people,” Eva says. In the men’s camp, she saw Otto Frank. “He looked terrible,” Eva recalls. “He was asking, ‘Have you seen my girls ’”  nTwo weeks later, the Soviets started transporting them to Odessa, now in Ukraine. The troops gave them their unorms for warmth – Eva kept hers for years. And as the women gained weight, they provided bras, she giggles.  n“It made me feel human, like a woman again,” she says. One night, the soldiers struck up music. “They showed me how to dance,” she says. “I began to feel like myself again.”  nIn , she was to be reunited with some of them in Russia. But it was to be many years before she found happiness. Learning her father and brother, Erich and Heinz, had died left her depressed, and she considered suicide.  n  nBut slowly, after Otto came into her mother’s le and they married, and Eva married, she says: “I realised how lucky I was.” The shadow cast by her step-sister’s fame was dficult.  n“I was always introduced as Anne’s step-sister. I thought, ‘I have a name – and I survived’,” she admits. But she grew to accept her legacy.  nEva, who has three daughters and five grandchildren, says: “I thought, ‘I’ve a good le, a husband, children. How can I be jealous of someone who was killed before she was even  ’”  nTop news stories from nBut, she adds, softly: “If the Russians had not arrived just when they did, I would not be sitting here today.”  n  n Eva co-founded the Anne Frank Trust, and gives talks warning about prejudice.

The emaciated -year-old girl could have easily been hallucinating, driven mad by starvation and relentless terror. It was eight months since the Austrian teenager had first arrived in this hell, and days since she and her mother awoke to find their filthy hut almost empty. The Nazis had fled from Soviet troops, taking prisoners with them on death marches that would kill most, to hide evidence of their crimes. They left behind only those souls on the brink of death. Eva and Elfriede should have gone with them, and surely perished. Their exhaustion meant they overslept and got left behind, awaking to “dead silence”.The bear was in fact a scout arriving ahead of the advancing Soviets who,  days later, would free Auschwitz and those clinging to le there. The -year-old, one of the few who was in Auschwitz for its liberation  years ago today, recalls this first moment of hope with a dazzling, lipsticked smile. She says: “We saw a huge creature in fur with icicles hanging from him, who, before it was daylight, looked like a bear. “When it came closer it turned out it was a Russian scout in a big Russian hat. He couldn’t speak our language. The Russians didn’t know about the camps, the gassing, that we were Jewish. But he looked at us, and knew we were victims.” Soberly, she reflects on the fact the fates of she and her playmate, the diarist Anne Frank, just one month younger, could so easily have swapped. Anne and her older sister Margot, who posthumously, became her famous step-sisters when her widowed mother married their widower father, Otto, were instead marched to Bergen-Bn where they died before British troops could free them three months later. “If Anne and Margot had not gone on that march, they’d have survived,” she insists, quietly. “We overslept, and that saved our le. Our positions could have changed easily.” Eva’s family and the Franks met in Amsterdam, where both fled to escape persecution. The girls would play on the street.  Eva remembers the day “chatterbox” Anne showed off the diary Otto had given her for her th birthday. “I remember her being so happy,” she smiles. “She liked writing so much, she loved telling stories.” Soon afterwards, the Franks went into hiding, and so did Eva’s family, who were eventually betrayed, and transported in May, . The Franks were discovered in September. Both families ended up in Auschwitz, but didn’t meet. Eva’s last memory of Anne is of the bubbly girl brandishing the diary which would, published by her father after the war, make her world-famous. Eva survived selection for the gas chambers because her mother gave her a wide-brimmed hat to hide her youth. “That was the first miracle,” she says. Every detail of Auschwitz remains crystal clear. “The filth, the dirt, no toilets. If they caught you sitting on a bucket you would be beaten. The indignity,” she recalls, sitting in her incongruously cosy North London flat. “The lice. We became covered in scabs and boils. And the starvation,” she says. “The cup of liquid in the morning, the chunk of bread at night.” Eva describes the growing sense of chaos in December . “We realised the Nazis were nervous,” she says. “A lot of the guards ran away.”  One night they announced they’d be leaving on a march, and Birkenau, the women’s sub-camp, was to be burned. It wasn’t, and they were left behind. “The camp was deserted, no dogs barking. There was dead silence,” Eva explains. There were around  ­prisoners left in Birkenau, she believes, and the same in the men’s camp. Eva remembers no other children. The only food was dregs. “There was a small pond and we hacked the ice to get water,” says Eva. Deaths were daily. The memory that terrorised Eva for years was moving bodies. “We had to heap them up. I tried to close their eyelids, but they were frozen,” she says. When the Soviets arrived she was joyful because she longed for food. “It was too soon to feel any joy of survival,” she says. “They gave us metal bowls of cabbage soup with strong bacon fat. We ate, and ate, and ate.”  The eating after months of starvation led to tragedy. “In the morning there were dead people,” Eva says. In the men’s camp, she saw Otto Frank. “He looked terrible,” Eva recalls. “He was asking, ‘Have you seen my girls ’” Two weeks later, the Soviets started transporting them to Odessa, now in Ukraine. The troops gave them their unorms for warmth – Eva kept hers for years. And as the women gained weight, they provided bras, she giggles. “It made me feel human, like a woman again,” she says. One night, the soldiers struck up music. “They showed me how to dance,” she says. “I began to feel like myself again.” In , she was to be reunited with some of them in Russia. But it was to be many years before she found happiness. Learning her father and brother, Erich and Heinz, had died left her depressed, and she considered suicide.

Arina, two, somehow cheated death after she was locked in the dirty room and starved for two weeks. Police saved her after raiding the small apartment in Snihurivka, southern Ukraine, which her parents had left in signicant disrepair. Police officer Anna Dmitrieva, who took part in the operation, said: There was a horrible stench in the flat. The girlaposs parents, grandmother and a friend of the family were heavily drunk. The adults and the child were sitting in a room filled with thick cigarette smoke. The flat was filthy. We could not leave the child in such unsanitary and unhealthy conditions.aposapos The parents have been arrested. Arina was rushed to hospital but is now in a stable condition. Her nursery called police after she was absent for several days. We tried to reach the parents by phone but they did notour calls, nursery manager Olga Levshova said. Some other parents who live in the familyaposs apartment block told me they had not seen Arina around for a long time. We started to worry and called the police. And officers eventually forced entry into the family home after no one answered at the door. Oleg Tsurikov, the head of Snihurivka Police Department told: Police officers were hearing voices coming from inside the flat but nobody opened the door.

I think in this league teams can be inconsistent and, probably, Dundee have been like that themselves throughout this season,” he added.“Hopefully, I can come and help that.

However, children will only be in the nursery for  weeks.The term-time service will run  weeks of the year.Aberdeen City Council has said it is committed to delivering flexible models.These include a full-day provision, for example am until pm during term time for five days, or am until pm for two and a half days for  weeks of the year.Other models are a half-day provision, a long morning or afternoon, or a blended provision which could be a combination of council provider and childminder for example.As a result, there may be dferent times available at dferent nurseries, as several options are given.Each nursery will have dferent provisions available, and parents are urged to check what is available for them.Childminders will receive the money for each funded place from the local authority, which will set the rate. vw, px\"  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “As is the case for all providers delivering funded early learning and childcare from August, childminders will receive a sustainable hourly rate per child from their local authority.“Councils are responsible for setting these rates, to reflect local circumstances.“The longstanding legal position is that funded early learning and childcare must be delivered without the payment of fees, meaning it is unlawful for providers to charge parents and carers top-up fees for a child’s statutory early learning and childcare hours.“Families may, of course, choose to purchase additional hours and services from ELC providers.”For more information on the funded provision of ELC, visit bit.ly qoMPWA range of focus groups are also being carried out by Aberdeen City Council at associated school groups , the feeder primary schools for each academy, in order to discuss the upcoming changes.Some have already taken place, however, there are six still to go ahead.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle.

Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for .

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"valuable support offered to argyll businesses","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowScotland#s entrepreneurial spirit is booming in the face of economic and political challenges, with over , private sector businesses currently operating in the country – the highest level since  – . per cent of which are Small and Medium-sized Enterprises .As Scotland#s national business advice service, Business Gateway helps thousands of customers to meet their business goals every year.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

place as soon as possible.Now, a letter has been sent out to village residents highlighting upcoming work in the area.The letter reads: ldquoWe will shortly begin survey work and site investigation activity on railway land in your neighbourhood.ldquoThis work is required to help the design of a new station at East Linton.ldquoOur work will involve detailed survey activities, which may require us to cut back some vegetation.ldquoOur site investigation work also requires us to use drilling equipment to check ground conditions in proposed development sites.ldquoWhere possible, the work will be carried out during the day.ldquoHowever, some of our investigations need to be undertaken on the railway embankment or directly underneath the tracks.ldquoIn order to access these locations, we will need to carry out the work at night while trains are not operating.ldquoDuring this period of work, we will have a small compound located on site to provide facilities for our staff.ldquoThe compound

developing plans for the December  East Coast Main Line timetable, including services for East Linton.Mr Gray was pleased progress was being made but vowed to keep the pressure on to ensure there were no delays.He said: ldquoFollowing the governmentrsquos decision to cut short Abelliorsquos ScotRail franchise, I asked parliamentary questions about progress on delivering East Lintonrsquos new rail

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

The issue ides Scotland, it would break the highly effective UK single market by creating an economic border between Scotland and our vital English market which is twice as important to us as the rest of the world and it would create uncertainty.Scottish business does not need uncertainty, ision or economic pygmyism from the Scottish Government. What it needs is pragmatism, co-operation and stability.A bit less than half of the Scottish electorate seems to want Independence but what does that actually mean  Most of us would like to be in the EU - a good idea in principle but a very bad idea , as it would, it created economic barriers between England and Scotland. A clear majority of us donrsquot want to join the Euro but in time,we re-joined the EU, we would have to.Do we want a Scottish Airforce or a Scottish DVLA  I doubt it. Do we think the cost involved in setting up our own comprehensive bureaucracy is a good thing or a needless expense reducing our ability to pay for schools and hospitals  Would we enjoy being told what to do by politicians in Brussels any more than by those in London When confronted by what Independence means in terms of hard specic realities people donrsquot actually like it very much. Last time the SNP were the exciting challenger now they are the failing incumbent - they would have a dficult selling job.There are, however, additional policy areas where it would be a good thing for Scotland to have more authority. If only the SNP would give up their isive drive for ldquoIndependence and actually engage with the Scottish electorate and the UK Government to build a consensus around a shared vision, so much could be possible.Take for example immigration. If there was a single bad reason why the pro-EU cause was lost it was probably immigration. In parts of England the pace and scale of immigration has been such that local services have struggled to cope and local people feel disadvantaged and displaced. Yet immigration, which brings young dynamic people to join our society, is a good thing. The problem in Scotland is not that we have too many immigrants but that we have too few. Our society is aging and the ratio of dependants to workers will, within a few decades, become dangerously high in terms of being able to afford good quality public services.What , instead of trying to constantly kick sand in the face of the UK Government and bleat that everything it does is an outrage or that Scotland has been ignored, the Scottish Government developed a focused agenda of additional powers - control of immigration being one, control of the railway infrastructure being another - which it would be sensiblewe could manage in Scotland. There is no reason why the powers of the Scottish Parliament could not be increased over time to build a better Britain which Scotland is genuinely comfortable being in. That would be a happier and more prosperous course for all of Scotland and its people.

I know France well, or so I think, and certainly have grasped both history and mood all the more for living here.When I write about two of the three countries mentioned, I do so with the confidence of close contact of stories told and remembered of links forged republic to republic.I do the same with England and Scotland although I havenrsquot set foot in either for years. But I lived and worked in both. I switched listening modes from London to Glasgow as easily as switching TV channels and in Scotland reported on and witnessed a country rapidly evolving, gathering within it a fresh pride, a steely core to rid itself of dependence on Westminster. A desire ndash long before the words were so grotesquely appropriated by the Brexiters ndash to take back control.I lsquogotrsquo it. And I lsquogotrsquo the English too in their casual, arrogant ignorance and lack of interest in anything other than them.I got it having grown up in a country which also was powering towards a new destiny remembering the past but not in thrall to it looking forward to Europe and not back to the chains of an inglorious Empire.So, when I comment, I comment from a little knowledge, from a tapping in to, not just the history, but the spirit.It is why I am constantly surprised by commentators who pronounce on Scotland, on referendums and on the Party, which is the driving force for Independence.Many words are expended on reasons why that should not be, using suspect financial lsquofactsrsquo and endless repetition of half, long negated arguments that research would have knocked down immediately.Some of the arguments against Scotland leaving the Union are well-reasoned and well worth consideration but these too are knocked down by the lamentable chippiness of some who are as blind as the commentators they dismiss.Itrsquos a word blindness activated by what is seen as a malevolent force robbing and battering the Scots from time immemorial. That is not the truth but there is a truth contained within it.What irritates me above all in most of these comment pieces coming from over the Border, is absence, awareness. Absence of any attempt to delve under the demands to seek the almost indefinable ndash the spirit of a people.Any reading of history shows that movements grow slowly until suddenly, like a high tide, they gather and form until the point they are unstoppable.Sometimes though the expected tide doesnrsquot reach its watermark and flops against the bulwarks ndash becalmed, almost shocked at its sudden halt.If not careful, the Independence movement could reach that point and make no mistake, nothing is being spared by the Westminster Opposition to ensure it does.Confidence can be chipped away statistics twisted to enable doubt to take seed groups encouraged to agitate from within with public spats that only increase the nervousness of those unsure and uncertainthey want to leave the familiar.Cynicism in these times is good ndash but not too much. Passion is good ndash but must be controlled. Anger is good ndash but swallow pride and turn it outwards not back into the group.Much is made of Irelandrsquos struggle for independence and its success on the European stage. Some believe a whole nation rose up. In fact, the Easter rising was begun by a handful, ridiculed by Dubliners as they marched to the Four Courts.Captured, they could have gone down as yet another minor episode. But the British made a mistake and murdered them in Kilmainham Gaol, creating heroes and firing up the land.The British always make a mistake because they never understand the soul of a country.Patience."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10946775.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ben-nevis-project-team-celebrating-five-years-work","story":"Pretty daisy-like blooms explode from Ben Nevisrsquos rocky crevices ndash snowy white and with crisp green stems, they bring a burst of le to the rugged mountainside.Clinging to craggy clfs, tucked in hard-to-reach corries and dotted across Ben Nevisrsquos exposed slopes, the mountainrsquos alpine plants are rare and tiny.But while they may look fragile, they are deceptively tough. And, it transpires, a little more prevalent than had previously been thought.A pound. million programme carried out by Nevis Landscape Partnership involving  separate projects on Ben Nevis and the surrounding glen has just reached its conclusion.Over its five-year lespan, it has seen , trees raised from seed by children and planted in Glen Nevis to help to replace trees lost to deer, disease and the elements, and a new accessible path created at the foot of the mountain. It has also seen art, education and community engagement projects which have boosted understanding of the mountainrsquos unique habitat and history.And for the , visitors who every year trek the Benrsquos well-worn km path, loose, broken and lost stones have been replaced ndash making it a far less risky experience.But perhaps the most challenging ndash and revealing ndash project was the one that combined the efforts of  botanists, geologists and mountain guides in a painstaking and sometimes daredevil search for some of the tiniest inhabitants of Britainrsquos tallest peak.The North Face Survey took scientists roped to mountain guides for safety to some of the Benrsquos most challenging corries, gullies and scree-covered slopes, in a ldquoneedle in a haystack search for tiny specks of plant le.Perhaps remarkably for a mountain which has towered over Scottish le for thousands of years, the survey ventured into areas never previously explored by scientists.As well as shedding fresh light on the extent of the mountainrsquos fascinating plant le ndash leading to Scottish Natural Heritage to upgrade conditions from ldquounfavourable to ldquofavourable ndash the survey forged a remarkable appreciation between the climbers, botanists and geologists for the mountain, and helped ensure one of its best-loved gullies would remain accessible to climbers.According to Mike Pescod, a mountain guide and chair of Nevis Landscape Partnership, a key element of the project was to assess whether rare flowers in number four gully were adversely affected by climbers ndash an issue which raised fears that climbing in the area might be curbed to help ensure fragile plantsrsquo survival.ldquoWhen we were introduced to the botanists they alluded to ice axe-wielding climbers who ripped out plants, he recalled. ldquoBut after three years of working together, it was clear we shared a passion and enthusiasm for the place, landscape and the plants.Better still, their labours were rewarded with a series of remarkable results.Before the survey, only around  populations of its target species of alpine plants were thought to survive the harsh conditions of the North Face.However, the survey identied more than , including fresh sites for some of our rarest alpine plants.:The walk: Ben NevisThey include tufted saxrage, with its small, jagged leaves that measure only -mm and tiny white flowers with pale green veins to attract passing butterflies and flies, generally found nestling amid scree and rock clefts. And also exceedingly rare wavy meadow-grass ndash Poa flexuosa ndash classed as ldquovulnerable and found in only a few locations across the country.Perhaps most unexpected, however, was the discovery of two species of plants not previously found on the Ben: alpine saxrage, with deceivingly resilient flowers and more commonly found in Iceland, Greenland and Norway and curved woodrush, a short, grassy herb found on windswept, rocky summits and plateaus.There were flashes of colour found in the harshest and hardest locations: emerald green leaves and deep red catkins of female dwarf willows were discovered nestling amid the granite of Tower Ridge, involving a heart-pumping scramble and rock climb to reach.Alpine ladyrsquos mantle, drooping saxrage and fresh populations of white-flowered Arctic mouse-ear were also recorded ndash unfortunately, some at higher altitudes than expected, hinting at a movement uphill in search of colder climes.As well as noting the plantsrsquo locations, details of their health and size were recorded to provide a baseline for future botanical surveys.Alongside the scale of finding and documenting tiny plants across a vast area, botanists and climbers faced dficult terrain and complex logistical challenges of carrying huge amounts of rope, safety equipment and survey items up and down the mountain each day. Simply reaching dficult spots pushed climbers and their non-climbing colleagues to the limit.ldquoThe botanists had a degree of climbing ability, and were very capable of climbing over slimy, muddy places which climbers think are horrible. But when it comes to rope systems to help access m high clfs, it was beyond what they could to, added Pescod.ldquoClimbers are usually looking for nice, solid rock, but thatrsquos not where these plants grow. There were loose bits of rock and sharp edges, making it all a lot harder.While the survey has ended, he said climbersrsquo new knowledge of the mountainrsquos alpine plants means they now seek them out during outings, snapping images to share with botanists and passing on what they have learned to others.ldquoItrsquos lovely to be able to climb and know what these plants are that Irsquom looking at, he added. ldquoIt elevates your day.Although the botanical survey was one of the most intense of the  projects, the most obvious one for mountain visitors was the extensive repair of km of the Ben Nevis Path, damaged by tens of thousands of walkersrsquo boots.Fixing it involved , volunteer hours and a logistical headache after stone intended for repairs and stored high up the mountain couldnrsquot be moved because of adverse weather.:Police issue advice to climbers following Ben Nevis deathsAlternative granite from a nearby quarry was ruled out because it came from the wrong side of the tectonic plate, meaning stone had to be sourced from quarries  miles away.After , helicopter lts of almost  tonnes of stone, a pound, investment and five years of work, the path was completed last year.As well as improvement and conservation work, the NLP five-year programme included the first excavation of Dun Deardail, a vitried hillfort at the head of the Allt nan Gleannan valley, new paths leading to the rock climbing area of Polldubh Crags and work to improve drainage at the summit.While the  projects, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, have been declared a major success, Pescod has warned a question mark over future financial backing means there is uncertainty over conservation and environmental projects on Ben Nevis and its surrounding glen.ldquoAll the brilliant stuff over five years has tangible results, but the organisation behind it is at risk of collapsing, he said.ldquoWe are losing unbelievable experience and skill in staff because of the funding system.ldquoSo many people want to visit Ben Nevis, but it needs investment to look after it."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  We re heading for a hard Brexit on Friday  but it needn t have been this way","story":"But you could be forgiven for being unaware of this historic occasion, because it only merited a footnote on news bulletins.

Gone, too, the flag-waving fanatics outside the Palace of Westminster. BBC political presenters no longer have to compete with the megaphone cries of ldquoStop Brexit!.Well, no-one is going to shed any more tears about all that. The Brexit debate turned into a toxic culture war which had very little to do with the real issues of trade and citizenship. Everyone was too busy calling each other Nazis and racists or unpatriotic appeasers.Now the Withdrawal Bill has finally passed, everyone has lost interest. Itrsquos about boring stuff like trade. Yet it marks a historic defeat for the Westminster parliamentary system. The endless procedural wrangles and court actions of the last three years were in retrospect a huge waste of time and intellectual effort.But itrsquos worse than that. Wersquove been left with a legislative horlicks far more damaging than should have been the case. The Withdrawal Act is essentially Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit Bill, but without the ious concessions offered to Labour, without the Northern Ireland backstop and, most important, without parliamentary oversight.The protections on workersrsquo rights and the environment have been removed from the legislation, as has the idea of a regulatory level playing field. Protections for refugee children have been scrapped, along with other Lords amendments.The option of an extension to the transition period, due to end in December, is now ruled out by the Act. The much-debated Political Declaration is shorn of any legislative signicance.MPs will have no say on the negotiating mandate in the coming trade talks. Parliament will have no role in scrutinising the future trade deal.And thatrsquos not all. The ldquoHenry VIII provisions allowing the Government to change laws by secondary legislation, bypassing Parliament altogether, have been beefed up. The courts will not have to abide by the letter of EU law during the transition period.Itrsquos a comprehensive power grab. The Scottish Parliament will not be getting its ball back any time soon.

But Brussels has now ruled out Scotland getting similar concessions to those granted to Northern Ireland. They wonrsquot even talk about it.None of this was inevitable. Under Mayrsquos deal, had it gone through in amended form, Parliament could still have been a major player in Brexit. For three long years, MPs had the power and authority to shape the Withdrawal Agreement ndash but they blew it. Now, Boris Johnson can do whatever he wants.Labour were largely silent this week, probably out of sheer embarrassment. They must know that they helped to make leaving the EU far harder than it need have been. They placed opposing Brexit higher than making the best of Brexit, so they ended up with the worst.It was common knowledge that most MPs favoured a Norway-style option of remaining in the single market while leaving the political institutions of Europe. Hard Brexiters might have complained that joining the EEA was a sellout, but Irsquom pretty sure voters would have accepted staying in the single market as the most sensible short-term solution.Voters werenrsquot bothered about free trade but about sovereignty and identity. Brexit wasnrsquot about erecting tarfs but curbing Brussels bureaucracy. It wasnrsquot really about immigration either. Boris Johnson is already relaxing immigration rules.And evenNorway proved unacceptable, there could have been a Swiss solution, which basically involves accepting the rules of the single market without actually joining it. This was really what Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit deal was moving towards.It sought ldquofrictionless trade by keeping the closest possible relationship with the EU.Her Irish backstop would have kept the entire UK in regulatory alignment with the single market.But the opposition parties werenrsquot having it. The SNP which had argued cogently for Norway plus for two years, suddenly turned into hardline Remainers.The Liberal Democrats went full revoke with disastrous consequences for their leader, Jo Swinson. Labour refused to accept the compromises offered by Theresa May last spring.Remainers thought they had Boris over a barrel that he couldnrsquot reopen the Withdrawal Deal. But he did. His backstop leaves Northern Ireland as a regulatory colony of the EU, but it was undeniably a new deal. Labour condemned it on the grounds that it abandoned Northern Ireland, even though theyrsquod previously claimed the PM was in the pocket of the DUP.Johnson has wasted no time demonstrating that he is not in the pocket of Donald Trump either by backing a digital tax on Google and by refusing to rule out Huaweirsquos involvement in G. Labour claims that the PM intended to ldquosell the NHS to Trump and allow chlorinated chickens to take over the supermarket shelves now look ridiculous.I know this is not how many of my Remain friends on Twitter see it. To them, Brexit was all about fighting fascism and ldquonativism. But the talk of creeping authoritarianism, ldquodark money, Russian interference was a kind of paranoid displacement activity ndash an excuse for not coming to a sensible compromise.The devolved parliaments last week voted to refuse consent to the Withdrawal Act. But any leverage the Scottish Government may have wielded has been lost by the General Election result. Holyrood will now be sidelined in future legislation on fish and farming.This week, on the eve of Brexit Day, Nicola Sturgeon says she will give her latest timetable for independence. But the SNP has no answer to the new constitutional reality: it will now be arguing for independence outside the European Union rather than from within it.Wersquore out of Europe, and wersquore going to stay out for a long time. There will be no referendum this year or next. Brussels is determined to impose a draconian trade deal.

The showrsquos four interviewees ndash including Len McCluskey, head of Unite ndash were male, so in an attempt at balance the three paper reviewers were women.: Minister on alignment and convergenceAmong them was Rachel Johnson, the Prime Ministerrsquos sister.

When a chap has been private secretary to five PMs, from Edward Heath to Tony Blair, there is no shortage of other matters to discuss, but it would have been fun to know.Given his experience, Butler could offer a ldquobeen there, done that, got the memo perspective on Cummingsrsquo plans, among them bringing fresh blood into Whitehall.ldquoWhen I was head of the civil service we were bringing people in from outside, the civil service always has done, it did during the Second World War.Cummings was arguing for more data crunchers, scientists and managers, said Marr, instead of people with degrees in the classics and humanities.

So things are speeding up.\"But he accepted their past erosion predictions were based on past rates, and do not include future sea level change.While an updated analysis is expected in the summer, Prof Hansom warned of the need for urgent action.\"The key thing is you hear a lot of things about climate change and reducing carbon emissions to tackle temperature increases and that is not going to help us for another  years,\" said Prof Hansom, an honorary research fellow at the University of Glasgows School of Geographical and Earth Sciences.\"We have got an adaptational problem now that needs to be addressed, before any of these carbon emission stabilisations or reductions actually produce any effect.\"He believed work is urgently required to reinforce Scotlands eroding coastline through articial extensions of the nations beaches to protect them from the ever-encroaching sea.:Race to save Scotlands greatest golf courses from the seaHe said Holland was leading the way in spending millions of pounds a year in using sand and sediment extracted offshore and deposited to replenish beaches and help shore the coastline up, but Scotland and the UK is lagging behind.\"There is an immediate problem that needs to be addressed now. Think about what is going to happen to your coastline before temperature stabilises,\" he said.\"You have to think seriously about what happens at Edinburgh seafront, what happens across the Glasgow seafront, not to mention the hundreds of wee towns along the coast like Arbroath and Stonehaven and Stornoway.\"When you think where our sewage sites are they are close to sea level, where our railways and roads that hug the coast, they are going to be jeopardised, many are going to be under threat in  or  years time. Before we begin to stabilise carbon emissions and control the temperature, we have got these sea level rises happening now, \" added Prof Hansom, who also said it does not make sense to develop areas that are close to sea level.A new MCCIP report fed into by more than  scientists warns that the latest UK sea-level rise projections is \"higher than previous estimates, implying increased coastal-flood risk\".\"The likelihood of compound effects from tidal flooding and extreme rainfall is increasing, which can greatly exacerbate flood impacts,\" it said.Montrose has been cited as anexample of the threat of climate change to the future of links golf in Scotland.Aseparate analysis on the impact of climate change on coasts but with a focus on transport and infrastructure says that it is estimated the average erosion rates around the Scottish coastline have doubled since the s to . metre per year.: New flood warnings as Orkney predicted to have highest water levels for  yearsNearly , miles of UK transport infrastructure is considered to be at risk of flooding.The report says there are \"several vulnerable stretches\" of railway track including the Ayrshire Coast Line.The  Dynamic Coast project used information drawn from more than , maps and a million data points and was carried out by experts from the Scottish government, Scottish Natural Heritage and the University of Glasgow.It was then discovered that the erosion of the coastline had doubled in speed over the previous  years.Two weeks ago there were warnings of extensivecoastalflooding acrossScotland- as Storm Brendan battered the country.The ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencysaid that on Orkney on Tuesday at Stromness, Stronsay, Scapa, Sanday, Westray, St Margarets Hope, Longhope and Hoy, Burray and Ayre of Cara, water levels were predicted to be the highest in the last  yearsIt warned that any properties that hadbeen affected by coastal flooding in the past were likely to be at risk."},{"url":null,"title":"keir-starmer-calls-radical-redistribution-power-wealth-opportunity-within-new-constitutional-settlement","story":"The Shadow Brexit Secretary, who will travel to Scotland this week, was forced to cancel events when his mother-in-law was admitted to hospital following an accident.He will kick-off a week of campaigning across the UK with a speech in east London this evening arguing for a federal system in which power and resources are devolved.Sir Keir, a frontrunner in the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn, will call for the end of the status quo and say power, wealth and opportunity should be put back into the hands of the people.He said: \"The status quo is not working.

My motto, for the sake of my grandchildren is \"better safe than sorry\".Rose Harvie, Dumbarton.IN focusing on the possible costs of carbon reduction actions Charles Wardrop, conveniently forgets another economic measure, the opportunity costs of not reducing these emissions.The distress and financial costs to Australian friends through the intense bush fires give just one cameo of the total likely to be incurred by the whole worldDonald Trump and Dr Wardrop succeed in persuading us not to bother cutting emissions. There is a technique in economics called discounting, which tries to compare costs incurred today with benefits which only accrue years later. This technique reduces the value of future benefits by a proportion for each year that elapses before they are achieved. The proportion is called the discount rate, and the higher it is, the lower a value is placed on benefits accruing in the future compared to their current cost. The value of the discount rate is related to current financial interest rates, so given the negligibleon investments at the moment with a bank rate below half of one percent, one would now expect the discount rate to be similarly low, and future benefits to be highly valued. Dr Wardrop and his ilk clearly do not recognise this, and would set a mental discount rate close to  per cent, totally devaluing future benefits.The last straw for any reasonable humanitarian is his suggestion that, because Scotlands emissions are only a small proportion of the global total, nothing need be done. So at what percentage of the total does it become morally necessary to take action  In Dr Wardrop and Mr Trumps world, there is no level at which emissions cannot be considered to be trivial. Future generations are likely to judge matters in a very dferent way.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.IN an era of gloomy prophecies, the absurd Doomsday Clock claims to count down the seconds to a looming global apocalypse. But even the most scientically challenged must suspect it is conflating disparate threats with ying degrees of urgency: nuclear war, climate change, and emerging technologies.The stated motivation of those involved in this absurdity is to apply pressure to governments by calling on citizens ldquoto express themselves in all the ways available to them. But we already have the endless rants of the Swedish prophetess Greta Thunberg and most of us could do with just the tiniest break.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.THE fiscal lunacy of spending pound billion on foreign aid is worth exposing. First, we dont actually have pound billion to give away. As we run a deficit economy, that money has to be borrowed ndash at interest of course.Our cumulative annual deficits to date ndash the National Debt ndash amount to pound trillion. That is two thousand billion pounds. The annual interest on that sum is around poundbn a week: poundbn a year.So our poundbn of largesse to countries who either dont need it, or who dont like us, would pay the interest on our National Debt for fourteen weeks.Sooner or later,we carry on living beyond our means, we are likely to be in the clutches of the IMF. One more Labour government would do it, but the money wasted on becoming carbon neutral will certainly do itwe dont wake up to the fact that climate change is a plot to collapse the western financial system.And evenwe were to continue with this daft scheme, we need only to look at the plight of Australia to find a deserving recipient for poundbn.Malcolm Parkin, Kinross."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-nasty-brutal-brazen-undercover-scottish-fox-hunt","story":"Fortunately, there is someone here who can put a stop to it: an investigator whorsquos been watching the whole thing from behind a line of trees. He steps out into the open and speaks to one of the men whorsquos supposed to be controlling the dogs. Suddenly, the atmosphere changes. The hunters call out to the pack and blow their horns and get the hounds under control. The fox has escaped. This time.The investigator, who works for the League Against Cruel Sports, has seen it all before. He has been working on investigations into animal cruelty for  years and Irsquove been out a few times with him on his undercover work. It is tough going. One time, we had to be up at .am. We wear green and brown to blend into the countryside and prevent us being seen. Itrsquos often cold, wet, and miserable. And it leaves me angry and appalled that the law on hunting with dogs is being broken in Scotland so openly, so brutally, and so brazenly.I canrsquot tell you the name of the investigator for obvious reasons ndash he has been threatened with violence and his work would be compromisedthe men and women who hunt foxes knew who he was. But I can tell you what hersquos seen. He has seen many, many foxes running for their lives, like that vixen near Jedburgh. He has seen foxes being disembowelled alive. Hersquos seen a gang of men dig down into a den for an hour just for the privilege of letting their dogs tear a fox apart.:Time to really ban fox hunting in Scotland, for goodAll of it is against the law. In , the Protection of Wild MammalsAct banned the hunting of foxes with dogs, apart from an exemption for the purposes of pest control: according to the law, hunters can still use dogs to flush foxes out of cover so they can be shot. What this means is that, as soon as a fox breaks cover, the dogs should be called back. Either the fox is shot at that point or it gets away. The dogs cannot continue to chase it andthey do, it is a breach of the law.But letrsquos compare that to the hunt in the Borders, shall we  There are several men around, one on a quadbike, several on horseback none of them appear to be carrying guns, which you would expect to seethey were obeying the law. We see the fox break cover and about five minutes later we see the hounds following the scent. We do not hear anyone attempting to control the dogs or anyone calling them back, until the investigator steps forward.What the hunters say in response is that the public is being misled by anti-hunters. When I asked them about the incident in the Borders, the Jed Forest Hunt said there were guns present. Their spokesman at the Scottish Countryside Alliance also told me they were operating a legal pest control service in compliance with the  Act, whereas the League Against Cruel Sports was using the deceitful practice of hiding in bushes and heavily edited footage to suggest illegal practices. The public are being deceived, said the spokesman.However, Irsquove seen the unedited footage. I have been out with the investigator on other investigations and I know what my common sense is telling me: the law on hunting is being broken in Scotland, regularly, openly and blatantly. As for the men and women who do it, the investigator says this of them: ldquoThey are setting a pack of dogs on to wild animals itrsquos like hare coursing. They may dress a little better and they may ride horses, but thatrsquos the only dference. When you see them out in the field, itrsquos savage.Whatrsquos galling for anyone who cares about putting a stop to fox hunting is that the response to the savagery has been spinelessness and a weak law thatrsquos failing to protect wild animals. The Bonomy Review into fox hunting in  said quite clearly that there was evidence that flushing foxes from cover was being used as a decoy for the continuation of traditional hunting practices, and last year the Scottish Government said it would put a stop to it and would bring forward a bill to strengthen the legislation.:Campaigners lodge petition to stop bloodthirsty US hunter from ing to ScotlandBut nothing has happened. There has been no real support either, as far as I can see, for the Green MSP Alison Johnstonersquos private memberrsquos bill which would do what the Government says it wants to do. The Government could fast-track that bill. It hasnrsquot.So what we need ndash quickly, before many more foxes are killed by dogs ndash is a law that deals with the situation as it really is. Men and women are out there, in Scotland, in the open, two or three times a week, for months on end, hunting and killing foxes with dogs, which means the law needs to ban the use of dogs altogether. Such a ban would also help expose the huntersrsquo claims that their aim is to control foxes. This is not about control. This is a sport. Itrsquos a hobby ndash a savage, bloody and barbaric hobby.What the Government needs to say to these people is: you cannot pursue your grubby little hobby here and we will pass a law to make sure you canrsquot. In the meantime, we are relying on the anti-hunters, and the investigators, and anyone with compassion, to keep up the pressure. There is hope of change in Scotland. But all I can hear right now is the sound of the horns and the call of the hounds.

Because what happens in these things is trade-offs. For example, the United Kingdom has a very strong position on fisheries. The UK has a lot of waters and a lot of fish is taken out of your waters by boats from other countries but bear in mind  per cent of the fish you sell, you sell into Europe.\"So unless British people are going to start eating an awful lot more fish, you have a problem there. But thats an area where youre in a strong position. An area where youre in a very weak position is one of the most valuable parts of the British economy which is financial services. Its such a crucial part of the of the British economy. And areas like the entertainment industry. Andfinancial services and entertainment, audio visual are cut off from the single market, the European market, that will be a very severe blow to the British economy and the southeast, in particular in London.\"So, you know, you may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order for us, in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services and thats why things tend to be all in the one package,\" he added.Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman insisted: ldquoOur position on fishing is not going to change. We are going to be taking back control of our own fishing waters.Askedthat ruled out any quid pro quo deal with the EU, he replied: ldquoWe are taking back control of our waters. We have been clear on that both in the manesto and when the PM spoke with the Commission President. The EU should be in no doubt about our determination on that issue.Askedldquofull control of our fishing waters also meant giving access to EU states, he said: ldquoIt will be for the UK to determine in the best interests of the United Kingdom who fishes in its waters.However, a leaked European Council memo that promised to ldquodemonstrate particular vigilancehellipin protecting fishing enterprises and coastal communities raised concern among Scottish politicians.And last week, Charles Grant, the Director of the Centre for European Reform, told a Holyrood committee that senior UK Government officials had indicated they would ldquotrade-off or ldquobargain with Scottish fishing to ldquoget a better deal on financial services.Stewart Stevenson, the SNP MSP, said: ldquoDespite the Tories promises, Scotlandrsquos fishing industry could end up with precisely no gains whatsoever from Brexit. Worse still, it looks like our fishermen could be subject to Common Fisheries Policy rules without even having a voice or a say on the inside.ldquoBoris Johnson needs to be held to account for his  promises the Tories sold out Scottish fishermen on the way into Europe, and theyrsquoll do the same on the way out.He added: ldquoWersquore just days away from crashing out of the EU against our will. Itrsquos time for some honesty from the Tories on how they intend to secure a close economic partnership with Europe without putting fishing on the table.Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland MP, also expressed concern and urged the UK Government not to use fisheries as a ldquobargaining chip in the trade negotiations with the EU.Speaking after meeting members of the Norwegian Fisheries Committee at Westminster, Mr Carmichael said: ldquoDocuments from the European Commission make it plain that they see the status quo as the goal for fisheries negotiations. The Government must prove it has some political will to fulfil the many promises made about an independent fisheries policy during and after the election.ldquoTheir words say one thing actions speak louder. The move of fisheries from the binding Withdrawal Agreement into the non-binding Political Declaration already suggests that the Government may not be all that invested in lsquotaking back controlrsquo in this area.ldquoWe saw the irony last week of a Brexit Party MEP complaining that we will spend the rest of  under the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. This is a direct consequence of the Governmentrsquos abandonment of our fishermen.He added: ldquoNorthern Isles fishermen remember all too well the last time a Tory Government treated the fishing industry as expendable. Repeated, explicit promises by this Government to fishermen must be respected. Fisheries are not Boris Johnsonrsquos bargaining chip with Brussels.But last Wednesday during his Peoplersquos PMQs from Downing, Mr Johnson made clear the UK Government would not ldquotrade away access to Britainrsquos fishing waters.He was askedhe could guarantee the UK would have full control of its fishing waters after Brexit, the PM replied: ldquoYes, we will take back control of our fishing waters. We will ensure that we become an independence coastal state once again, having full jurisdiction over the -mile limit of our spectacular maritime wealth.ldquoWe will make sure we donrsquot trade away Britainrsquos fishing rights as they were traded away for instance in the accession negotiations in the early s.

Irsquove been very clear about the need for any process on independence to be legal and that is my position.The law on a consultative referendum has never been tested, meaning any attempt to hold one would we liable to attract legal challenges and a unionist boycott.Mr McEleny urged Ms Sturgeon to be ldquobolder than she had been to date.He said: ldquoIf the plan requires Boris Johnson to change his heart simply because we keep asking nicely then that plan is doomed to failure.ldquoSome think that perhaps we need toanother pro-independence majority in  [at Holyrood] and things will magically change, but that will justa Parliament with the same make up it has now.ldquoIf the Prime Minister wonrsquot accept the several mandates Scotland has for a referendum now, what dference will another mandate makethe UK government knows there are no political consequences to keep saying No ldquoItrsquos time to adopt a much more radical position that refuses to play Westminsterrsquos game, becausewe keep playing it Scotland will always lose.ldquoWe need to exert maximum leverage on the UK governmenthellip applying pressure in disrupting business in the UK Parliament, seeking the support of the millions of democrats across England that know Boris Johnsonrsquos position is not a democratic position to maintain, and work with them in a campaign of peaceful civil disobedience and protest to ensure Boris Johnson doesnrsquot run roughshod over democracy. ldquoScotland voted - to Remain in Europe in , while the UK voted - to Leave.Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw, who opposed Brexit before Mr Johnson became PM, said: ldquoThis is yet another cynical and obvious display of political opportunism from the First Minister.

I donrsquot underestimate how challenging this is going to be.ldquoBut equally I know what the risks and the realities will bewe donrsquot have this.ldquoIf yoursquore going to have a UK-wide system that is trying to cut migration, and that is a one size fits all, thatrsquos pretty disastrous for Scotland.ldquoSothey want to have that objective in the rest of the UK, but allow some iation within Scotland, then therersquos a discussion to be had there.ldquoIf there is a complete blanket refusal to discuss these things, this sort of view that the Westminster system is incapable of accommodating Scotlandrsquos distinctive interest, just becomes more and more of a real thing.However the Home Office immediately rejected the idea, saying the new immigration system being introduced in  would remain reserved to Westminster.A Home Office spokesperson said: ldquoImmigration will remain a reserved matter. The UK Government will introduce a points-based immigration system that works in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom, including Scotland.ldquoWe want to understand the specic needs of the whole of the UK, which is why we have engaged extensively with stakeholders across the UK, including the Scottish Government.A UK Government source added: We are not planning to devolve immigration, not least because Scottish businesses do not want that to happen.ldquoThey fear the additional red tape it would bring.The issues facing Scotland are not unique to Scotland, so we want to develop a system that is flexible enough to work for all parts of the UK.There has been less migration to Scotland than to some other parts of the UK.ldquoThe Scottish Government have extensive economic powers and should be using those to make Scotland a more attractive place to settle, live and work.SNP MSP Tom Arthur said: ldquoIndustry and employers recognise that getting the migration system right is vital for our social and economic wellbeing, and the support shown for the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposals are heartening.ldquoConsidering that support, the UK government need to do much better than a curt dismissal.ldquoSimply dismissing this serious plan out of hand proves our point that Westminster doesnrsquot work for Scotland.Labour MSP Claire Baker said: ldquoScotland faces particular demographic challenges, and we need a compassionate, fair immigration system that supports our economy, public services and all our people.ldquoTherefore, Scottish Labour supports exploring a degree of flexibility within an overarching UK immigration system.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

Currently, it supports communities in northern Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Mark said: “Our focus is enabling people to rebuild their livelihoods. We do that by offering skills training in everything from computer skills to bee keeping. That one struck me as odd but it turns out everyone loves honey!“Embrace the Middle East also supports intercommunal peace building. The charity is led by local partners and shows how changes, big and small, can make a dference.”While many Iraqi citizens have chosen not toto their homeland, Embrace is there to help those who do.Mark added: “Their homes and agricultural land have been damaged. Our focus is future-proofing their ability to stay in their communities.“We’re not an NGO which is there for a short-term fix – we are there for the long term.”As well as working for Embrace the Middle East three days a week, Mark is an honorary fellow at Aberdeen University and has also taught social sciences at Stirling and Durham Universities."},{"url":null,"title":"support for social enterprise","story":"Local social enterprise Wood RecyclAbility has received funding support from international firms in a bid to help their expansion plans.Wood RecyclAbility is looking to raise £, to expand and offer more opportunities for adults with learning disabilities.The social enterprise has been providingpractical work experience and training for people with additional support needs for  years and has prevented over , tons of waste wood from going to landfill.The social enterprise makes a range of products such as bird tables, planters and garden benches from the waste wood.The Ellon-based organisation has now received a £, funding boost from CNOOC International as they look to purchase equipment to ersy their work by recycling rigid plastic and mattresses.This comes after BP offered £, last month to support their work, along with a new contract secured with NHS Grampian to create  lockable boxes made from recycled wood.Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin welcomed the funding and said: “I know this money will make a real and tangible dference.”Operations manager Brian Reid said: “This is a fantastic start to our fundraising efforts, to enable us to recycle more rigid plastics and embark on mattress recycling.“As a social enterprise we really appreciate the generosity given to us both in terms of time and funding from CNOOC International.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When he first came to this country, in , his English was almost non-existent. He made many mistakes. On one occasion he put a letter in a bin bearing the legend LITTER. But he was a hard worker and a quick learner. And by the mid-s, he could hold his own at Scrabble. One of my memories of him involves him freaking out because he had forgotten the Italian word for grapefruit. It’s “pompelmo” – one of the few words I do remember from back then, along with “zanzari”and “fiammeri” .I wasn’t brought up bilingual. My dad worked long hours and I spent most of my time with my Scottish mum. Instead, I was sent to Saturday morning Italian classes, which I hated because most of the other children there spoke it at home. Now and again, my dad would decree the dinner table an Italian-only zone. Those nights I ate in sullen silence.Then, when I was , my dad died, and so, though I later went on to sit my Higher, I never became fluent enough to keep up with the noisy, free-flowing conversation that is integral to Italian family le.With hindsight, this feels like a pity. Being able to speak more than one language is a gt. It widens your horizons and makes you more employable Also, language and culture are intimately connected. A country’s language shapes its ideas as surely as it expresses them. It is fundamental to its identity and its sense of humour. When you do not share a language, it is dficult to share jokes. And the ability to share jokes is at the heart of human relationships.My lack of fluency was in part responsible for my eventual detachment from my Italian heritage. If your language skills are patchyyou are unable to grasp sub-text and innuendo and nuance, then, however hard you try to belong, you will always be on the outside looking in.I have been thinking about all this since I read about the Comhairle Nan Eilean Siarplan to increase bilingualism. From next year pupils starting primary will be taught in Gaelic, switching to English only in Primary , by which point speaking Gaelic ought to be second nature to them.The idea is inspired. Around , of the Western Isles’ population speak the language and more than half of parents already opt into Gaelic Medium Education . However, by making GME the default setting, with an opt-out for parents who are opposed, the local authority is positioning bilingualism as the norm.Anyone who has witnessed their primary school child being taught French as part of the Scottish government’s + policy will understand the limitations of trying to shoe-horn a foreign language into an overcrowded curriculum. GME overcomes those limitations. And it’s an approach that is increasingly popular where. The number of children enrolled in Canada’s French immersion schools rose by a fth between  to  as aspirational parents realised the educational benefits.In this context, Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith’s intervention last week looks out of touch. She called the Western Isles’ move “deeply troubling” and suggested being taught in Gaelic could put pupils at a disadvantage. But there is no evidence for this. As human cognitive neuroscientist Dr Thomas Bak pointed out in a letter to The Scotsman such a view is based on the assumption that – as there is only a limited space in our brain – adding something new means taking something  away.“It assumes all pieces of knowledge that we learn are unconnected,” he wrote. “This is not the case. Every new piece of information we get is integrated with already existing knowledge and in this way can strengthen rather than weaken what we know already.”Studies show bilingual children outstrip their monoglot counterparts in cognitive tests and these advantages extend into later le with bilingualism linked to the delayed onset of dementia and better recovery after a stroke.Encouraging more Gaelic speaking will also redress some of the damage done by the  Education Act and help reconnect the next generation with their own culture. This pernicious piece of legislation put an end to Gaelic medium schools and punished those who continued to use the language.Establishment contempt for the country’s minority languages continued into the second half of the th century with those who expressed themselves in anything other than standard English still belted as late as the s.Not surprisingly this evocative language started to die out. Between  and , the number of Gaelic speakers dropped from , to , .In the s, however, there was a sht in thinking. Politicians began to realise the potential for Gaelic to revive depopulated areas and stimulate economic growth. There was increased funding for Gaelic arts, television and education, with Gaelic medium schools opening in the central belt as well as in traditional Gaelic-speaking areas.Until recently, there was a cross-party consensus on its importance. In , a law to protect and promote Gaelic was passed by the then Labour administration at Holyrood.As with much , however, Gaelic was re-politicised by the indyref with ultra unionists perceiving it as a nationalist totem. So now, every attempt to bolster it is met with a backlash. How much ink has been wasted whining about the cost of Gaelic road signs  Though, Transport Scotland says only £, was spent between  and , and the Scottish government has only ever received two complaints.The same sentiments have been expressed over the addition of Scots on to the primary school curriculum, although reading a handful of poems is unlikely to turn pupils into SNP activists.It’s not unusual, of course, for minority languages to face opposition. Disagreements over the Irish Language Act – which should give the Irish language equal status in Northern Ireland – contributed to the collapse of Stormont. But such hostility is short-sighted. Moderate and culturally-minded unionists understand this. Last week, Donald Cameron, Tory MSP for the Highlands and Islands, tweeted his support for the Western Isles’ plan . Distancing himself from Smith, he said his party had been promoting Gaelic for  years.This was not the first time Cameron had spoken up. In , he appealed to ultra unionists to tone down their rhetoric on the language. Having studied it himself, he understands its value.What the Western Isles is trying to do is impressive. If it succeeds it will produce a generation of children as much at home with Gaelic as with English. As someone who missed out on bilingualism, I’m glad its pupils are being given a skill that will keep them in touch with their heritage. And I find it deeply troubling that anyone would seek to stand in their way.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how would the snp s scottish visa system work","story":"Nicola Sturgeon appeared in Edinburgh today to call on the UK Government to engage with proposals for a separate Scottish visa system aimed at tackling the countrys post-Brexit needs.Under the Scottish Governments preferred model for the scheme, which would require talks with the UK Government due to immigration being reserved, migrants would apply separately to the Scottish Government for a visa to live only in Scotland and Holyrood would recommend applicants to the Home Office.But how does the proposed system work • Targets to bring down migration to the UK would be ended• Fees and charges for UK immigration should be reviewed and simplied, removing \"financial and administrative burdens\"• A new-points based system for the UK should follow international examples and include regional or devolved schemes•Family migration should be \"signicantly reviewed\", looking at definition of family members, costs, and children born here• The employer-sponsored visa should have a lower salary threshold• The proposed transitional -month visa should be extended to  months and made a permanent option for EU citizens after the UK leaves the EU• Arrangements for working visitors should be extended to six months, and a broader range of activities should be allowed©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch here s why the tories have it so wrong on gaelic","story":"Liz Smith should be proud. The Scottish Conservatives# education spokesperson has single-handedly propelled Gaelic to the top of Scotland#s cultural agenda with her roundly condemned snub to Scotland#s ancient language.The linguistic rammy began when Western Isles Councilannounced plans to provide only Gaelic medium educationin Primary . Parents can opt outthey want children taught in English. Last Thursday in Holyrood, Liz Smith said the move was “deeply troubling” and would put pupils in the Western Isles at a “distinct disadvantage.” Why Has Ms Smith not read the copious evidence which shows that bi-lingual childrenhave better job prospects and better cognitive health in later le  I’m sure she has. Liz Smith seems to take her job seriously and has always appeared well-briefed and relatively open to new ideas.So, does the Tory MSP just have a problem with Gaelic  If so, she must have missed the fact that Sgoil Ghàidhlig Ghlaschuregularly outperforms every other secondary in Glasgow, with half of sixth years achieving five or more Highers. Strange.Ms Smith has somehow also missed the fact that UK language studentslag behind only lawyers, medics and vets in employability. It also seems that even when language graduates are not employed to speak their primary language, the fact they’ve spoken two languages from a young age, makes it far easier to learn more. It’s this versatility, this aptitude for overcoming cultural barriers, this belief in the innate ability of humans to connect and this willingness to inhabit the mindset of other cultures that makes bi-lingual students so very valuable. But I suspect Liz Smith knows that. I’m also guessing Ms Smith agrees with Dr Thomas H. Bak, an expert in human cognitive neuroscienceat Edinburgh University, who observed in a letter to this paper: “There is a wealth of evidence suggesting bilingual children outperform monolingual ones on cognitive tests ... and these effects are not confined to childhood, [but] continue across the lespan leading to a slower cognitive ageing, delayed onset of dementia and better cognitive recovery after stroke. Remarkably, an improvement in attention has been documented in participants of all ages after a one-week intensive language course … in Gaelic.”I imagine she was also nodding at the views of Professor Wilson McLeod of Edinburgh University, who told a Sunday newspaper why no Mandarin or German-medium schools exist in Scotland“We have Gaelic medium education because parents fought like hell to get it. They organised, they mobilised, they petitioned, and lobbied councillors and just wouldn’t let go. There have been other programmes – there was one in Italian in Glasgow, one in French in Aberdeen. They have never really gone anywhere, there has never been a drive for it.”Quite. There’s a big drive to learn Gaelic at the moment – prompted in part by the young Gaels behind Scots Gaelic Duolingo. Perhaps Liz Smith hadn’t heard of this sassy new online learning package. I imagine she has now.Last year, this small group of Gaelic language activists successfully lobbied Duolingo – a free language learning  with more than  million users and  languages – to include Scots Gaelic. Now it has  thousand signed-up students – that’s twice as many as the official Gaelic-speaking total and includes , who joined in the wake of Liz Smith’s remarks, and a related newspaper article which attacked bi-lingual road-signs, the efficacy of Bòrd na Gàidhlig and the “sacred cow” status of the Gaelic language.Add in the patient, educational work of the Feisean movementthrough the medium of Gaelic since the s. Add in the inspirational influence of Gaelic-speaking musicians from Julie Fowlis and Karen Mathieson to Peat n Diesel and the director of Celtic Connections, Donald Shaw. Even folk who don’t speak Gaelic now know for sure they’re missing something. That wasn’t true even five years ago.Perhaps that’s why Liz Smith made a welcome about-turn this weekend when she tweeted an apology “to those members of the Gaelic community who have been offended. My concerns did not relate to the quality of GME teaching  learning, both of which have such a strong record”.Of course, that only raised more questions. If the standard of Gaelic Medium teaching isn’t the problem then what is  Many think it’s a straightforward belief that Gaelic’s a “loser language”. This kind of cultural cringe is certainly well-documented but also outdated and faintly embarrassing.As Argyll MSP and Brexit Minister Mike Russell tweeted last week “It’s very sad to see someone as intelligent as Liz Smith parroting such nonsense.” So, does the MSP for Mid Scotland and Fe really share the tired, old, knuckle-dragging aversion to Scotland’s precious, traditional cultures  I’ll stick my neck out and say I don’t think so. More likely she has been sucked into the dark side of Toryism by the need to fit in with new political masters swept to power south of the Border on a xenophobic, anti-foreigner  of pro-Brexit isolationism.Last February, a BBC report showed that the places most likely to have no French or German teaching in school were the biggest Leave areas in England. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but maybe it reflects a worrying pushback against the sound of languages other than English being spoken in Britain. Does that pushback now include the indigenous languages of Scotland  If so, it’s a massively dangerous development.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon s scottish immigration visa plan refused by uk government","story":"The UK government has immediately ruled out Nicola Sturgeons proposal to devolve immigration to Holyrood.The First Minister today launched a proposal to introduce a Scottish visa, to ensure Scotlands population and workforce were able to grow post-Brexit.The plan would have seen no cap on immigration, and there were also no details as to how to ensure migrants to Scotland would not end up working in other parts of the UK.: Watch as Nicola Sturgeon reveals details of her Scottish visa plansHowever the Scottish Government had hoped its -page document would open negotiations on how a \"tailored\" immigration scheme could work for Scotland.But within hours of Ms Sturgeon unveiling the proposal, the UK government said immigration would remain a \"reserved matter\" and the new scheme being currently being created would apply to the whole of the UK, as introducing dferentials would make the system \"massively complicated\".A Home Office spokesperson said:“Immigration will remain a reserved matter. The UK Government will introduce a points-based immigration system that works in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom, including Scotland.“We want to understand the specic needs of the whole of the UK, which is why we have engaged extensively with stakeholders across the UK, including the Scottish Government.”Boris Johnsons new immigration system will operate from  and it is expected to be based on Australias point-based immigration. The Migration Advisory Committee is expected to report shortly into how such a system would operate.It is also reviewing the proposed £, minimum salary threshold for migrant workers, and UK ministers have already signalled they are ready to drop the level after concern from business leaders that it could prevent workers needed to support the economy from entering the UK.There are already UK-wide and Scotland specic \"Shortage Occupation Lists\" and Mr Johnson has said he wants a system based on applicants’ skills and qualications as well as labour shortages.He has said migrants will be sorted into three categories: exceptionally talented people such as “nuclear physicists”, who would be granted free entry skilled workers, who could settlethey had a job and unskilled workers who would only be granted short-term visas in sectors with skills shortages.The Prime Ministers official spokesman also said it was unlikely that UK ministers would engage with the Scottish Government on the issue. \"Were very clear that we want an immigration system that works for the whole UK,\" the spokesman said. \"Immigration policy is a matter for the UK Government.\"Today the First Minister admitted her government had not yet entered into discussions with the Home Office about how a \"tailored\" approach to Scottish immigration could work, but it had been \"touched on\" when they pair had met last summer. \"We will be seeking to intensy that now we have published these proposals,\" she said.She added that her proposals were necessary to address Scotlands depopulation - it has the lowest fertility rate in the UK - and to tackle skills gaps in the wake of Brexit.It is predicted thatEU migration to the UK is halved the UK population would still grow by . per cent over the next  years, but the Scottish population would only increase by one per cent. It has also been estimated that Scottish GDP could by . per cent lower by  as a result of lower migration compared to . per cent across the UK as a whole.Ms Sturgeon said that the figures proved the \"urgent need\" to ensure immigration continued to Scotland. She said under the current constitutional arrangements, she wanted responsibility for immigration policy split with the UK government. Migrants who want to live and work in Scotland could choose to apply for a Scottish Visa, with residing in Scotland and maintaining a Scottish tax code the main requirements. They could also still apply through one of the UK immigration routes.However, when asked how she could ensure that people applying for a Scottish Visa would remain in Scotland and not move where in the UK, she said the only tracking measure would be the Scottish tax code.: SNP set to unveil ‘Scottish visa’ plan to combat Brexit\"We already have the infrastructure here as part of the devolution of income tax,\" she said. \"Often - and m not saying its completely wrong - but often we take the view of immigration which starts out with the assumption that \"theyre at it\" and want to abuse the system, but thats not the case for the vast majority of people who want to come here to get a job, to stay and contribute and raise their families and that should be our starting point.\"Yes we can have discussions about what we do with the minority of cases where that might be dferent, but having that Scottish tax code as the building block is the most signicant part. Part of it is also shting our mindset and our perspective - the numbers of people who come to try and abuse the system are actually very small and we cannot allow the system to be driven by that as perhaps has been the case for too long.\"Later, when pressed on the issue again, she added: \"Of course there are points of detail to be worked through but there is nothing that is insurmountable in thistheres the political will there to do it. HMRC already operate the Scottish tax code and its up to HMRC as a government agency to implement government policies, but they would not be policing it.\"Ms Sturgeon saida migrants job came to end within the time of their Visa they wouldnt automatically have to leave Scotland, but details like that would be dealt with \"in the system design\".\"We dont start from the point of people coming to game the system, thats not the reality of people coming to work here. We dont design a system catering for the exception rather than the rule,\" she said.Asked about whether there would be a cap on immigration numbers, given the policy paper suggests quotas could be set by agreement between the UK and Scottish governments, she said: \"I dont favour arbitrary targets around immigration, we need to be able to attract what we need for the needs of the country and thats the starting point.\"We have deliberately designed this paper to open up the discussion about the detail of how this will work within a UK framework. We are willing to consult on these things, thats leaving open as much room for discussion as possible - my starting point is I dont favour arbitrary targets, butgetting to a point where a Scottish visa is to be agreed by the UK government requires some discussion around that Im open to having that discussion. Were trying very hard to leave as much open to discussion as possible.\"One of the driving factors has to be the population statistics, what do we need to do to stop our population going into decline  And there are also regional requirements - there are parts of our country, rural areas in particular, and part industry requirements as well, sectors like tourism and hospitality who have specic needs, My in-principle position is arbitrary targets and quotas get in the way of that.\": Scotland should get its own ‘distinct’ immigration rules under new pilotThe First Minister said that inward migration had to be improved to ensure the sustainability of rural communities, as did \"transport and digital infrastructures\". She added: \"Theres a whole suite of things that we have to do alongside this [immigration], but the overall trends in our population mean thatwe close off or substantially reduce the supply of people coming in from other countries then we will make it dficult to keep our population growing and that will have a disproportionate impact on rural communities.\"Ms Sturgeon also said she was aware there would be some \"concern\" about immigration in Scotland, but said it was her \"duty to level with people\" about why it was necessary.She added: \"I dont think this is an easy thing for politicians, its not always a pain-free subject for politicians. ButI were not to make the case for immigration at best, or go along with anti-immigration rhetoric at worst, then Im doing that knowing it would have real, damaging impact on Scotlands prosperity and it wouldnt be the right thing to do, and politicians should argue for the right thing evenits dficult.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered.

This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks!

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

Patten a reality.Mr O’Connor said Mr Mallon’s political career was characterised by a refusal to become partisan, his sense of fair play and his fierce and unwavering commitment to non-violence.His

There is a possibility for us to work together with the United Kingdom over the next few months and come to a future relationship and a trade agreement that’s mutually beneficial, and that’s the spirit in which we will be entering these talks.”Mr Barnier said he would present EU member states with a draft negotiating mandate next month ahead of March’s EU Council summit, where the bloc’s finalised stance on talks will be ratied.Mr Barnier said the UK’s level of access to the single market would be proportionate to the commitments Britain gave to comply with EU regulations.“It’s time for the second round,” he said of the negotiations.“This time it is very short,have no time to lose in any politics. I always worked with everybody in UK with respect and I will continue.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly ruled out requesting an extension to the transition period, during which the UK abides by EU rules, to facilitate further talks.Speaking in London, Mr Johnson again insisted it should be possible to “wrap all this up” by the end of the year.“We will be doing things very fast,very friendly and respectful way, and in a way also, I think it’s important to stress, that really ensures we look after the interests of the Republic of Ireland as well,” he said.However Mr Barnier saidno agreement was reached by the end of the year it “cannot be business as usual”.“We are to face a risk of a clf edge, in particular for trade,” he added.“We will use this time maintaining our line, protecting our interests, our principles and always willing to build the strong and ambitious partnership.“The UK is there as a friend and an ally for our common security and economic partners.”Mr Varadkar, who reiterated his own concerns about being able to strike a deal by December , said the UK would be welcomed back into the EUit ever wanted to .Real pleasure to welcome @MichelBarnier back to Dublin today.

Butit does not, there will always be a seat kept for them at the table.”Ahead of the meeting with Mr Barnier, the Taoiseach told the BBC the EU would enter talks in a stronger position than the UK.“The European Union is a union of  member states. The UK is only one country. And we have a population and a market of  million people,” he said.“The UK, it’s about  . Sothese were two teams up against each other playing football, who do you think has the stronger team ”On Monday, Mr Varadkar denied he used the words “upper hand”.“I think I used the term strong hand rather than upper hand,” he said.In the BBC interview, Mr Varadkar also warned against a “piecemeal” approach to the talks, with the UK wishing to only focus on certain aspects of the future relationship. and Michel Barnier meet in Dublin \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Leo Varadkarand Michel Barnier meet in Dublin “When I hear people talk about piecemeal, it sounds a bit like cake and eat it,” he said. “That isn’t something that will fly in Europe.”The Taoiseach also told the BBC that the UK’s colonial history may have led politicians to misunderstand the way the EU worked in the st century.“I think there are people in Britain who thought that France, Germany and Britain would get together at a big summit and tell the smaller countries what’s what,” he said.“That is not the way the st century works.”Asked about his meeting with Mr Johnson on the Wirral last autumn – an encounter seen as vital in securing a Brexit breakthrough – Mr Varadkar said the chance for the two men to sit down and “talk turkey” in the absence of officials had been key.Amid claims from Mr Johnson that the deal will not involve checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, Mr Varadkar said the Withdrawal Deal stated in “black and white” that some checks would be required.After his meeting in Dublin, Mr Barnier said the Withdrawal Agreement would not have been possible without the unied approach of people and politicians in Ireland.He singled out Mr Varadkar and his team for particular praise.“So the moment has finally come – the UK leaving the EU on Friday,” he said.“Thankfully, it is leaving with a deal. It was not easy to get here.”Asked about the forthcoming Irish General Election, Mr Barnier insisted a change in government would not impact his working relationship with Ireland.“I will work with the government chosen by the citizens,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus student in ireland isolated after travelling from wuhan in china","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, DUP Alderman for the area, David Ramsey, has welcomed the commencement of demolition work at the site and he believes a boundary and fencing offers enough protection. Radius Housing Association submitted an application in May  to construct forty-nine residential units with associated landscape and access works on the site of the former Ebrington Primary School. The application is currently under consideration with a view to bringing it before Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee at the “earliest opportunity”, a council spokesperson confirmed. googletag.cmd.push The site has lain vacant since Ebrington P.S. relocated to a new site on the Limavady Road in . In that time there have been issues with anti-social behaviour and the building was badly damaged in two arson attacks. The planned housing development is situated in a backland site between the Limavady Road and Rossdowney Road on lands south of Glendermott Cricket Club. Documents associated with the application show that the Council’s Environmental Health Service has raised concerns about the possibility of cricket balls struck at the Glendermott C.C. ground landing in the housing development - particularly when professional players are batting as they can hit the ball a greater distance. googletag.cmd.push Each team in the league is permitted the use of one professional overseas player and up to  competitive games at first class cricket level could also be played during the season. The document states: “It is recognised that cricket balls can travel a distance of up to .m and within the proposed development. Cricket balls that travel a distance more than .m will therefore land within the development boundary and on the roadway. “Such cricket balls will not stop dead but will have sufficient momentum to travel a further distance with the potential to strike adjacent property, vehicles and pedestrians. “Therefore, it is anticipated that the overall frequency of first class standard play with the ability to hit a ball up to . metres and the potential to cause damage to property persons has increased beyond that stated in the GM Design risk assessment.”  Much-needed DUP Alderman for the Waterside area, David Ramsey, welcomed progress towards construction at the site. He said: “At long last the demolition has begun, Glendermott CC and the surrounding community will be delighted. The site should be cleared by February and as far as I’m aware Radius is ready to move in and start work. “This now means progress on the much needed affordable housing and improved green space will be commencing soon. “Many people have great memories of this building, end of an era and making way for a new beginning.” Cllr Ramsey went on to explain that he and other party representatives have been “inundated” with housing related issues from constituents. The Waterside area is in need of  bungalows to meet the current demand with many elderly and disabled residents in search of single-storey houses. Glendermott Cricket Club is also pleased that it will get ground back that was taken away when the former school was built, Cllr Ramsey added. New residents moving into the area could also prove positive in terms of recruiting new members to the club.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She was keen to help those in need and to get people involved.Making time for others, she had a listening ear and often offered advice in compassionate ways. She liked being at the heart of things, and she was the le and soul of the party.Helena, from the Crocknamohil Road close to Draperstown, went missing on November .She was last seen near the Foyle Bridge in Derry city.Her remains were discovered last Tuesday evening by search teams on the River Foyle, who had been scouring the area every day since her disappearance. Her family, including husband Declan and four children - Kayla, Ben, Kaeden andNiah-Rose - all aged from one to  years-old, had held out hope she wouldhome.On Monday morning they gathered with hundreds of others in a final farewell to the much loved daughter, sister, mum and we.Special recognition was given during the funeral mass from the McElhennon and McGlone families for the tireless, daily efforts by family, friends and strangers in looking for Helena.Passing on their thanks, Fr McGirr said: Over these past number of weeks Helena has been on the minds and in the prayers of countless people across our erse, good-hearted and generous community. Helena’s people also deeply appreciate the supportive messages from people conveyed across dferent s expressing their compassion and kindest thoughts.People were keen to help and pray for Helena. They have been opening their hearts and sharing their moments with a neighbour and people they’re feeling for. “They and the generosity of local businesses donating food for volunteers and family members also helped to draw Helena gently home.As sincere people and as a community of faith gathered here at St Patrick’s, we share our sympathy with everyone among Helena’s family and friends grieving her passing today. We also reach out to God to help and console us in our sorrow, and we pray to him for the happy repose of Helena’s soul in the le to come, because we would like her to have that peace very much.”Yesterday, messages of support continued to be posted on a Facebook page set up in the search for Helena.As well as offers of thoughts and prayers, messages lent support for her family and expressed relief that their agonising search had finally come to an end. Last week after news that Helenas body had been foud, her family thanked those who had left comforting messages. “Helena was a beautul person and earth angel. She’s now an angel in heaven reunited with our Daddy, goddaughter and other family members,” a Facebook post read. Helena is survived by her husband Declan and four children, her mother Mary and her siblings Rosaleen, Teresa, Michael and Sean.For emotional support you can call the Samaritans -hour helpline on  , email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is focussing on four constituencies - Cavan, Wexford, Donegal and the retention of the Meath West seat. ,However, Cllr McCloskey said she felt it was important to stand in Sligo Leitrim. Aontuacute is a fledgling political party, she said. We have a group of very committed activists in Sligo who were very keen for someone to stand. The constituency takes in all of counties Sligo and Leitrim, part of southern Donegal and part of northern Roscommon.” googletag.cmd.push  Peter Casey Cllr McCloskey said the party had a “mountain to climb” with just over two weeks to polling day on  February but she was “looking forward to the challenge.” Cllr McCloskey claimed the party had gained supporters from across the political spectrum, including from the unionist community. Aontuacute was established last year after Peadar Toacuteibiacuten left Sinn Feacutein. He claimed he had been ostracised from the party because of his opposition to abortion. Several high-profile former Sinn Feacutein members, including Francie and Anne Brolly, later joined the party. Aontuacute claimed three seats in last years local elections in the Republic.If elected, Cllr McCloskey would be expected to stand down from her seat on Derry City and Strabane District Council.Meanwhile, former Presidential candidate Peter Casey this week revealed his intention to stand as a General Election candidate in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s constituency.Mr Casey, who lives in Greencastle in Inishowen, had already filed papers to stand in Donegal, revealed he nominated himself to stand in Dublin West.The businessman finished second behind Michael D Higgins in the  Presidential race, when he drew controversy over his remarks about the Travelling community.He also unsuccessfully stood for European Parliament in the Midlands-North West constituency last year. Announcing his candidacy, Mr Casey said he was standing in the Dublin constituency to give people an opportunity to register “an obvious protest vote” against Varadkar.“The Taoiseach’s string of failures is recorded for all to see,” he said.“There’s the swing-gate and fobgate scandals, the National Children’s Hospital disgrace, the broadband spending debacle, the unprecedented crises in health and housing – list goes on and people have had enough… “People are right to be angry and that’s why I’m giving them the opportunity to voice their anger directly by voting for me in Dublin West.”Speaking at the registration office, the -year-old said he believed Mr Varadkar was not fit to be Taoiseach, but said he would not canvas there, adding that his primary goal would be to represent the people of Donegal.As well as the Taoiseach, Mr Casey will face competition for the Dublin constituency’s four seats from outgoing TDs Joan Burton of Labour, Fianna Faacuteil’s Jack Chambers, and Solidarity-People Before Profit’s Ruth Coppinger.Others standing in the constituency include Fine Gael’s Emer Currie, Sinn Feacutein’s Paul Donnelly, the Green Party’s Roderic O’Gorman, Aengus Oacute Maolaacutein, Aontuacute’s Edward Mac Manus and independent candidates Stephen O’Loughlin and Sean O’Leary. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reverend David Latimer is retiring after  years as a minister at First Derry Presbyterian Church. Reverend Latimer came to prominence in the last decade through his friendship with Sinn Fein politician and former IRA man Martin McGuinness. The two men first met when Reverend Latimer appealed to Mr McGuinness to condemn a vandalism attack on First Derry church at Magazine Street in Derrys city centre. From that first meeting developed a friendship between the two men which attracted admiration and criticism. Reverend Latimer has spoken of how some of his congregation who had lost loved ones at the hands of the IRA could not accept his friendship with Mr McGuinness, who died in . googletag.cmd.push However, the local clergyman, who was originally from County Down, said that his relationship with Mr McGuinness was part of a reconciliation process between dferent communities. That theme was evident today at Reverend Latimers final Sunday service at First Derry church. Among the packed congregation were members of Mr McGuinnesss family along with leading Sinn Fein figures. Speaking at the service, Reverend Latimer said he was sad that Mr McGuinness could not be with them but was grateful that his we, Bernie, and other family members could be there. He said it was important that communities reached out the hand of friendship to each other. googletag.cmd.push “We must hold hands, not grudges,” said Reverend Latimer. The service was co-celebrated by local Catholic priest, Father Michael Canny, who paid tribute to his colleague. For more on todays service see tomorrows Derry News.

Patients registered to a MDT practice are able to book an appointment directly with any of these new services, without first having to see their GP. The model also includes signicant investment in additional nursing specialist roles such as health visiting and district nursing.The Derry GP Federation was one of the first areas in Northern Ireland to benefit from this transformation initiative. Since its introduction, just over one year ago, over , patient appointments have taken place with these new MDT staff.The project has recruited signicant numbers of additional staff to work within GP practices. Seventy two staff are already in post and  more are due to start in coming months. To accommodate these additional staff, a signicant programme of capital investment in the buildings which house GP practices has been accompanying the project.Dr Martin McCloskey, chairperson of the Derry Federation of Family Practices, said the introduction of the initiative in the Derry area had resulted in an increase in capacity in GP practices. “The approach sees our practice teams being supported to identy opportunities for early intervention, with an increased focus on the physical, mental and social wellbeing of our communities. We are now beginning to see the rewards and are confident that MDTs will not only improve the health and well being of our local communities but help to secure the future of general practice in the North West.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Rice Bowlclosed for a month so the owner could get married. But rather than put up a standard “closed” sign, a giant photo of a customer entering the takeaway was placed over the shopfront.  The owner – known only as Mr Chang – came up with the hilarious idea after an elderly neighbour said she didn’t feel safe without his customers about. Mr Chang, , ed from his honeymoon to discover a month’s-worth of very confused – and hungry – customers on his CCTV system. googletag.cmd.push So he decided to share the best of the clips on social media. The clips were captioned: “The award goes to the lady that tried to look through a window that is really not a window.” The series of funny clips show baffled customers scratching their heads as they try to gain entry to the shop. In one, a woman in a checked coat is seen attempting to push the fake door. After getting nowhere, she then attempts to peer through the  window and pushes her full weight against the wall. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Stute also drew a blank in terms of goals for the seventh time in that period, and with Warrenpoint grabbing a late win at Carrick, the Blues have now slipped to last place after several weeks of treading water.It is a concerning time for Connor and his and with a game against the Point just a few weeks away, they will be hoping to get a win out of somewhere before that huge six-pointer.Whilst Stute improved in the second half of Saturdays game, they did not do enough to test home goalkeeper Conor Byrne throughout, and not for the first time this season, indiscipline in their own penalty area cost them as they conceded yet another penalty. Connor made a number of changes as he tried to freshen things up, bringing in Conor Tourish, Cormac Burke and Ahu Obhakhan for Evan Tweed, Oran Brogan and Alex Pomeroy, who all dropped to the bench.New signing Obhakhan almost gted Dungannon a goal as early as the fourth minute as his pass found Caolan McAleer, but the ex-Finn Harps mans long range drive failed to trouble Stute goalkeeper Rory Brown. The last two games between these sides had been memorable for all sorts of reasons, but this was not following suit as both teams struggled for inspiration, half chances falling for Dungannon as Terry Fitzpatricks tame effort was easily gathered by a ing Brown before the Stute goalkeeper saved from Hughes from distance. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -Stute upped their efforts after the break and they finally tested the hosts when Joe McCreadys low drive was saved at the second attempt by Swts keeper Byrne.That was the beginning of the best period in the game for the visitors and just before the hour mark Currys header from Burkes left wing corner caused problems for Swts, who somehow scrambled the ball awya from danger. Stutres vulnerability at set-plays cost them dearly just after the hour mark when Dungannon finally broke through, McAleers cross finding King at the back post who powerfully headed home. That changed the momentum of the game and the lead was doubled just over ten minutes later when Tourish brought down McAleer inside the box, leaving referee Tony Clarke with no option but to point to the spot. Douglas Wilson made no mistake with the resulting penalty, drilling the ball low into Browns bottom left hand corner to seal the points. Stute had no answer and Swts should have added a third when Hughes fed an unmarked McAleer, but with only Brown to beat, the winger fired wide with the goal at his mercy.In the closing stages Gareth Brown went close to grabbing a consolation as his snap-shot beat Byrne but flashed just wide. googletag.cmd.push TeamsDungannon Swts: Byrne, Lowe, Wilson, King, Teggart Campbell, Fitzpatrick , Smyth , McAleer Carvill, Hughes .Institute: R Brown, Morrow, Tourish, D Curry, McLaughlin G Brown, McCauley , Crown, BurkeMcCready , Obhakhan.Referee: Tony Clarke .

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre.

Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any

warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading visitor attraction which would provide an economic boost for the area.Residents opposed to changes argue that Killough boasts the ldquofinest example of a lighthouse of its kind and that no one is in any doubt about the maritime history and heritage of St Johnrsquos Point and its uniqueness.Campaigners say that they are determined to protect the heritage of the lighthouse and suggest it is

bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

Meanwhile Jarlath Kearney , Caragh Moore , Rory Morris , Alex Robinson , and Kara Trainorwere all in third place.All our athletes, irrespective of placings, gave of their best and most importantly seemed to have fun.On a personal level, I feel that two items stood out for me as an interested bystander.Firstly, it was great to see that newcomers, our neighbours from Murlough AC, are starting to make their presence felt and will no doubt go on to compete strongly for team awards in the years ahead.And secondly, the Year  boysrsquo event, which was the race of the day, with Robbie Nicholl from Dromore AC throwing down the gauntlet to all comers by opening up a considerable lead on the first lap and having it picked up by East Downrsquos Aaron Lennon who worked tremendously hard to close the gap as the finish line beckoned.Moving onto the shoulder of the now toiling Dromore lad, just as they turned into the home uphill straight, Aaron was not to be denied and he sprinted alongside and then pulled away from Robbie to win what was a tremendous duel in the sun and was a real heart warmer for everyone watching.Well done to both lads.This is a battle which could run and run and Irsquom already looking forward to the next instalment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Raphael.jpg","title":"Raphael thanks community for overwhelming support  ","story":"A LOCAL man has described the communityrsquos support for his annual Christmas appeal for DePaul and other charities as ldquoincredibly overwhelming.Raphael Mason recently spearheaded his sixth annual appeal for DePaul and also supported the Fountain Foodbank in Downpatrick, the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust in Belfast and Down Districtrsquos Home Start charity.The award-winning Ballykinlar photographer transported four van-loads of clothes, toiletries, foodstuffs and toys to the ious groups and said the response to his  appeal was by far the biggest ever.Raphael started helping the homeless following a chance meeting with a man living on the streets of Dublin in  with initial donations received going to DePaulrsquos annual Christmas Appeal in Dublin.The charity helps homeless people and those affected by homelessness and offers immediate and long-term support to people struggling to get by.This year, Raphaelrsquos appeal was widened to help several local charities and he was touched by the generosity of others, in particular, some whom would be regarded as not particularly well off but who responded to the Christmas message of goodwill to others.The Ballykinlar man was also generously supported by staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar who organised their own collection, with Raphael thrilled that they have come on board to help.ldquoThe donation from St Colmcillersquos HS last year was unreal. This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting. The generosity of spirit that local people have displayed since my first appeal continues to be overwhelming..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Red.jpg","title":"Red High back in business  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, booked their place in the MacLarnon Cup play-offs against Carndonagh Community School and are now just one win away from the quarter-finals.The holders didnrsquot start that well as St Louisrsquo grabbed the first two points through Aidan Scullion at the Dub last Wednesday, but as the first half progressed it became clear that St Patrickrsquos were the more accomplished team.Although St Louisrsquo still led at the break by - to -, the writing was on the wall for the mid-Antrim boys with the pace of the Downpatrick wing-forwards and wing-backs, plus the presence of Aodhan Harney, Tom Smyth and Ruairiacute Connor down the centre was always a problem for them.St Louisrsquo looked good in the opening few minutes with Scullion lively and Ruairiacute Hagan and Ryan McQuillan pushing forward, but that penetration was arrested before the end of the first quarter and the scores dried up.Their hopes of remaining in the tie against the strong breeze in the second half rested on a penalty in first half injury-time when Ronan McKillop fed Ryan McQuillan and the Glenravel man was taken down.But Scullion pulled his shot wide from the spot kick and that two points lead did not look good enough.Tom Smyth, Tom Savage, Chris McIlroy and Dermot Donaldson all pointed in the opening six minutes of the second half and the result was not in doubt from then on.Some of these were well taken scores, but the cream of the crop was a seven-player move down the left wing which finished with Conor Murray slinging over the second of his four second half scores in the nd minute.Six minutes later the Red High slammed the door shut on Ballymena.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences. The impact on consumers must be central to discussions on the future of heating, and cost and disruption minimisedsupport for climate change action is to be forthcoming.

If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt.

What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
