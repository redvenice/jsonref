But newly discovered papers reveal the polymath and former Observer writer had created different versions of this “arresting opening” for a book he hoped would establish him as a literary heavyweight.Researchers preparing for an online celebration of the novel’s publication in 1980 have uncovered rival first lines, including the alternative phrases: “It was the siesta-time of my eighty-first birthday”, and “our Moroccan butler announced that the Archbishop of Malta had come to see me”.The lost reference to Malta reflected an ongoing battle with censorship, according to Professor Andrew Biswell, director of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester, where the new documents were found.“This is all new, but it makes sense because the opening chapter takes place in 1971, when the real-life Archbishop of Malta was Mikiel Gonzi. Burgess had spoken out against the strict regime of Maltese state censorship, encouraged by Gonzi and the Catholic Church, which had banned a number of his own books, along with novels by Ian Fleming, Doris Lessing and Angela Carter,” said Biswell.In 1973 Burgess published an inflammatory public lecture, Obscenity and the Arts, and the Maltese government responded by confiscating his house on the island. The property was eventually returned to him after he leaked the story to the , but he left Malta, never to return.It is now clear his work on Earthly Powers, nominated for a Booker Prize when it eventually came out a decade later, had begun back in 1970, just ahead of the international notoriety that followed the release of Stanley Kubrick’s shocking film A Clockwork Orange, based on an earlier novel.Yet Earthly Powers is the book Burgess spent longest on, and it is the novel he cared most about, according to Biswell. “He talked about writing a novel of Tolstoyan or Dickensian scope and he carried the typed manuscript around from place to place, finally finishing it in the South of France,” he said.The book was hotly anticipated by publishers and the subject of a bidding war that ushered in the era of blockbuster fiction. “It was like a dress rehearsal for the great book publishing dramas of the 1980s, with Burgess revelling in his role in the spotlight,” said former Faber executive Robert McCrum.“I was offered publication rights from a rather shady literary agent, who was in Burgess’s pocket. I can remember an unwieldy typescript littered with Tippex corrections. It all got rather wild and I had to conceal from Faber (which had never participated in anything so vulgar as an auction) the sums that were being thrown around.”Hutchinson won the day with a counter bid of an unheard-of £40,000.“When William Golding’s Rites of Passage pipped Earthly Powers at the Booker ceremony a year later, it was a strange kind of poetic justice. Not that Burgess saw it that way, of course. He threw a hissy fit and refused to leave his suite at the Savoy,” recalls McCrum.The novel did, however, win a prestigious French prize for best foreign novel and it sold 100,000 hardback copies in America alone. Kirk Douglas, the star of Burgess’s favourite film Paths of Glory, even wanted to put it on as a one-man show on Broadway, but performance rights had already been sold to an Australian company.Work on the vast Burgess personal archive began after Liana, Burgess’s Italian translator and second wife, left the papers to the foundation on her death in 2007. The newly discovered Earthly Powers pages also reveal the author wanted another title for the work. Burgess hoped to call it The Instruments of Darkness, a quote from Shakespeare’s Macbeth, but this idea was abandoned when another writer, Alfred Price, brought out a history of radar with that title in 1977. Burgess’s final manuscript is titled The Prince of the Power of the Air, but in an early draft he calls the novel Not Peace but a Sword. The contract for the British edition, meanwhile, refers to the book as Absolute Power.The new papers will go online anthonyburgess.orgearthly-powers later this year, alongside a series of podcasts and an online public annotation project, aiming to solve the puzzles in the novel’s final text."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1f2a88da03aa47b8c7b60a6cd964d6f20939a9/0_133_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06d662296b2c23474e127bd55c2b5b53","title":"how england found itself at the foot of the covid 19 league table","story":"Excess deaths, the stats that really count, show that England is paying the price for poor governmentAs the data rolls in from the Covid-19 pandemic it is a bit like watching the football scores, but only for the teams at the wrong end of the table.The results for every country are poor: it’s simply that some appear to be doing worse than others. France saw bigger falls in output than Germany, Spain or Italy in the first three months of 2020: the US has seen the sharpest increase in unemployment.In truth, it is too early to make international comparisons. The UK took a smaller hit to activity than France in the first three months of the year but it went into lockdown later. There may be nothing more to it than that.Similarly, the jobless rate in the US is higher than in the UK for two reasons: the Americans get their unemployment figures out quicker and don’t have a furloughing scheme to soften the blow to the labour market.Making assumptions now about which country has fared least badly from the pandemic is no different from making rash predictions about which team will be relegated three games into the season. If the history of the last recession is any guide, the US will bounce back faster than the UK or the eurozone.Governments are sensitive to international economic comparisons, but they are even more prickly when it comes to mortality league tables. You don’t need to be a genius to understand why Boris Johnson has ceased to publish details of how well Britain is doing compared to the rest of the Europe. As Keir Starmer helpfully pointed out last week, you need to look no further than the fact that the UK has had more deaths than any other country.Ministers and health officials say that comparing the headline figures for deaths is misleading, and in one sense they are right. France has a lower death toll than Britain but that might be expected given that it has roughly the same number of people living in a country that is twice as big. Population density is clearly a factor when it comes to the spread of Covid-19.There is, though, a way to refine the data so that more meaningful international comparisons can be made. This is done by comparing a country’s excess deaths: the difference between the mortality rate this year with what happened in the past.This is what two Oxford University economists, Janine Aron and John Muellbauer, have done in a new paper. It shows England’s peak in excess deaths was not just higher than that in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland but the highest of 24 European countries.England also had the highest excess death rate for the over-65s and – perhaps even more worryingly – had far and away the worst record for excess deaths for those age between 15 and 64 as well. At its peak it was 2.8 times worse than the weekly peak in the next worst country, Spain, around four times worse than France and Belgium, and more than times worse than in Italy.These are sobering findings, particularly in the light of England coming out of lockdown faster than Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.As Aron and Muellbauer note, there are plenty of reasons why England’s excess death rate is so high. The first is the role of London as a major global hub, with a high population density and a transport system that makes social distancing difficult. London had the highest number of cases of Covid-19 in the early stages of the pandemic and it is not hard to see why.A second factor is that it took time for the government to decide a lockdown was necessary. By that time, the virus had taken hold and was being transmitted in London. By the time it reached less densely parts of the UK the lockdown had been enforced.Thirdly, the UK was in no fit state to deal with the crisis. The paper notes: “Generally, there was a collective failure in preparedness across the public health system, especially for testing capability and adequate supplies and distribution logistics of personal protection equipment for health workers.”The findings for the 15-64 age group need to be looked at alongside the government’s own data, which shows much higher Covid-19 related death rates in areas of economic deprivation. Underlying health tends to be worse in the poorer parts of the country, and they contain more low-paid employees who work in face-to-face sectors: care workers, bus drivers, supermarket cashiers.The Office for National Statistics has helpfully broken down deaths for England and Wales from Covid-19 by occupational group. Among men, security guards and care workers fare worst. Among women care workers have around 2.4 times the death rates of the average for working age women, suggesting they have been particularly let down by a lack of protective gear and by the failure to test, trace and isolate. The comparative ratio for nurses is 1.3 the average for working age women.Ministers don’t like to be reminded of it, but Germany has done far far better than the UK, and England in particular. Its decentralised model for testing was streets ahead of Britain’s top-down centralised approach. It had more hospital beds, more intensive care units and more ventilators per head of population. It started testing more quickly, which facilitated effective tracing. Investment in PPE occurred earlier and Germany did better than other countries to keep the virus out of care homes.One of the favourite sayings of football managers is that the table never lies. This one doesn’t either. The government’s handling of Covid-19 has been poor from the start and it is about time it was held to account for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97400d6e8b8d6afc180c32d7d640d318a4068ebf/238_0_3987_2393/master/3987.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=1c2acb1bf9e2e37f2243d6de352468b3","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of treasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘treasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘treasure’.Share your photos of what treasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 20 May at 10am.

In some families parents are working at night, or rising at 5am to sustain a struggling business before their children wake up. They may more urgently feel the need for schools to reopen than those who can happily juggle a few hours of homeschooling with working from home.But think about what primary teachers are facing with the prospect of suddenly going back to school with gaggles of five- and six-year-olds. As one infant teacher said on the radio this week: “We’ll have six classes back, so we need at least 12 classrooms, but only have nine. The government has admitted we can’t socially distance, so they’re playing with our health. We are taking the children’s toys away, because they have to be constantly cleaned, what will they do all day? I’ve got four pages of issues like this!”On the other hand, a headteacher on the same show said: “Sitting around saying it’s too hard is no model for our young people.” Solutions had to be found.Schools are now hurriedly buying washing troughs and putting up sanitiser stations. Marking parent drop-off areas. Deep-cleaning canteens. Children will play in chalked circles on playgrounds. For a moment it sounds doable. But then, a child coughs in a narrow corridor another falls and hurts his knee. He’s crying, it’s bleeding. A child with special needs requires help with feeding and there is no protective equipment. And what happens if there’s a fight?Now imagine: it’s your daughter, your husband, or your best friend who is teaching. Are you happy for them to jump into these situations? It is too easy to be dismissive about low potential harm unless it’s your loved one taking the risk. It is vital that trade unions question hard and push for the safest possible conditions before schools can reopen.Certainty on safety is not possible, though. The virus is still mysterious and new complexities may yet arise. The experts have admitted a vaccine may never come. But imagine: it is your home at risk because you can’t work, or your sanity dwindling from the 57th day of home schooling, or your six-year-old sobbing because they miss their friends. Your heart’s calculator may now calibrate the risks differently. Schools reopening, at least in some form, would be a lifeline. We need to be smart about this.In Italy, Spain and Ireland schoolchildren will not return until autumn at the earliest. Wales and Scotland are leaning the same way. Yet, in England, politicians are putting their efforts into fighting with the unions for an early return – and one that initially offers just three year groups a poor, socially distanced, in-a-school-but-not-really-school experience for, at best, six weeks before the end of term.Meanwhile, many parents will still be unable to work because they have a child in another year group stuck at home but now have the added complexity of a heavily sanitised school run on top of it all.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary in England, should stop looking for fights. Instead, he should pause, and focus schools on doing distance learning really well by setting minimum standards for the remainder of the academic year. It seems right, for example, that every child should speak with a teacher at least once a week and receive meaningful feedback on work they have completed during that time.Why this approach has been missed is not clear. The Department for Education’s own scientific adviser admits he hasn’t seen any modelling around reopening schools and says the evidence on transmission is mixed. Is this about getting people back to work, or is it a classic Conservative trick of fuelling union strife to ert public attention from government failings and aim it towards a profession with a well-protected salary?Whatever it is, it doesn’t seem to be about safety or learning. There are no easy answers but Williamson can find smarter solutions. The question is whether he has the courage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3445db5b02f61da1ce4266182de2bdf4c74c32fc/0_83_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cdff7b0cc8845d8b0d5cd148119f1d3","title":"teaching unions vow to work with ministers to reopen english schools","story":"NASUWT chief says he backs government’s 1 June timetable if schools can be made ‘Covid-secure’Teaching unions say they are willing to work with the government to begin reopening schools in England as long as it can be done safely, amid concerns about a renewed coronavirus outbreak.The debate over Boris Johnson’s decision to return some primary pupils to classrooms on 1 June has grown increasingly acrimonious after the British Medical Association (BMA) backed teaching unions who said the government was moving too quickly.Pressure on the unions increased after the children’s commissioner for England called on the two sides to “stop squabbling” and agree on a plan. Anne Longfield said she was in “despair” at the increasingly entrenched positions being taken by the two sides, and that the interests of children were being ignored. However, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT union, said members supported schools reopening provided they could be made “Covid secure” and it would not put public health at risk. Discussions between unions and government scientific advisers took place on Friday. However, the meeting was inconclusive and critics of the government’s plan said it raised more questions than answers.Roach said teachers needed unequivocal guidance from the government that there would be strong controls in place that would satisfy both teachers and parents that it was safe to return.“We are continuing to say to government but also to schools and employers, that we are here, we want to work with those employers to put plans in place to see whether schools can be ready for reopening from 1 June,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We want schools to be reopened, we want children to be safe and we want staff to be safe. It is not a zero-sum game here. It is about ensuring that we get back to a place where we can return to some form of normality.” Longfield said that until a vaccine was found there would have to be a managed approach to risk. “My worry within all that is that the needs of children and the best interests of children are disappearing from view,” she told Today. “There are really strong reasons why children need to get back into school. It is really imperative to see the can-do willingness to work together that we have seen in other parts of society.“None of us want to put children, or indeed staff or parents, into any kind of situation that is unsafe. But until we get a vaccine we are going to have to be managing risk.”Prof Sir Mark Walport, the chief executive of UK Research and Innovation and a former government chief scientific adviser, said ministers were taking a cautious approach and that a similar phased reopening in Denmark had not led to an increase in the transmission rate of the disease.“It is very harmful for children and complicated for families if their children aren’t in school,” he told Today. “It is clear that although children do get infected – and the evidence is that they are infected probably as often as older people – nevertheless they show less symptoms and almost certainly transmit less than older people. “Class sizes are being kept low, not all school years are going back, so it is being done in a very cautious fashion.” Meanwhile, another English council has publicly stated it would oppose the government’s timetable. Hartlepool borough council said: “Given that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, the council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday 1 June. “While we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this. We continue to work with schools to put in place appropriate measures to help keep children and staff safe when a phased reopening is possible.” Hartlepool’s statement followed confirmation that Liverpool’s schools would only be open to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers on 1 June.The BMA, the UK’s largest doctors’ union, said in a letter to the National Education Union on Friday that the number of coronavirus infections remained too high to allow them to run safely. Teaching unions had been “absolutely right” to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on 1 June, it said.“We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK,” the BMA council’s chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in the letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/293cf8e2172b6c1d8bae3f292de8b46cf88eef79/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=201cc38de8b11a88a13665ce49cf411b","title":"denmark can teach england safe reopening of schools covid 19","story":"Danish transition out of lockdown has become the model for Boris Johnson’s government as it tries to convince teachers to returnIn the week leading up to the reopening of Denmark’s schools a month ago, Dorte Lange spent a lot of time on Skype. The vice-president of the Danish Union of Teachers was responsible for detailed negotiations with the education minister, the health authorities and other teaching unions. The aim was to make sure that everyone was happy with the safety measures put in place to ensure an orderly return of younger pupils to classrooms on 15 April. “As unions, we were taken so much into account and we were consulted so much that we felt quite safe about this,” Lange says. “We said to our members that we think that we can actually trust the authorities and that it will be OK to go back.”The Danish transition from lockdown to a reopening of schools has become the go-to model for Boris Johnson’s government as it seeks to coax teachers and unions into going back to work from next month.“Schools have started to return in Denmark and have not seen a negative impact as a result of that,” the secretary of state for education, Gavin Williamson, told unions last week. “This has reconfirmed this approach is the right approach.”The Danish reopening has, so far, been smooth. The country’s R number rose briefly in the two weeks after pupils up to the age of 11 returned, creeping up from 0.7 to 0.9, but it has since fallen back. On Friday, the country passed a major milestone: the first day without a death from coronavirus since March. There were just 137 people being treated in hospital for coronavirus.The reopening of schools – which has seen classes split in two to keep two metres between each child, more lessons taught outside and a rigorous hand-sanitising regime – has not led to a spike in cases among staff. “We have seen very few incidents where teachers have become ill with coronavirus,” Lange says.But as well as being one of the first countries to reopen schools, Denmark was also one of the first to close them, with its prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, imposing a lockdown at least a week ahead of the UK.On 13 March, the day the Cheltenham Festival drew nearly 70,000 people, Denmark closed its borders. It had ordered schools to close two days earlier, and on 17 March, it closed restaurants, bars and most shops, limiting gatherings to 10 people. So, by the time primary schools reopened, the pandemic was already under control, with 200 people being treated in intensive care with coronavirus – about 3.5 for every 100,000 citizens.There is also a sharp contrast between the acrimonious handling of the negotiations in the UK and those that were held by Lange and others. While the UK government has been wary of sharing the scientific advice it receives, the process in Denmark began with the publication of a report from the country’s infectious diseases agency, SSI. This modelled the likely effect of reopening, based on the assumptions that children spread the infection at the same rate as adults and have no ability to socially distance. SSI concluded that, although the R number would increase, this was likely to lead to only 264 coronavirus patients in intensive care at any one time.Teachers’ unions accepted SSI’s conclusions and used them as the basis for the negotiations over guidelines. “We’re not scientists, we’re not professors of epidemiology, so we don’t know anything about that. We have to trust the authorities,” Lange says, adding, however, that she doesn’t blame her British counterparts for acting in the way they have.On Friday, she had another Skype call with Denmark’s education minister. This time, it was partly about the return of older pupils tomorrow, which will mean a return to more crowded classrooms. But it was also about how to retain some of the positive aspects of the school regime of the past month.“We can see now very clearly that smaller groups bring a higher degree of wellbeing for the kids, and give the teachers more contact with the kids during the day,” Lange says.“We are looking at whether we can continue that, and maybe shorten our school day a bit, with fewer lessons but with a higher degree of contact with students.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15781de78d89829c5638e962adc8d4616ec927c1/0_0_2040_1492/master/2040.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ece34767a182fe4e08d09e806842560a 1010w","title":"the orphanage review afghan drama bollywood shahrbanoo sadat","story":"A young boy copes with harsh life in 80s Afghanistan via the joy of cinema in this affecting taleThe setting is Kabul, 1989, and in the opening shot of this lean Afghan drama, a boy wakes up, cracks his knuckles and pulls on a well-scuffed pair of trainers, ready to face the new day. But what could have been a cliched opener is subtly subverted: his alarm call is the distant bark of dogs, the colour palette is the kind of arid, dusty ochre that makes your throat itch, and rather than a bed, the boy is waking on the back seat of an abandoned car on a stretch of fenced-off wasteland.The boy is 15-year-old street kid Qodra (Qodratollah Qadiri, who also appeared in Sadat’s previous film, Wolf and Sheep, to which this picture is a loose sequel). An abrupt edit transports us from the makeshift car park to the inside of a cinema. On the screen is the hokey Bollywood vigilante movie Shahenshah, starring a dashing Amitabh Bachchan. Crammed into the cheap seats, surrounded by animated men and boys, Qodra is transfixed by a fight sequence, eyes and teeth lit by the flicker reflected from Bachchan’s leather jacket and glistening, immaculate hair.It’s telling that the movie theatre is the first place that the film takes us after Qodra wakes. For this teenager and many of his peers, films, specifically crowd-pleasing Indian blockbusters, take priority over most of the essentials of life. They provide a much-needed escape from a hardscrabble existence, a means to make money (he peddles tickets on black market), and the language he uses to process the world. In its understated way, this film is as heartfelt a love letter to the power of the movies as Giuseppe Tornatore’s Cinema Paradiso.It’s the ticket touting that lands Qodra in trouble with the authorities. Pulled from the street along with a ragtag band of other teenage boys, he is taken to a state-run orphanage. There, his survival instincts kick in: Qodra quickly realises that, to negotiate the hierarchies and power structures within the institution, he is best off making himself invisible. Others are not so shrewd. Sixteen-year-old Fayaz (Ahmad Fayaz Osmani), who was brought to the orphanage along with his 14-year-old uncle Masihullah (Masihullah Feraji), is assigned a bunk in the room in which Eshan (Eshanullah Kharoti), the main bully, lords it with his crowing henchman. His red hair and emotional fragility mark Fayaz out as a target, and intimidation soon takes its toll.But Qodra’s reticence brings with it a specific challenge for the film-makers. Non-professional actor Qadiri has magnetism in the role, but his performance is inscrutable to the point of being unreadable. Sadat’s inventive solution to the problem elevates The Orphanage from a standard social-realist grind to something more original and endearing: Qodra’s interior life is vividly envisaged through the language of Bollywood musicals. Thus the first stirrings of a crush are reimagined as a coy duet, complete with his-and-hers matching knitwear, a seemingly random assortment of picturesque backdrops and a chaste campfire flirtation. Plaudits are due to cinematographer Virginie Surdej, who infuses the sequences with a layer of suitably synthetic kitsch, a striking contrast to the unvarnished immediacy of the rest of the film, which put me in mind of the work of Kurdish-Iranian director Bahman Ghobadi.It works rather well. The Bollywood segments provide sparky punctuation in a film that can feel slightly episodic and lacking in context and background texture. There’s a goofiness and naivety to Qodra’s flights of musical fancy, reminding us that, for all his well-honed survival instincts, he is a child with a narrow spectrum of experiences and a limited emotional vocabulary with which to process them. Tenderness, grief, vulnerability are all easier to understand when filtered through the lush lens of Bollywood.Other boys choose other means of escape. Qodra’s friend Masihullah is a chess whiz. In two separate, intensely concentrated scenes, he triumphs at the game. The first results in an explosion of joy, the second of violence.Some things, however, are beyond the comprehension of the children: they are perplexed by an announcement heralding a change in the government – the pro-Soviet regime of Najibullah has been toppled and the boys must gather together for burning any documents that link the institution to the government. At this point, the focus shifts slightly to Anwar, the tough but fair orphanage supervisor, played by Anwar Hashimi (on whose unpublished diaries both this film and Wolf and Sheep are based). Anwar’s anxiety, carved in hard angles on his face, hints at danger to come. But it’s another Bollywood fantasy, a glorious battle between the orphanage kids and a rabble of mujahideen, that foretells a darker chapter about to open for the boys, who will soon find themselves on the frontline of a devastating civil war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c386af4915758090c059985ff17f29aaa53f461/0_281_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1701526619acfb05df741b7d6bb5c2d","title":"daydreaming of your first meal out after lockdown it is going to be french","story":"Well, quelle surprise, it’s most likely to be French. Jay Rayner explores our enduring love affair with the cuisine of France If you attempted, in these shrunken times, to discern the nation’s tastes by thumbing through takeaway food apps, you might conclude that we adore anything as long as it’s got a dough base, is tottering in a bun, or drenched in sriracha. I’m not complaining. I like all these things. I am often to be found up to my unshaven armpits in sriracha. But one thing is noticeable on these apps by its rarity: French food.There may be something generational going on here that the demographic using Deliveroo, Uber Eats and the rest simply doesn’t go hunting through the digital meadows for a good cassoulet when they’re hungry. Also, many French classics are far less portable than Korean chicken wings. Soupe à l’oignon, complete with a crouton and gruyère lid, in a plastic box, may well arrive looking like a Portaloo on the third day of Glastonbury.But there’s something else. A takeaway Chinese is a domestic ritual the grammar of which we understand. We associate French food with a restaurant experience. For many of us – and yes, this may also be generational – what comes to mind first when we hear the word “restaurant” is the classic French bistro. There will be checked tablecloths. There will be wooden chairs, with more than a hint of art nouveau in the spindle curves of their backs. There will be wine and a plate of something that speaks not just to appetite but also to memory.That vivid, erse takeaway offering is exactly what we’d want to see in a vivid, erse society like ours. What’s surprising is just how sturdily the French restaurant has endured in the midst of it. Recently, I scanned back through 20 years of reviews. The first column which brought me feedback was about three months into the job in 1999. It was of a bistro in Brighton called La Fourchette, where they served a nage de poissons full of mullet, crab and mussels in an intense liquor the colour of a leather-bound book. I received sheaths of handwritten letters cooing over that one.The last restaurant I reviewed before the lockdown was the Flying Frenchman La Canteen, with its terrines, cassoulet and crème brûlée. Aided by the convenience of the digital, the response was even more clamorous. In between there has been a constant Gallic twang: a rabbit and langoustine terrine at Purslane in Cheltenham, an ox cheek bordelaise at the Honours in Edinburgh, plentiful duck confit at Comptoir Gascon in London’s Smithfield, and so very much more. I have measured out my life, very happily, in daubes and rum babas.Many of my close friends, asked where they want to go first after lockdown, mention Brasserie Zedel in London’s Soho, a faithful homage to the Parisian brasseries, which opened in 2012, and which serves a cracking steak haché and choucroute garnie to a 350-seater dining room that was rarely empty. It’s not just the food. It’s, oh, the everything.I could give you the history now. I could take you through the arrival of the Huguenots in the 16th century, and the impact of the French revolution on the cooking in England’s grand houses in the 18th. I should mention Auguste Escoffier at the Savoy. There must be a nod to L’Escargot, which once had a snail farm in the cellar, and of course, Mon Plaisir, one of London’s oldest French restaurants, marked by its flamboyantly large tricolour.Instead, I want to cut straight to the important stuff. Obviously, that’s Robin’s Nest, the spinoff sitcom from Man About the House, starring Richard O’Sullivan as the languorous Robin Tripp. It ran for 48 episodes from 1977 to 1981. Robin’s Nest did indeed have checked tablecloths and curving-backed wooden chairs, plus a stuffed bear. Most importantly its chef patron was the uber-modern 70s male: at ease with himself and his tastes. Which meant he was great in the kitchen. Which meant, like a Len Deighton spy, he could cook French food.“I think we all had the idea then, that the French knew what to do with food and we didn’t,” co-writer Brian Cooke told me when I asked why Tripp’s restaurant was a French bistro. “Plus, in Man About the House, Tripp had always said he wanted a little French restaurant, so we gave him what he wanted.” In the first episode Tripp convinces his girlfriend’s father, played by Tony Britton, to invest in the bistro by cooking him a roast leg of “d’agneau nouvelle saison et pommes sarladaises”.Cooke and his co-writer, Johnnie Mortimer, had sniffed the air and understood which way British society was moving. Within a decade, the UK’s modern restaurant boom would kick off, with four key openings in 1987. One, the River Café at Thames Wharf, served Italian peasant food priced for plutocrats. Two more were avowedly French: Bibendum, in Chelsea, with Simon Hopkinson at the stove, was all the classics – escargot, steak au poivre, chocolate pithiviers for dessert – done as well as possible. Meanwhile, at Harveys in Wandsworth, Marco Pierre White was knocking out high-end French food with a box-shouldered 80s gloss. The fourth restaurant was Kensington Place, where Rowley Leigh was famed for his modern European menu. But even that included a jellied daube of beef and a chicken and goat’s cheese mousse, which couldn’t be more French if the writers of The Simpsons were in charge of the stereotypes.Henry Harris has spent much of his career gifting us rugged French food. He was part of the original brigade at Bibendum, then had his own restaurant, Racine. He now oversees a London pub group where the menu can include rillettes and rabbit in mustard sauce. When I called him, he had just put the makings of a rillette in the oven at home. I asked him to describe the appeal of the French restaurant. “I always direct people to the French word ‘restauration’, meaning to restore, from which the word restaurant comes. Of course, a good bistro delivers great dishes, but it’s the other bits: a decent napkin, a white plate, a good glass for wine. It’s a hello from the manager. I’m here to look after you and make sure you leave happier than when you came in.”These things are obviously not exclusive to the French restaurant. And in Paris the waiters can sometimes compete for an Olympic gold in rudeness. But the British French restaurant is something else. It’s a place designed, in our imagination, to convince us everything is going to be OK. Unsurprisingly, that’s what many of us crave right now. For the moment though I’ll just have to make do with old episodes of Robin’s Nest.A group of over two dozen hospitality business leaders, led by Alan Lorrimer of the Piano Works live music bars, has written to the government calling for a relaxation of licensing and zoning laws to enable the creation of what they are calling a Grand Summer Outdoor Café in the UK’s cities. The proposal is based on an initiative in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, which has launched a vast outdoor seating plan, across pavements and squares, enabling customers to have physically distanced drinks and meals.The Cartford Inn, at Little Eccleston in Lancashire, has launched TOTI – short for Taste Of The Inn – at home. They are offering a changing set of menus for the long weekend, with delivery, which is free if the address is within a short distance of the pub. Thursday is burger night and for Sunday lunches there’s a roast. The menu for Friday and Saturday includes the likes of corned beef fritters with brown sauce and crisp onions, and their much loved – by me – braised oxtail and beef suet pudding. Orders must be placed in advance.

Slap them on a hot grill. Salad needs the merest tweak, a smidgen of vinegary oil and salt. But turning flour into bread needs effort, time, alchemic fiddling by enzymes, carbonates, yeasts and microflora while prodding and twisting its lumpen shape into respectable life.Though we might boast that simple bread is all we need for a well-fed life, we also know – deep down – that creating that “simple bread” requires more labour and skill than, say, the heralded steak and salad it’s quietly placed beside on the plate.Normally our lives appear too hectic to take on some recipes, when we know really that they’re no match for the convenience of eating out or a delivery. Take the flour-to-bread challenge. Buying a baking book is a little like investing in that gym membership that starts with the best intentions then peters out when our weekends disappear under emails, unfinished chores and promises to meet with friends. So tackling the bag of flour in the cupboard is continually put off.Until we reach the point we’re at now, mid 2020, when time is the one thing we do have. My guess is that, in this sad and frightening coronavirus wave, these longed-for skills offer some ballast to stop us falling completely.Learning to roll a wheat tortilla that verges on parchment, or to turn a bubbling bowl of sourdough into a prized loaf, or to make buttery cornbread or a scruffy soda bread gaining these skills helps distract and focus our minds when the world outside isn’t providing the usual joy.For most of us, our first befuddled effort fills us with chest-banging pride and be damned anyone who doubts what they see in our first loaf. And, in trying it, we’ve ticked off one of life’s easier complexities, not exactly wrestling tigers but, in kitchen terms, braving the floury beast head on. Giving us the feeling that should our world fall apart we can manage to take the plainest ingredient and create a dazzling meal.Here are two recipes that can be effortlessly stirred and baked in little more than an hour, giving you a skillet bursting with golden cornbread or a slab of oat soda bread.Because quick breads like these are, in my book, the swiftest path to baking pride.This is the original quick-and-easy, no-knead bread to serve alongside ice-cold oysters and stout or a glass of ale. For a change, I’ve made this with the coarse oatmeal you get in tins. More expensive, I know. But it gives the bread the best chewy texture and would have been traditional before rolled oats (an American invention from the late 1800s) were widely available in the British Isles. For this recipe I make a sort of porridge and beat the other ingredients through it. It’s baked in a tin, as the mixture is a bit sloppy. In Ireland I’ve only ever seen soda bread as a slab and to me that’s much easier to cut and use.coarse or pinhead oatmeal 100gwater 225mlbutter or dripping 30g, plus extra for the tinlow-fat plain yogurt 100gcold milk 200mlbrown sugar 1½ tbspwholemeal or spelt flour 325gbicarbonate of soda 1½ tsp fine salt ¾ tspPlace the oatmeal and water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil then remove from the heat, stick the lid on and leave for an hour, adding the butter towards the end. Whisk in the yogurt, milk and sugar until smooth and free of lumps.Butter an 18–20cm square cake tin and line the base with a square of non-stick baking paper, and heat the oven to 180C fangas mark 6. Stir the flour, bicarb and salt into the oatmeal mixture until smooth. Spoon the batter into the tin, cover the top with foil, bake for 15 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for a further 30 minutes until the crust is a good rich brown.The southerners in America like their cornbread made with white cornmeal and lots of it, without any sweetness, whereas in the northern states they like it yellow and fluffy with a little sugar. The small amount of flour used here moderates the chewiness and gives a lighter texture, but with yellow cornmeal and some sugar to add sweetness and a golden colour. Bacon fat is the traditional thing to stir into the mix and rub around the pan, a “must” if you have it, but butter and oil are easier to get hold of. Sliced thinly it’s the perfect accompaniment for hot spicy pork ribs and a bowl of fresh homemade coleslaw.oil or bacon fat to grease the tinpolenta or coarse yellow cornmeal 225gstrong white flour 75gfine salt 1 tspbicarbonate of soda 1 tspcaster sugar 50glow-fat plain yogurt 475geggs 2, mediummelted butter or more bacon fat 25gGet a round ovenproof skillet or baking dish about 20cm in diameter and pour a few tablespoons of oil into it, rubbing a little up the sides to stop the mixture sticking. Place the skillet in the oven and heat it to 180C fangas mark 6.Spoon the polenta, flour, salt, bicarb and sugar into a bowl and mix them together. In another bowl, beat the yogurt with the eggs and melted butter. When the skillet is hot, remove it from the oven and place it on the stovetop. Beat the yogurt mixture evenly through the dry ingredients, and quickly spoon the mixture into the hot skillet. Smooth the top gently then place it back in the oven and bake for 20–25 minutes until it starts to pull away from the sides of the tin. The top won’t have coloured much but the base should be a deep golden brown. Remove from the oven then leave to cool slightly before turning out onto a serving plate.

I could have used them up in a seeded fruit cake, but what felt more useful right now was a recipe within reach of anyone, maybe someone who has never cooked before. A recipe that won’t mind if you mix and match the ingredients according to what’s left in the cupboard. Which is why I dug out Mum’s flapjack recipe, the first thing I ever cooked with her a recipe that in addition to being up for a few additions from the store cupboard, carries with it the warm scent of butter and golden syrup and baking oats and tells you, almost more than any other, that everything is going to be all right.I am currently rather grateful for these sort of recipes, the ones that are happy with a bit of give and take. The type of cooking that is cool with a cook’s “more or less” attitude to weights and measures. In particular, I appreciate recipes that allow you to make substitutions when ingredients won’t come to hand.Another straightforward dish, this time of the spring dinner kind, is one of baked chicken cooked with stock and then any vegetables you have around. My first was a rather seasonal mix of peas and lettuce, yet I could have used tender-leaved early chard or broad beans. I used stock that I had around, but I could have embellished it with ease – upending the dregs of a bottle of white vermouth into the stock would have added interest without overwhelming the green spring flavours. The green olives I dropped in at the last minute brought a welcome salty, slightly bitter quality, but I could have easily used a few capers or tiny cornichons. If none had been available I may have resorted to a splash of tarragon vinegar and an even more generous pinch of salt.The lettuce leaves take on a silky texture in the oven, with the stems retaining something of their crispness. Cos and little gem are the most suitable, the exceptionally fragile leaves of the round butterhead variety probably less so. Serves 2olive or vegetable oil 3 tbspchicken thighs 4, largeleeks 200gchicken or vegetable stock 1 litrelettuce 2, little gem or similargreen olives 12peas 300g (shelled or frozen weight)parsley or chervil a small handfulWarm the oil in a deep, ovenproof pan, then add the chicken pieces, skin side down and lightly seasoned, and cook until the skin is a rich golden colour. Turn them and colour the underside similarly, then remove from the pan and set aside.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Trim the leeks, discarding any tough, dark leaves. Cut them into short pieces about the length of a wine cork, then wash thoroughly, removing every grain of grit trapped between their layers.Pat the leeks dry, then fry them in the chicken pan over a moderate heat, so they soften without browning. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil, stirring as you go, then return the chicken to the pan. Place in the oven and bake for 25 minutes.Wash the lettuce and cut each head in half from root end to leaf tip. Remove the chicken from the oven and tuck the lettuce around it, then add the olives. Tip in the peas and return to the oven for another 20 minutes.Check the seasoning, then add any small herb leaves and serve in bowls, with spoons for the broth.Use whatever appropriate seeds you have to hand, but in the interests of texture I try to use a mixture of sizes. For this batch I used an equal weight of large pumpkin and sunflower seeds, with just 10g each of diminutive linseed and sesame. If you use only large seeds the flapjacks may well fall apart. The mixture of dried fruits I used was roughly equal amounts of golden sultanas, dried cherries, mulberries and candied orange peel, but I could have used apricots, raisins or dried cranberries.You will also need a shallow baking tin – a roasting tin will do – about 22cm x 24cm, lined with baking parchment. Makes 12Melt the butter in a deep saucepan. Set the oven at 170Cgas mark 3. Add the golden syrup to the melted butter then stir in the sugar and let it melt.Stir both sizes of oats into the melted butter and sugar together with a generous pinch of salt. Remove the pan from the heat, then stir in dried fruits, nuts and seeds.Tip the mixture into the baking tin and gently smooth the surface level, but do not compress or compact the mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. The flapjack is done when it starts to turn a darker gold around the edges. The centre should be firm and springy to the touch.Remove the tin from the oven and, if you wish, score, without cutting right through, into 12 rectangular pieces. I prefer to break mine into rough pieces of assorted sizes as they cool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aad048570536fc8de7b44651fba0b6cbc6cf794/0_46_5108_3066/master/5108.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ae72688c54600318c25e7c67dc796d11","title":"beans three ways a trio of recipes for your store cupboard staple","story":"As a nation it’s safe to say we are baked bean lovers, and for years families have been passing on their unique bean recipes. Anna Masing serves up three fresh dinner ideas and gets the family stories behind the recipesYou can’t beat mopping up that delicious sauce with a piece of bread after a fry-up. But beans have moved on from the cooked breakfast. People proudly boast about their personalised recipes and each generation adds a new twist to a family favourite. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, there’s always room for beans on our plate.With increasing health concerns about the reduction of sugar in our diet, Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz lets this comfort food become a convenient staple for health-conscious people. Here are three recipes built from love and tradition for you to try.Recipe developer and food editor Nadine Brown makes this dish for her family – her partner, her eight-year-old daughter and two-year-old niece: “It’s perfect for a hungry family with little patience,” she says.The dish is based on a recipe Brown developed a few years ago, but with tweaks made specifically for her family. Beans have always been a favourite in their house: “They taste great on their own or in a dish like this,” Brown explains. “The basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,” she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: “It helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.”This dish is also about ease – it’s a “bung it all in one” dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown’s household, when they don’t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way.Ingredients8 pork sausages4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed1 tbsp olive oil2 red onions, cut into wedges1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz30g basil leaves, roughly torn300g cherry tomatoes on the vineFreshly cracked black pepperCrusty bread to serveMethodPreheat your oven to 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6.Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil.

Roz explains: “My mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.” For Zoe’s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. “Mum has the recipe nailed so it’s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband’s palate.”This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: “A rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum’s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house.“When discussing this recipe with Mum,” Zoe says, “she revealed its greatest quality – using what you have.” Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards – especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans.A store cupboard classic this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe. Without the optional bacon, it works as a main dish for vegetarians, and without the wine and chilli, it’s a great supper for kids.Preparation: 10 minutesCooking time: 20 minutesTotal time: 30 minutesServes: 4 as a light meal or 6 as a starterIngredients1 large red onion, chopped3 garlic cloves, crushed2 medium carrots, dicedHalf a red pepper, diced1 400g tin chopped tomatoes1 415g tin of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz1 handful of orzo or similar small pastaSaltfreshly ground pepperParmesan cheese (including rind)1 tsp Heinz tomato ketchup1 tbsp light olive oilA pinch of dried mixed herbs1 bay leaf1 small red chilli or a small pinch of chilli flakes (optional)125ml wine (red or white) or 2 dsp dry vermouth (optional)4 rashers of streaky bacon (optional)MethodSweat the onion, carrot and pepper gently in the oil for about 5 minutes.

This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: “My parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad’s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.”This has stood him in good stead – on a lads’ getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip.Rehncy’s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house a memory he has is his father’s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist – onions, spices and chillies – the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. “When you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,” says Rehncy. “I chose these spices because they’re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household – classics.”He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl!Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not.Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz)2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 white onion (finely diced)4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped)2 green chilli (finely chopped)1 tsp turmeric1 tsp cumin powder1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp coriander powder1 tsp garam masala powderSmall bunch of fresh corianderMethodAdd the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds begin to pop (you’ll hear little popping sounds), add the onion.Once the onion has started to soften, add in the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook down until the onion starts to brown slightly.Add in the cumin seeds and gently cook for another 2 minutes.Add the spices – turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Cook these down on a medium to low heat for a couple of minutes just to take the harshness out. Once you see the oil separating from the “masala mix” you can now add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz.Fold in the beans with the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed through and coated.

Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

My mum used to bake bread. I can still remember waking up to the smell of her amazing little crusty rolls. We’d have them with crispy bacon, eggs and baked beans and that was just a little plate of joy to start the day. I can still taste it when I think about it.Mum’s from Antigua and beans are also a big part of Caribbean cooking. Rice and peas, which is really rice and beans, is one of my favourite things. It’s so comforting, it’s like the Caribbean version of mashed potatoes. Then you put curried goat or chicken or fried fish on it – or just more beans. If you’re tired or lonely, sad or happy – whatever it is – rice and peas will generally sort it out.These days I’ve become more aware of sugar in dishes. A honey glaze here, something else there and, before you know it, you’ve pushed the sugar levels way up. For me it’s all about balance now. And low-sugar products are great for that.You can also bring out sweetness using existing foods on your plate, for example when you’re cooking your onions or leeks, let them go for longer because they create their own sweetness as they caramelise. It takes a while to adjust to that different kind of sweetness but it really works. Or add some cumin and a little salt to carrots and roast them to enhance their sweetness.It’s no surprise to me that beans are such a mainstay of so many cultures. Brazil has feijoada – black beans and pork stew. Families come together and add farofa, a toasted cornmeal, to it. And think of pasta e fagioli in Italy. There’s a familiar heartiness that beans evoke for me and historically they’re a food that people without much money could afford.We see them as humble but forget how versatile they are. They’re a brilliant carrier of flavour and add real depth and ballast to a plate. They’re a kind of security food. When I became a mother, I’d send my kids to school on beans on toast because I knew it was going to last and fill them the right way. My daughter Miquita was also a big fan of my cheesy baked beans. It was a kind of Welsh rarebit with a bit of Worcester sauce, all bubbling under the grill with silky beans and crusty bread underneath.The most exciting thing in cooking is when you take something people think of as humble and transform it into something really delicious and surprising. People forget the ways they can use the tin of beans in the cupboard – they’re haricots in tomato sauce, which is the basis of so many dishes. That’s why I came up with this recipe, which combines pork and beans – an age-old combination. Watch any cowboy film and that’s what they’re eating.In this dish, I use tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz to pair with the pork the creaminess of the beans and the salty, spiciness of the pork just makes me really happy. Then you get amazing sweetness from the leek and garlic running through it all.A hearty recipe that’s bound to satisfy – if you’re making it for kids you can go easy on the chilli.

Take the pork belly, slip it into an ovenproof dish, rub in all the spices, then pour in the stock. Cover with tinfoil, and place in the oven for at least 90 minutes, and up to 120 minutes – the meat needs to be very tender so that when you test with a skewer or small knife it is soft. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a board or rack to cool it down. Reserve the cooking juices left in the pan as well. Take the meat and pull it apart or roughly chop it up. As with the juices, leave to one side.Take a good heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter, add the oil, then all of the other ingredients except the beans. Soften the ingredients very gently over a low heat for about 40 minutes, until they are very soft and caramelised. Add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, pour in the cooking juices from the pork belly.

Crisp and crunchy fish and chips, juicy burgers on the barbecue and decadent chocolate brownies are simply too much of a temptation, no matter that you’ve promised to be good this week. But you don’t have to choose between health and hankering after a little indulgence: we’ve rewritten the cookbook to give five comfort foods a healthier summer makeover.Using simple swaps we’ve reduced the salt, sugar and fat content of some of our favourite family meals, as well as increasing the vitamin and mineral content with a few extra portions of veg. What’s more – there’s no compromise on flavour.Here’s how to have your cake and eat it (and your chips, and your fry-up …).Healthier burger and chips Adding grated carrot or courgette to your favourite burger recipe is a savvy way to cut the fat content and increase your daily veg intake – and it keeps burgers moist on the barbecue too.Grate the vegetables finely, squeeze out as much liquid as you can, and stir in to lean mince, adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and an egg to hold it all together. Cook the burgers on the barbecue, a griddle or in a frying pan, depending on the weather, and pile them up with plenty of tomatoes, crunchy lettuce and pickles.For healthier chips, cut large potatoes into thick fingers, boil them for four minutes and then roast in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil for 30 minutes or until golden. Less grease, less guilt – and lots of grinning faces around the table.Start by roasting sausages with sliced red onion, small cubes of sweet potato and a drizzle of oil in a hot oven. After about 20 minutes, or when the potatoes soften and the sausages are almost cooked through, add baby tomatoes on the vine, a handful of sliced flat-cap mushrooms and a few thyme sprigs, and bake for another 10 minutes. Make eight small gaps in the tray crack eggs into four of the holes and spoon Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz into the others, then bake for four minutes until the egg whites are set and the beans are warmed through. Serve with toast and a pot of tea.Feelgood fish and chipsReplace your normal fish-batter recipe with this healthier egg-based version – it’s salt free and cooks well in the oven. Not only are you increasing the protein content of this family favourite but by avoiding the deep-fat fryer you’ll cut down the fat content considerably.Whisk one egg white until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the broken yolk, adding lemon zest and finely chopped parsley. Dip two cod fillets into the egg-white batter and bake at 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6 for 15 minutes until the batter is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Serve with healthier oven-cooked chips, see recipe above, and minty crushed peas or with a big green salad.Guilt-free chocolate browniesIt’s a universal fact that the ultimate chocolate brownie should be dense and fudgy on the inside, with a slightly crisp top for complete satisfaction. The big secret is that this can be achieved without a lot of butter and sugar!Tinned black beans or sweet potato work wonderfully in chocolate brownies, as they have a natural sweetness and a fudgy texture that stands up to the dark chocolate. For black bean brownies, replace the butter with a tin of beans and a little oil. And replace the sugar with maple syrup. For the sweet potato option, use two large sweet potatoes cooked and mashed and 14 dates to replace the butter and sugar respectively.A more unusual substitution is mayonnaise. Swap out butter for your favourite low cal mayo and you’ll get the same rich, gooey brownie but with less fat and fewer calories.Alternative beans on toastYes, beans on toast covered in melted cheese can solve most of your problems, but there are healthier ways to get the same hit. This baked-bean quesadilla is a fun, Mexican twist on a teatime treat and has all the beany-cheesy goodness but less sugar, salt and fat. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz count as one of your five a day, and they’re naturally low in fat, with no added sugars, artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, which makes them a healthier alternative for all the family.Heat up a portion of the beans and then microwave two wholewheat flour tortillas for 15 seconds, or until warm. Spoon the hot beans over one tortilla using a slotted spoon so you don’t get too much sauce (no one wants soggy tortillas), and mash the beans lightly with a fork. Sprinkle with low-fat feta cheese, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, then put the other tortilla on top. Cut into four and serve with a big green salad, and a slightly smug feeling on the side.While you might not be able to stop the cravings, you can transform your food with a few healthy swaps – like using Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, sneaking in some extra vegetables, or getting creative with your cooking.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f0c7bea1433f837bcacc5cf7ba7a0216d6dac85/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fff387016cfba52a15b2a69c1dda02dc","title":"picking up the pieces the great jigsaw revival","story":"With time on our hands, jigsaws are having their moment. But what’s the appeal? And why are they so hypnotic? Richard Godwin speaks to puzzlers, creators and scientists to see the bigger pictureThe darkness was all-consuming as we reached the midpoint of our journey, blackness and confusion all around. It had already taken us two days to make it to the forest. At a certain point, we looked up and realised our child was no longer with us, lost amid the shimmering foliage. “Teddy, where are you?” my wife called. “Forget him, he was only slowing us down,” I murmured, perceiving the dim shape of a branch through the leaves.But there is always a way through – if not the colour, then the shape will guide you. Backs aching, eyes narrowing, language stripped to pure function, we began to piece together the blackest sections of the puzzle. “This is a waste of life,” my wife eventually concluded and returned to her novel. The glory would be mine alone. By midnight on the eighth day, the 500-piece Super-3D holographic jigsaw of the Hogwarts Express was complete.Yes, this was technically a sixth birthday present for our Harry Potter-mad son. Yes, we did most of it while he watched Netflix. Yes, I’m aware 500 pieces is not that many. Yes, this was a decadent amount of time to work on something so pointless. But sometimes, pointlessness is precisely the point.John Lewis is almost puzzled dry. Among its best sellers are The World of Frida Kahlo by Laurence King and Rainbow Hand by Galison. The satirical montage artist Cold War Steve has one, too, inspired by The Festival of Brexit – but this too has sold out. Wentworth, the Wiltshire-based company whose wooden fine art puzzles are highly prized by collectors, has nothing over 250 pieces.But puzzle junkies no longer care where they score their hit. “I don’t think I’d buy one of those super-twee ones of a country cottage or anything,” says Liz Vater, director of the Stoke Newington Literary Festival, who has completed four puzzles since lockdown, including a David Bowie-themed moon scene. “But if someone gave me one like that, I don’t think it would matter.” The experience is common. Jigsaws are a gateway drug to twee. You start out on a nice New Yorker cover. Soon, it’s Teddy Bears \u0026amp Tricycles.“You don’t want masses of sky or sand,” says my Granny Rose, 90, and a lifelong puzzler. “You want it to be interesting.” She grew up on jigsaws – her father only let her and her sister look at the picture once – and usually has one on the go. She likes doing them with friends or family, but in lockdown, she is on her own, working on an image of Blackpool beach that a friend dropped round. “It’s ghastly!” she laughs. “But my other jigsaws are in a high cupboard and I don’t want to risk climbing up on a chair.”It’s not too hard to see why we’re reaching for jigsaws. Margaret Drabble wrote a memoir inspired by puzzles, The Pattern in the Carpet: A Personal History With Jigsaws. “They provide hours of painless social intercourse or moments of peaceful, solitary retreat,” she wrote. “They give you an illusion of order and progress when all around is chaos.” There is such a thing as competitive puzzling, but this is not the point, Drabble argued. Here is a “harmonious, constructive, co-operative activity, free of the rivalry that makes so many games contentious and so many children so cross.” And if you want to do it on your own, while listening to a podcast or the birds singing, that’s fine, too.There have been studies into the cognitive effects of jigsaws. One concluded that the activity “recruits multiple visuospatial cognitive abilities and is a protective factor for visuospatial cognitive aging”. But it’s possible to overthink this. Dr Abigael San of the British Psychological Society sees it as a classic mindful activity. “Focusing on detail, taking the time to relax, having an aim without pressure – all of those things are beneficial and a counter to the wider anxiety that people are feeling at the moment. It gives you a sense of control in a chaotic situation. The world is unpredictable, whereas a jigsaw puzzle is certain.” As long as no one has lost a piece.The jigsaw is thought to have been invented in 1766 by John Spilsbury, an engraver and mapmaker whose “dissected maps” were used to teach. Jane Austen included a jigsaw in Mansfield Park (1814). The Bertram children laugh at poor cousin Fanny as she is not familiar with these fashionable toys. Adult puzzles emerged in the 20th century. At first all the pieces had straight edges. My granny remembers the “two spinsters” who lived next door to her had one like this – finally completed by the evacuee who came to stay during the war. She also remembers dedicated jigsaw libraries – of which I can find only one in England, based in a Baptist church in Exeter. Social distancing has forced it to close during lockdown. “Our clientele is usually quite elderly – people with time on their hands,” says its chairperson, Susan Hazemore. “It’s good for their eye-hand co-ordination. We have a few people who suffer from dementia and also insomnia, too. I don’t think we’ll be open until at least September now, but I am hoping that when I can go out and about a bit, I can do some delivering to people who are on our books.”For many, lockdown has been a foretaste of retirement. “Life doesn’t usually warrant a 1,000-piece jigsaw,” says Liz Vater – who realised she would have to cancel her literary festival early on and so found herself with time on her hands. “At the beginning, I had so many plans,” she says. “I was going to read all the books I have around the house. And I just wasn’t able to read. It was horrible. I always have a book on the go. But then I started a jigsaw. It does a similar thing. I was focusing in. It was quite meditative. I was processing as I was going. I’ve loved the endless hours just focusing on one task, searching for pieces defined by colour, perspective or shape.”One thing we have learned is that global catastrophes don’t introduce brand new ideas, what they do is accelerate ones that were already floating around the ether: universal basic income modern monetary theory jigsaw puzzles. When I interviewed Sir Patrick Stewart in Los Angeles three years ago, he was adamant that jigsaws were about to become the new “adult colouring books”. We were supposed to be talking about some superhero movie he was in, but he was more interested in telling me about the Picasso chair he was piecing together. “At first I was a little embarrassed about it, as it was something I’d done as a kid,” he told me. “But when I would occasionally mention it, people would whisper: ‘Oh, you do jigsaw puzzles, too? What kind? How many pieces?’ It’s like a secret society.”Goodburn of Gibsons says that jigsaws have been on a steady uptick since she joined the firm five years ago. There is a jigsaw emoji. Jigsaws were also added to the Consumer Price Index used to measure inflation in 2017 (alongside gin and almond milk). “It pre-dates coronavirus,” she says. “It’s part of the trend of looking after yourself, being more mindful, taking a digital detox.” Nostalgia is popular across age groups – one of their bestsellers is called 1980s Sweet Memories, a montage of Marathons, Opal Fruits and Jelly Tots – but they have also commissioned a new range of design-led jigsaws with a hipper audience in mind. “We have one called Avocado Park. It’s just a load of cartoon avocados having a great time in a park.”You can tell a lot about a nation by its jigsaw designs. Cats are popular. So are Spitfires. And the manically detailed, Union Jack-filled designs that Gibsons commissions often veer close to the sort of art you can imagine coming out of a Faragist dictatorship. Populist Realist Art? I ask the Observer’s art critic Laura Cumming for her verdict on The Airshow, which shows gleeful picnickers beneath a sky heavy with warplanes. She professes herself a little baffled. “The vintage planes would scalp the day-trippers, the photo-real detail seems bizarrely mismatched with the graphic kitsch and it is very strange that the hardest part of a jigsaw – long stretches of barely differentiated colour, such as sand, sea or sky – are eliminated as if the artist wanted the experience to be quick and easy. Is the idea to get through them as fast as possible and buy the next?” She reckons Pieter Bruegel the Elder is a good jigsaw artist as “you enter so intimately into his mind, piece by piece but I think Seurat is the most beautiful to do, half a dot, a whole dot, etc, as you get a deep sense of his colour alchemies. The worst I’ve ever had to do, in company with my aunt, was Renoir’s Bal du Moulin de la Galette, where every stroke melted into another.”I turn to Steve Crisp, one of the UK’s most in-demand jigsaw illustrators. “I’ll sort of do half a painting before moving on to computer, where it’s easier to move things around,” he explains. “The brief is basically, make every area of the puzzle interesting. Make sure there’s no area with too much foliage or blue sky. At the very least, there’ll be birds everywhere. I kind of pack it in.”At the moment, he’s working on a 1950s toy shop, a pop festival and a summer camp for an American company. It’s varied, but it’s always escapist. “A lot of people say when I do an image: ‘I’d like to live there,’” he says. “That’s the aim – to get that feeling for people. Hoping everything’s fine and lovely. I mean, we all like that, don’t we?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10db8016ade091ec8274a74f945685d588e13595/0_216_6134_3681/master/6134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcb6ac929a9983d5b539fe2ad72e43c5","title":"ive been going bananas without it tennis obsessives pick up their rackets again","story":"Courts across the country are re-opening, and for many it’s not a moment too soon There are some sounds you don’t know you’re nostalgic for until you hear them. The thwack of a well hit tennis ball has been missing from this British spring. It is surprisingly cheering, on a bright Saturday morning, to hear it return. By nine o’clock yesterday, the first weekend of play since lockdown began two months ago, the 14 courts at Coolhurst Tennis Club in Crouch End in north London were full.Among the early starters was David Berry, whose book A People’s History of Tennis is published this week. Berry talks of the relief of getting back, though a few things have changed. “What our bodies aren’t used to is playing singles,” he says – doubles is still not possible with social distancing. “My best friend Adam and I have played a mixed doubles every week for about the last 25 years. I had a Zoom conversation with two of the women we play with and they were going up the wall not being on court. It really affects people. It is the combination of that physical game you enjoy and then getting together for a drink and a gossip.”Berry came back to tennis in his 40s after throwing his rackets away at 17 having lost at the Berkshire junior championships to someone he should have beaten. He has mellowed somewhat on court. His book makes a persuasive case for tennis as a great democratic game, unearthing among other things the story of the “workers’ Wimbledon” organised by the Labour party and the TUC in the 1930s and 1940s.“The elite image that tennis gets has never been my experience,” he says. “Clubs want as many players as they can get.” There are nearly three million regular players in Britain. Not since Wimbledon was bombed in 1940 has there been such a hiatus in the game.As far as they could on Saturday players were warily following the guidelines. There were efforts to play with two sets of balls, marked for each player. A few wore a surgical glove on their non-racket hand. In some ways, of course, tennis is made for social distancing as Wimbledon’s favourite existentialist Andre Agassi observed: “In tennis you stand face to face with the enemy but you never touch him or talk to him. Of all the games men and women play, tennis is the closest to solitary confinement.”That is not quite how it seemed yesterday – though the clubhouse was closed and players did not linger after their matches. Russel Levi, a legal analyst and captain of the Coolhurst sixth team, has been working from home. While acknowledging that a return to playing sport feels like a huge privilege, he fears his game has suffered a bit.“I played on Thursday and I was very rusty but it felt like a bit of WD40 had been applied by yesterday,” he says. His son bought him a “Chinese tennis trainer” – “basically a ball on a piece of elastic” – for his birthday in March and, though he could take out a bit of frustration on it, it wasn’t quite the same thing.Among the obsessives is Nick Bateson, 66, who is ranked “about 10” in the country for his age and generally plays at least two hours every day.“The first month out wasn’t too bad,” he says. “I was doing yoga and stuff, but the last few weeks I’ve been going bananas. I was agitated and depressed. I think my wife was hiding bottles in case I turned to drink.”Bateson’s tennis coach went down quite badly with the virus for a month, he says, but he hasn’t been too worried about catching it himself, saying: “At my age there is obviously more risk, but I’m pretty fit.”He is worried more about his mental health. A few weeks ago he noticed a hole in the fencing around the courts in his local park. He says: “I snuck though and was in there practising my serve. But somebody must have grassed on me and the council came and patched the hole.“The thing is, you miss those chemicals in your blood when you hit that perfect backhand. I hit one this morning. It was like heaven on earth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3063777210d8c4a14de57fb69a03dfec6fc2026/3_0_5899_3543/master/5899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=066ef2ea7659238c2e0a229e01771ce0","title":"blind date takeover looking for love in lockdown podcast part 2","story":"In the concluding part of our Blind Date takeover, two more couples meet remotely for a socially distanced evening of drinks and dinnerIn part 1 of our Blind Date takeover last week, three couples met up via Zoom and let us listen in to what a first date sounds like in the age of lockdowns.

That is why I have decided not to contest the forthcoming elections within Momentum and instead will hand over to a new leadership.”He continued: “We desperately need better governance in our party, as the leaked report has further demonstrated. Members need justice for sabotage, misuse of funds, plus racist, sexist, ableist and frankly McCarthyite attitudes.“But we must also make sure that the party’s machinery never again returns to those days of anti-democratic stitch-ups, factional warfare, and toxic culture.”The longtime campaigner, who studied economics at Cambridge in the 1970s, notably worked on Corbyn’s campaign for the party leadership in 2015 which culminated in the unlikely return of a socialist to the role.He wrote that upon Corbyn becoming leader, socialists were few in the Labour party, but “today we are many” and there was “real cause amongst us for hope and confidence”.Lansman added: “In 2017, with an incredibly popular socialist manifesto, we achieved the biggest swing to Labour since 1945. Promising to restore public ownership and end austerity, we came within just 2,500 votes across a handful of constituencies from forming a government.”He credited the movement around Corbyn, bolstered by Momentum’s grassroots campaigning and viral videos, for forcing Labour to “never again be the party of illegal invasions, anti-immigration mugs or support for Tory policies of austerity and privatisation”.However, he lamented that the NEC was unfit for purpose and said it needed to be given greater powers to provide adequate scrutiny and oversight over the party and its leadership. It comes after he was campaign chief of Rebecca Long-Bailey’s unsuccessful run for leadership, in which she lost out to Keir Starmer.Long-Bailey tweeted Lansman her best wishes, describing him as a “tireless voice for Labour party democracy”.Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, also tweeted to wish Lansman all the best, calling him “a true socialist” who “has fought injustice and inequality and will continue to do so”.Of the attempts – sometimes controversial – to reselect parliamentary candidates in certain constituencies by leftwing activists, Lansman wrote: “We didn’t succeed in democratising the party sufficiently while Jeremy was leader, but we must not give up now. It’s now more important than ever that Labour becomes a grassroots member-led movement.”Acknowledging he had made mistakes and had some regrets – without revealing what they were – Lansman said the struggle for an equal and environmentally sustainable world would continue, though there has been speculation about whether Momentum can survive Corbyn’s departure.“I shall stay around to support my successors in Momentum,” he said. “I shall continue to speak out, even when some would rather I didn’t.”He added that he would return to blogging and focus his attentions on Labour’s national executive committee.A spokesperson for Momentum thanked Lansman for his years of dedication to the Labour party, saying: “He has done an incredible amount to transform the politics of this country. He has played a key role in building Labour into a half-a-million-member party and strengthening the movement for socialism in Britain.“We look forward to working with him as he continues to lead from the left on the NEC and across the movement.” The Forward Momentum campaign, which set out last month to “refound” and “democratise” Momentum, said it was pleased Lansman had recognised it was time for a new generation to take the organisation forward.“We need to put an end to stitch-ups, and candidates or slates being chosen behind closed doors in London,” it said in a statement. “We need Momentum to be a truly member-led organisation that campaigns to transform the Labour party and supports trade unions and social movements in their struggles for social and economic justice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/736861a006daf940a96b83c92c9b74ccfeb27062/38_59_3401_2041/master/3401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1413f6de8191f38357057548ab66364e","title":"thatcherite thinktanks back increase public spending in lockdown","story":"Free-market bodies support the government’s ramping up of debts to confront the Covid-19 outbreak  • Coronavirus – latest updates• See all our coronavirus coverageBritain’s leading free-market thinktanks, which backed Margaret Thatcher’s tax-cutting and privatisation agenda and sanctioned the last 10 years of austerity, have lent their support to the government’s plans for unprecedented and sustained increases in public spending.In a shift of stance that will give Rishi Sunak political clearance to ramp up UK debts to levels not seen in peacetime, the Adam Smith Institute, the Centre for Policy Studies, the Institute of Economic Affairs and Policy Exchange said they endorsed public spending increases to confront the coronavirus outbreak and state-funded investment to boost the recovery.The support for widespread state intervention to rescue the economy came as Boris Johnson told backbench Tory MPs there were no plans to impose a public sector wage freeze or other austerity measures to bring down public spending in the crisis.In a call to around 125 members of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, the Daily  reported that the prime minister said there was “no question” of a return to austerity, and assured them he would “double down” on funding transport projects in the north of England.Johnson addressed MPs after a leaked Treasury memo revealed that some officials were putting in place detailed plans for spending cuts to arrest a public sector deficit expected to climb by at least £300bn this year.Left-leaning thinktanks and academics have lined up to condemn plans for a return to austerity, saying it would harm the recovery, and adding that further government borrowing would be needed to secure a return to growth after the virus-induced mothballing of the economy.During the last recession, most free market thinktanks buttressed austerity measures imposed by the then chancellor George Osborne, arguing that the public sector deficit should be quickly reduced.Warwick Lightfoot, chief economist at Policy Exchange, said: “I don’t think anyone is arguing for a relaunch of austerity. Even an austerity hawk believes it is different this time.“The last thing you want to do is amplify the prospects of a full-blown depression,” he added.Policy Exchange, founded in 2002 by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office chief, Tory peer Francis Maude, former MP Nick Boles and businessman Archie Norman, has a loyal following in the cabinet and has claimed to be behind several recent Tory policies.Lightfoot said low interest rates meant the government could borrow cheaply to invest in infrastructure to get the economy back on its feet.Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, founded in the 1970s to promote free-market policies, said: “Even fiscally hawkish people have less of a problem with the current increase in debt levels.”Tom Clougherty, head of tax at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: “I’d usually be wary of big public investment schemes In the current circumstances, though, with borrowing costs very low and little prospect of crowding out private investment, I think the pros outweigh the cons.”The CPS was founded in the 1970s to combat socialism by former MP Keith Joseph, a close friend and supporter of Margaret Thatcher.Echoing left-leaning economists, Lesh said the Bank of England should support the government with loose monetary policy, allowing it to borrow at low interest rates.Julian Jessop, an economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs – a thinktank founded in the 1950s with the support of free-market economist Friedrich Hayek – said that he was relaxed about the debts built up during the worst of the lockdown. “There are obvious risks that austerity will restrict growth,” he said.But he was concerned that the government would harm the economy by keeping restrictions on business activity for much of the year, which would delay a bounce-back in economic growth.“The longer the economy is kept shuttered, the greater the risk that more of the damage will be permanent, making it that much harder to pay for better public services and infrastructure in the future,” he said.The four thinktanks continue to believe the Treasury should examine tax-cutting measures to promote innovation and entrepreneurial activity, saying that over the longer term, Whitehall was poor at allocating funds to the economy in the most effective way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fbf1703137ef8fe56d521760d88443a126ccbba/0_0_2560_1535/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84839fab28a65398e734bdc4ee3e0aaa","title":"whod be a health secretary five former incumbents on the toughest gig in politics","story":"With Matt Hancock under fire, former health secretaries discuss their highs and lows, how they dealt with pandemics – and what the future holdsOne effect of the unprecedented socioeconomic impact of Covid-19 has been to catapult the secretary of state for health and social care to the forefront of British politics. For the long month of April, with the prime minister either in intensive care with the disease or recuperating in isolation, there was no one with a more prominent government profile than Matt Hancock.It was, to say the least, an unusual predicament for a health secretary. Since the controversy around the target of 100,000 daily coronavirus tests and Boris Johnson’s return to work, Hancock has taken a small step back from the limelight. But if, in the final analysis, he is adjudged to have had a good pandemic, he could well be seen as a leader in waiting.On the other hand, if the UK’s death count ends up the highest in Europe, as it currently stands, and the reports continue to mount of shortages in protective clothing and problems with testing and tracing, then history’s equivalent of a surgical waste bin may well await him.Glory or infamy – those are the grand stakes in this unparalleled peacetime civil operation. Yet any halfway ambitious politician would relish the chance to be in Hancock’s shoes right now. And it’s rare that that can be said about the occupant of his office.Come the casino hour of our parliamentary system – the cabinet reshuffle – very few politicians entering No 10 hope to be named health secretary. It’s a post with no visible upside. When anything goes wrong in health, someone usually dies. And things always go wrong. On top of which, the terrain is knee-deep in well-organised interest groups, all demanding more of everything.A widespread wariness about the job was most memorably captured in the response of the pugnacious Labour politician John Reid when appointed in 2003 by Tony Blair. “Oh fuck,” he’s supposed to have said, “not health.”Kenneth Clarke, who was health secretary in the last couple of years of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, says that over the years he has issued a warning to various successors, both Labour and Conservative: “You’re going to a political graveyard. If you can survive it, then you’re ready, really ready, for the heat of frontline politics.”Clarke describes the role as one of constant bombardment, unrelenting demands to do what others say, ceaseless criticism in the press, from opposition and interest groups, repeated declarations of a crisis and almost universal unpopularity, including among your cabinet colleagues. It sounds, I say, like the job from hell.“I thought it was just immense fun,” says Clarke.As a belligerent spirit was the signature style of the first modern health secretary, Aneurin Bevan, perhaps it should be no surprise that, like ministerial red boxes, it has become part of the job description. The machismo might explain why the health ministry has been largely a male preserve. There have only been three female health secretaries, beginning in 1974 with Barbara Castle, who, it must be said, was no shrinking violet. (Virginia Bottomley and Patricia Hewitt were approached for this piece, but both declined to speak.)Although there has been some kind of minister for health dating back to the mid-19th century, it was not until a hundred years later, and the arrival in 1945 of Bevan, that the role we recognise today first took shape. A former miner who left school at 13, Bevan was a renowned political bruiser who drove through the National Health Service Act with unyielding determination.He had to overcome opposition from his own Labour benches as well as from within the Conservative party and the British Medical Association (BMA), whose members disparaged him as the “Tito of Tonypandy”. But facing down his opponents, Bevan created a free-at-the-point-of-delivery health service for all, one that opened its doors on 5 July 1948. By the time he died 12 years after the NHS’s birth, Bevan had become a national hero.That can’t be said of any of his often unloved successors, although each of them has played a part in developing an NHS that has grown far beyond what Bevan envisaged.“The budget was £200m the year Nye Bevan introduced the NHS,” says Alan Johnson, health secretary under Gordon Brown. “It was £110 bn when I left the job.”It is currently £140bn. Even accounting for inflation, that’s an extraordinary increase yet whatever the figure, it’s never enough. The NHS is the fifth-largest employer in the world. It’s a gargantuan operation that necessarily contains large inefficiencies and daunting shortages. But we pay less per head of population for our health system than any other major western nation.That’s one reason the NHS is perennially viewed as underfunded – even though health is about the only government department whose budget has never been cut. Nearly all governments are accused of shortchanging the NHS, but in particular Conservatives, who have traditionally been seen as, at best, reluctant supporters of the NHS, and more often as would-be privatisers.All the Conservative former health secretaries I spoke to think this accusation is unfair and inaccurate, and bemoan the fact that they had to spend rather too much time in office contesting a falsehood. Nonetheless, Margaret Thatcher was once keen to see the UK adopt a US-style private insurance-funded health service. And from time to time, a Conservative thinktank or backbench ideologue will revisit the proposal, to keep the dream alive.Fowler, who served as health secretary for six years under Thatcher, accepts these points. “But,” he protests, “the significant thing is that those ideas have never got anywhere. And if they didn’t get anywhere under Margaret Thatcher, they’re not likely to get anywhere under any other prime minister.”Matt Hancock’s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, complains that whatever he did in the job, he always faced the same charge of having a secret agenda.“I was accused of starving the NHS of funds as a way of persuading the public that the only option was privatisation,” he says. “I then secured a £20bn rise in budget and the very same people said on Twitter: ‘Ah, he’s fattening the NHS up for privatisation.’”In fact, Conservative spending on health was limited for most of Hunt’s time in office and during that of his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, at least by comparison with the boom times of the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. In large part this was due to the austerity measures that the Coalition and Conservative governments imposed, following the 2008 financial crisis.Some critics have suggested that the shortfall in protective clothing for NHS staff witnessed in this pandemic is in part a legacy of underfunding during Hunt’s tenure. “I felt throughout my time as health secretary that it did need more resources,” Hunt concedes. “There is more you can do on efficiency, but in the end only so much, and it needed more resources.”In 2016, while Hunt was still in office, Exercise Cygnus was conducted to test how the UK would respond to a pandemic. According to leaked sections of the report, which has never been published, it was found that the country was not ready to cope, particularly in the area of social care.Hunt still maintains that austerity was the right policy to put the economy back on its feet, but he adds: “I don’t want to minimise the fact that this was a very tough period for the NHS.”One fan of Hunt’s work on the health select committee is Alan Johnson. “I think he’s doing a great job as chair,” he says, which is probably not the verdict he would give on Hunt’s time in office. Like Hunt, Johnson emphasises the drive to improve patient care as his biggest motivating factor when he was health secretary. He therefore had little time for those who perceived any outsourcing of services as backdoor privatisation. “You talk to people on the left and the job of the NHS is to employ public service workers,” he says, shaking his head in our FaceTime call. “Not to improve disgraceful waiting times.”For all his modernising zeal, Johnson says the NHS’s greatest strength is its old-fashioned social solidarity, a quality, be argues, that Conservatives don’t really understand. “It’s against all the philosophy they’ve imbibed.” The irony, then, is that social solidarity has never been more loudly promoted among Tories than by this current government. The NHS has been rebranded “Our NHS”, its workers hailed as national heroes, invoked at every turn by politicians and applauded every Thursday evening by the public. Although the form of expression is new, the sentiment is not. The NHS invariably features at the top of the list of institutions of which Britons feel most proud. The problem for health secretaries is that this national pride can manifest as an over-protectiveness – “Hands off the NHS” – that leaves them limited room for manoeuvre.As such, they often find themselves caught between contradictory instructions: improve the service and leave it alone. Fowler knows the syndrome well. “Put it this way,” he says, “one of the most serious bursts of applause I’ve ever had was when I was introduced at a conference of medical experts as the only secretary of state who didn’t try to reorganise the health service.”Clarke is less familiar with that kind of resounding applause. He embarked on a major overhaul of management, creating an internal market inspired in part, he says, by a need to head off Thatcher’s more radical proposals. It led to a series of massive rows between the prime minister and her health secretary. “Someone once told me we had 14 meetings about it,” he says, both amazed and amused by the number. “She was even more combative than I am. It was basically a bureaucratic shambles,” he says of the service he set about reforming, “as there was no proper management or control of the system.”In spite of his own restructuring of the NHS, which he says has stood the test of time because no one has reversed it, Clarke doesn’t think constant organisational reform is a good thing. “That must sound off coming from me. But you can’t have every secretary of state going in for an upheaval like that.”In a highly competitive field, perhaps the greatest upheaval was wrought by Andrew Lansley, David Cameron’s first health secretary. He is the exemplar of a longstanding NHS paradox – decentralisation from above. The more he argued for local empowerment, the more he micromanaged the transition, bolstering GPs, creating Public Health England, abolishing primary care trusts and much else besides. The consensus among his fellow health secretaries is that the reforms were misjudged, confusing and unnecessary.If reorganisational exhaustion in the wake of Lansley dampened the appetite for re-envisioning the NHS, Covid-19 has removed it from the agenda for the foreseeable future. For all its terrible toll of death and devastation, a major pandemic is a clarifying experience. Suddenly, discussions about rationalising regional management structures are beside the point. There is instead a unity of purpose and a galvanising sense of clear battle lines. It’s no coincidence that the most common political metaphors employed in the Covid-19 debate are military ones. Just as every defence secretary works to avoid war, but only really comes into his or her own when war breaks out, no health secretary wants a pandemic, and yet it’s their career-defining moment.If Fowler is remembered by some clinicians for his executive light touch, he is better known for his performance during the Aids crisis in the mid-1980s. It’s easy to forget, amid the relentless news coverage of Covid-19, but HIV was a killer virus for which there was no treatment when it first came to light. It has since killed tens of millions around the world, though in the UK today, HIV is seldom fatal. Initially, it sparked enormous fear and stigmatisation, particularly of the gay community, which suffered a disproportionate number of deaths. But it was a period that Fowler looks back on with most professional and political satisfaction. “The whole health service worked together no question, no arguments,” he says. “And when it acts together it really is a wonderful service.”There is also another feature of pandemics that can bring the best out in politicians. As few, if any, health secretaries come from medical backgrounds, they usually find themselves deferring to clinical expertise. This is especially true in a pandemic. The difference is that the art of communication – the politician’s area of expertise – also becomes increasingly important. In Fowler’s case, he had the job of informing the public and reforming its behaviour – primarily, encouraging the use of condoms. Hence the government’s bold advertising campaign “Don’t Die of Ignorance”, which grabbed the nation’s anxious attention in 1987.He also had to do battle with Thatcher, and some of his cabinet colleagues, who were either squeamish or positively damning about issues of gay sexual practice and intravenous drug use – the main conduits of HIV transmission in this country.“I got totally frustrated in 1986,” he recalls. “It was a national crisis and I didn’t think we were making the progress we should be making in a national crisis. I remember being asked: ‘Do we have to have this section on risky sex?’ The whole point of the advertisement was to explain to people why they should avoid what they called risky sex!”Given the prime ministerial scrutiny he was under, I ask him whether it’s at all liberating for a health secretary if your boss is, as Johnson recently was, out of commission. “I never had that luxury,” he laments. “Theoretically, it’s not an ideal circumstance.”Fowler is not the only health secretary in living memory who faced a pandemic in office.“I was three days into the job when a global pandemic was declared with swine flu,” says Burnham, adding as a humorous aside: “As he exited the door, Mr Alan Johnson proved again that he’s a master of political timing.” Interestingly, Johnson recalls the pandemic as something that happened on his shift. “What took up most of my time?” he asks. “Well, there was the pandemic, of course.”In the event, regardless of who was in the hot seat, the H1N1 swine flu was not nearly as life-threatening as first feared. Some critics consequently suggested that the Labour government and the two health secretaries overreacted. But both men highlight the fact that a pandemic was top of the government risk register and they were well prepared to deal with it. Just as a flawed or under-resourced plan can leave a health secretary on the defensive, the more successful a strategy is, the less people get to see how bad things might have been. In a political sense it’s a lose-lose situation. “It was kind of a fraught terrain in those early days of swine flu,” remembers Burnham. “I made mistakes wrestling with these issues and sometimes came down on the wrong side.” He regrets putting the worst-case scenario statistics in the public domain – 60,000 deaths were predicted at the upper end, but there were actually fewer than 500. He also recalls a “car crash” TV interview with Andrew Castle, whose daughter had had a seriously adverse reaction to Tamiflu, the prophylactic issued to children. “I came away thinking, I’m not the person to be defending Tamiflu on national television,” he says.His advice for Hancock is to resist the temptation to front the message too much on TV. Hunt, however, has only praise for what he says has been a strong communications campaign with a clear message – we spoke before the much-criticised change from “stay home” to “stay alert”. That said, he believes a longer-term strategy should be clearly outlined. “People need to understand how we’re going to exit the current situation.”Clarke picks out Hancock as a good performer among some less impressive government ministers, but he offers a word of caution directly to the young health secretary. “My advice to you will be, don’t start giving forecasts when we’re dealing with a total unknown here, and don’t start making forecasts on testing.”Several of the former health secretaries thought that Hancock made himself a hostage to fortune with his promise of reaching 100,000 coronavirus tests by the end of April. But all agree that it won’t be until an inquiry is held after the crisis has passed that any worthwhile or lasting judgments can be made on the government’s and Hancock’s handling of the pandemic. In the meantime, Burnham thinks the best thing to come out of the crisis is that the NHS will no longer be under any kind of existential threat, real or imagined. “Nobody will privatise it now nobody will introduce different funding models. It’s finally entered into that sort of sacred space.” He argues that social care provision should be folded into the NHS. While he’s long supported this option, he says the case is irrefutable now the limitations of the social care system have been thoroughly exposed by Covid-19. “How can someone who is so essential that they are caring for another human being not be paid the living wage?” he asks. “It’s shameful.”There seems little doubt that social care is the neglected side of the portfolio in the Department of Health and Social Care, the unloved child forever in the shadow of its revered sibling. It would amount to a massive undertaking and significant investment to bring social care under the NHS umbrella. Whether or not it’s something Hancock will consider, it’s hard to believe that what Johnson calls the “scandalous crisis in adult social care” can be allowed to continue after the viral dust has settled.There have been no shortage of predictions – some wildly optimistic, others darkly ominous – about the post-Covid-19 world. The first task, obviously, is to make it a post-Covid-19 world, and in that endeavour the health secretary has a vital role to play. It’s far too early to know what the outcome will look like, or when it will arrive, but perhaps we can tentatively suggest that in the next cabinet reshuffle the word on the health job won’t be a four-letter one.Key issue  How to mount an Aids public awareness campaign.Most satisfying aspect of the job? “It goes back to Aids again.

They were people actually who kept me going for nearly six years.”Biggest surprise? “I found out that 150 people a week die in the NHS because of errors in their medical treatment. I was gobsmacked by that. Then I discovered this was actually true all over the world this is what happens in medicine.”Have you ever been interested in privatising the NHS? “I’ve always been a passionate believer in the NHS. There’s something about what the NHS stands for which speaks to the best of British values.”Do you think this pandemic calls for the help of former health secretaries? “I think there’s a role for people outside politics to come in in moments of national crisis. There are times when you need people who can – to use that horrible business phrase – JFDI things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3325a71cd8441be29381b75fd10d80352bc0522c/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5339e07a57004bdd4a004ffc48b57a56","title":"government to invest 93m in uk vaccine manufacturing centre","story":"Facility to open next summer, with earlier deployment possible to make coronavirus vaccineThe British government will invest up to £93m to bring forward construction of a new vaccine manufacturing centre, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said on Saturday.The funding will ensure the new centre opens in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule. The Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) is a key component of the government’s programme to ensure that once a coronavirus vaccine is available, it can be rolled out quickly in mass quantities, the department said.The not-for-profit facility on the Harwell science and innovation campus in Oxfordshire will have the capacity to produce enough doses for the entire UK population in as little as six months.A further £38m is being invested in a rapid deployment facility which will be able to begin manufacturing at scale from this summer if a vaccine becomes available before the new centre is complete.Officials said the VMIC would also boost the UK’s long-term capacity for dealing with future viruses and accelerate the production of vaccines for existing illnesses such as the flu virus.Announcing the investment, Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said: “Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions.”Sir Mark Walport, the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) chief executive, called the centre “an essential new weapon in the UK’s arsenal against diseases and other biological threats”.He said: “The UKRI-funded teams at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London have developed potential coronavirus vaccines at unprecedented speed.“By working with partners including government, VMIC and the Vaccines Taskforce to fast-track the manufacturing capability, we are ensuring that momentum will continue all the way from lab to patient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fafb7711bf8c292a4d28cdb506403e8e8f6915a/0_206_5760_3454/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd24f4df7baeb2dc490caf88fcfe5012","title":"sara maitland savour solitude it is not the same as loneliness","story":"The author argues we should celebrate the positives of being alone - and that concerns about the effects of lockdown on mental health may be misplacedFrankly, I am having rather a good lockdown. Partly this is because I live very rurally – Dumfries and Galloway, in south-west Scotland, has an exceptionally low population density (about 60 people per square mile compared to the UK average of 727). Social distancing is a great deal easier and less stressful where there are so many fewer people. In addition, almost everyone who lives up my single track road works in agriculture and is therefore an essential worker and not in lockdown. Life is pretty “normal” in a daily sense. And we have a strong sense of community cohesion and care. Within 24 hours of the lockdown our “resilience hub” had been established because I am over 70 my shopping is done for me and delivered, my neighbours keep an eye out for me. I feel both safe and undisturbed.Moreover, after about the dreariest, wettest three months I can remember, we have been enjoying an extraordinary and glorious spring. The absence of traffic, both on the roads and in the sky, mean not just a wonderful quiet peacefulness but also a massive improvement in air quality. This combination of sunshine, hush and low pollution has increased birdsong – the other day I actually found myself irritated by the incessant repetitious carry-on of a cuckoo – and very possibly both wild flowers and butterflies. In addition we have had a good lambing and there can be few hearts not cheered by the enchanting gambolling of new black-faced hill lambs.However, the most important reason I am enjoying lockdown, I believe, is that I am used to being alone. I am practised in silence and solitude. I have lived on my own for nearly 30 years – 12 of them in this upland glen where I built my own single-person home on the ruins of an ancient steading. And I can say with authority that it is simply not the case that solitude is inevitably bad for your mental health.Every time I go online I encounter yet more panic about how lockdown is going to drive us all mad. Depression apparently lurks in solitude and we need to take unbelievable care of ourselves if we hope to emerge from all this with any sanity or wellbeing intact. But solitude and loneliness are two very different things: the first example of the use of the word solitude given on my pre-pandemic online dictionary is “she savoured her hours of freedom and solitude”. That does not sound too bad.Meanwhile we give them no training or support in the apparently difficult and “unnatural” skill of being alone.How much better it would be for the struggling parent to make it a reward for virtue – “You have been so helpful good politewhatever all afternoon, now you can go to your room and be alone for a bit as a treat” – and never a punishment. The “epidemic of loneliness” we hear so much about in the early 21st century might well become a “joy of solitude” if it was experienced as a positive and earned pleasure from early childhood.There is a good if odd little example of how our terror of children being alone is warping our sensitivity to their needs in Richard Louv’s wonderful 2005 book  Last Child in the Woods. He argues persuasively that “nature deprivation” is seriously damaging to young people and almost boasts that he lets his children go into the woods without adults – and then adds “so long as they have their mobile phones with them”. If we took this seriously it would suggest that almost everyone over about 50 had been placed at serious risk by their parents.My children’s father did a sweet thing when they were very little. As we went to bed he used to place an unexpected toy in the cot with them so that when they woke up they would have a treat and something to do with and by themselves. Part of the hope of course was that we might get an extra minute or two of sleep, but it was also so that they could learn that being alone could be fun and exciting.The thing is that, quite apart from Covid-19, young people are increasingly going to need the skills of being alone happily between 1999 and 2019 the number of adults living in single-person households rose by nearly a quarter, from 6.8 million to 8.2 million and is projected to go on rising. It would be tragic if all these iniduals were doomed to poor mental health and loneliness.What if, instead of a huge disadvantage, being alone were framed as an opportunity for developing the self? Solitude seems to be more or less a necessity for creativity, for instance, whether it is drawing, painting, writing, learning an instrument, cooking or any other kind of creative activity. It is also very useful for anyone wanting to deepen their spirituality – this is why both Christians and Buddhists encourage retreats: periods of chosen isolation and usually silence.I believe that in order to see well, and particularly to see wild nature, you need to be comfortable within your own solitude. Almost all good field naturalists would agree that both the silence and the patience needed are enhanced when you walk or sit by yourself there is a particular quality of attentiveness (which may in fact be similar to that needed for creativity) which the presence of someone else can too easily dissipate.We know too that practised solitude increases self-knowledge and independence. And this makes us less vulnerable to emotional abuse and more able to remove ourselves from such situations. And this in itself may well make us a better, because less needy, friend when we do engage.Spending time alone is in fact spending time with the person you know best of all and who knows you better than anyone else does. Solitude deepens self-knowledge. Interestingly, the words “solitude” and “loneliness” ought to have similar meanings: “solo” and “alone” do after all. But faced with courage and determination they do not.Loneliness is a negative, sad feeling. Solitude on the other hand is bliss. And practice makes perfect. So practise.Sara Maitland is the author of A Book of Silence (Granta, £9.99) and How To Be Alone (Macmillan £8.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43c20e6cd0d50a8d12171ea844df94bc0e768711/0_0_4551_2731/master/4551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c115e57770af14a6dc62dd521e456e68","title":"colditz to silverstone incredible tale of tony rolt f1 motor sport","story":"F1’s first race took place 70 years ago this week and featured a war hero who went on to win Le Mans before becoming a successful engineer and businessmanSeventy years ago this week, Formula One thundered into action for the very first time. The sport is celebrating its anniversary, its longevity and the pantheon of drivers who have become household names, but when F1 began that weekend at Silverstone, it was also host to a little-known hero.Tony Rolt’s name is written into F1’s opening chapter but his story demands a broader canvas. He was a youthful prodigy, a soldier decorated for gallantry, a serial escapee in the second world war and designer and builder of the Colditz glider, a Le Mans winner and a successful engineer and businessman.That inaugural grand prix did not go well for Rolt. Peter Walker had done well to qualify his English Racing Automobiles (ERA) car in 10th but when Rolt took the wheel for the race he was forced to retire after only four laps with a gearbox failure. But for Rolt, who had come through the crucible of conflict, just going racing was enough. He had known crushing disappointment in capture and imprisonment during the war and could take the slings and arrows of competition with aplomb.Born in 1918 and enamoured of racing as a child, he was fortunate to have a mother willing to indulge his passion. Perhaps hoping to curb the excesses that had already resulted in him being caught by the police for driving under age, she bought him a Morgan three-wheeler when he was 16, in which he competed in schoolboy trails events for Eton.He persuaded his mother to buy the famous ERA car known as Remus from Thailand’s Prince Bira, who would go on to be another competitor in that first grand prix at Silverstone. Shortly afterwards, while racing Remus at Brooklands, Rolt demonstrated his assuredness and bravery. A loose bolt allowed exhaust gas and flames into his cockpit and Rolt calmly removed a glove, shoved it into the offending hole and went on to win. In 1939 aged only 20 he did so again with such skill he had become impossible to ignore. He won the British Empire Trophy at Donington. “Boy driver wins 200-mile race. Experts all upset at Donington Park,” read the headlines in the Sunday Mercury afterwards.A grand career in racing beckoned until the war intervened, as his son Stuart, now 71, recalls. “He was going places rapidly as a private entrant and then the war came along,” he says. “He would drive anything he could get his hands on but left motor racing because of Adolf Hitler at a point when he was being lined up to drive all sorts of stuff. There were people interested who really rated him and he was young. He was ready to become a top driver of the time.”Fate had other plans and Rolt would distinguish himself with the same quiet determination in service of his country as he had behind the wheel. As an officer in the Rifle Brigade he was ordered to Calais to prop up the crumbling French defence, as the evacuation at Dunkirk proceeded.After only five days of fighting his battalion was captured but not before Rolt had proved himself, assisting a wounded comrade while still firing his Bren gun at the enemy. He was awarded the Military Cross but was set to spend the rest of the war in captivity, anathema to the young charger. “He was hugely frustrated,” says Stuart. “He wasn’t doing his bit for his country and there was anger that his war was over after five days and an absolute determination to get home and fight.”Rolt proved his resolve in no uncertain fashion. Seven escape attempts followed. He suffered the cruel disappointment of making it to within 100m of the Swiss border on one occasion. The Germans failed to confiscate the false documents he had been using and Stuart still has them. On another he and his comrades walked out of a camp dressed as Swiss Red Cross visitors. “It worked brilliantly,” Rolt later recalled. “We watched them arrive, waited a suitable length of time and then walked out the main gate. We then walked for two nights using makeshift maps.” The escapers managed to board a train but were ultimately recaptured.Like other serial escapers Rolt was sent to Colditz Castle in February 1944. Fearing the SS might execute the prisoners Rolt came up with an audacious plan to secure a way out for at least two of them: building a glider and launching it from the gloomy stalag. Its construction was well under way, hidden in the eaves of the building, when the officers were told to cease escape attempts because of the approaching end of the war.Rolt returned home but had lost six years of his career. He threw himself back into the sport but it was a different experience to that of the late 1930s. Now driving an Alfa Romeo he raced whenever and wherever he had the chance. “He got stuck in,” says Stuart. “But in an ideal world he would have been a grand prix driver.”He at least made it to the grid for that momentous occasion at Silverstone in 1950. It ended sadly as did his other two grands prix, both at Silverstone where he again suffered mechanical failures in 1953 and 1955. Undeterred, Rolt took drives wherever he could, proving himself a master in sports cars.In 1952 as reserve driver in the RAC Tourist Trophy at Dundrod he lapped quicker than Stirling Moss in the Jaguar C-type. Jaguar promptly offered him a works drive. The next year, alongside his teammate and friend Duncan Hamilton, they won the Le Mans 24 hours. The following year they were second. In 1955 they retired while in second in a race marked by terrible tragedy. It was the year more than 80 people were killed when a Mercedes flew into spectators on the pit straight. The incident was shocking and Rolt, with a young family and a fledgling engineering business, called time on racing at the end of 1955.His association with the sport continued, however. Rolt’s engineering firm focused on building new technology around four-wheel drive and anti-lock braking. Working with the inventor of the modern tractor, Harry Ferguson’s, company, he designed and built the Ferguson P99. It remains the only four-wheel drive car to win an F1 race, the non-championship Oulton Park Gold Cup in 1961, driven – appropriately – by Moss. His transmission systems were used in Ford’s world championship-winning rally cars and with pleasing symmetry in the Audis that were all-conquering at Le Mans in the 2000s.Silverstone too remained close to his heart. He was a proud member of the British Racing Drivers’ Club and Stuart has fond memories of his father and friends in charge of the inside of the corner at Becketts for many, many grands prix. He attended F1 for the rest of his life until his death aged 89 in 2008.Rolt may have been a bit player when F1’s 70-year journey began but he has his place as much more than a footnote in the history books. “He had an overwhelming love of motor sport, he lived and breathed it and he had an extraordinary life,” says Stuart. “The war definitely had an effect on him but after that he was determined to prove himself to he world and he did it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de45111bffb74176078a0d1e512b76cfe90dcfa8/0_39_5001_3000/master/5001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed0ef2243e89fcaaed429bebcec3d4a7","title":"my favourite game rossi v lorenzo 2015 valencian motogp grand prix","story":"After an unbearably tense finale, the Italian was kicking himself after he threw away the title amid accusations of conspiracy“Márquez would prefer Lorenzo to win.” So said a frustrated Valentino Rossi, leading the 2015 MotoGP standings and gunning for world championship number 10, lighting a fuse that would eventually result in his title aspirations disintegrating before his eyes.The Italian was clearly feeling the pressure of heading the points table for the entirety of the year, and his accusation towards Marc Márquez, a rider who was out of the title picture, before the penultimate round of the season in Malaysia, led to one of the most acrimonious ever finishes to a season.He was referencing the previous race in Australia, where the Italian thought Márquez had “helped” his Spanish compatriot Jorge Lorenzo by putting up less of a fight against him than against Rossi. The pair had also shared two previous on-track battles that year in Argentina and the Netherlands, both of which the Italian came through to win.The frustration felt by “the Doctor” came to an explosive head in the race at Sepang, where he was adjudged to have kicked Márquez off his bike in a wheel-to-wheel battle for the final spot on the rostrum. Rossi was allowed to keep his points for the race but was demoted to last place on the grid for the season’s conclusion, in Valencia.In the weeks leading up to the race in Spain, cries of conspiracy and collusion filled the air. An Italian was being pushed to the back of the grid for the finale in Spain, which would benefit the Spanish rider Lorenzo? It was too much of a coincidence for some of the Italian’s more irate fans. Such was the animosity directed towards Márquez in particular that the Thursday press conference was cancelled.Rossi led Lorenzo by seven points going into the race. With the latter looking odds-on to take the win and the 25 points that came with it, Rossi had to climb from 25th on the grid to second, a gargantuan task on a track where is notoriously difficult to pass.As the lights went out Lorenzo, Márquez, and Dani Pedrosa got off the line smoothly. However, all eyes were directed firmly towards the back of the grid, where Rossi was making his charge. The Italian made a lightning start, slicing his way through to 16th place before the first corner, picking up seven places within seconds of the start. With the crowd at fever pitch, you would have thought the race was being staged in Italy, for everyone’s attention was on No 46 as he made up place after place, lap after lap.By lap seven, Rossi was up to seventh. His pace was electric, but he was losing vital seconds to the front three as they ran their own race at the front of the pack in clean air. The tension was almost unbearable, as Rossi finally made it up to fourth. He needed second place, or he needed Márquez and Pedrosa to overtake Lorenzo, with the latter looking good for the win.As the laps ticked away, so did Rossi’s pace and his hopes for world title number 10. His charge through the field left his tyres in poor condition, and with Lorenzo riding as smooth as ever at the front, only a fleeting attempt by the third-placed Pedrosa to go for the win stood between the Mallorcan and a fifth world title.Lorenzo crossed the finish line with Márquez right on his tail (0.263sec back to precise) and Rossi almost 20 seconds further behind. The Mallorcan had kept his head down and avoided all the controversy that had engulfed the finale of the championship. Where others had floundered, he had flourished.Despite the failure to seal a 10th title, Rossi was welcomed into the pits as if he had won the championship. He had passed up the potential to win another world title through one moment of madness a few weeks earlier, and there was nothing he could do about it"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a0e2c116d857025b1ced8ee34bdfd0f20130120/0_211_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cba2b6bdb5262e149b5b8cb21382a781","title":"the big picture a pause during celebrations in 90s bulgaria","story":"Births, marriages and fleeting hopes in times of struggle catch the eye of Witold KrassowskiWitold Krassowski took this photograph of a bride and her bridesmaid at a wedding celebration in Bulgaria in 1991. In his new book, Sackcloth and Ashes, there is a companion picture to this one, which shows the same wedding party parading along a street in Fakulteta, the Roma ghetto in the capital, Sofia. In that picture, the bride picks her way through mud and rubbish, leading a raggedy line of revellers that includes a clarinettist and an accordion player. Here the instruments have been hung up on the shack behind, in a pause in the festivities.Fakulteta is the kind of place Krassowski has been documenting for 30 years. Its 25,000 residents remain cut off from the Bulgarian capital, long denied water and sanitation, and with only off-grid electricity. Many residents are effectively forced to work recycling the industrial waste that is dumped in the area. Krassowski, who first took photographs of his native Poland at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, has subsequently travelled in places as distinct as Tanzania, Peru and Mongolia, but his photographs have a remarkable collective poignancy. He has often been drawn to the universal exclamation marks in human lives – births, marriages and deaths and, as here, to little moments of reflection and hope in lives characterised by hardship and struggle.Speaking of his book, 120 black-and-white silver halide film prints selected from half a lifetime’s work, Krassowski notes how many of his subjects may now be dead and the purpose of the commissions that drove his projects long forgotten. “In the book, however, I hope to keep alive a little longer what unites them: my personal approach, a sense of deep unity beyond cultures. It is important to me that the impact of political events can be understood from the point of view of ordinary people in their ordinary lives.”• Sackcloth and Ashes by Witold Krassowski (GOST Books, £40).

Born 12 March 1776, Queen Anne Street, Marylebone, London.Claim to fameThe big puzzle about Hester Stanhope is how we’ve reached 2020 without a massive Netflix drama ever having been made about her fascinating life. Born into the British elite – the niece of prime minister William Pitt and the granddaughter of a man who made his fortune after discovering an enormous diamond in India, she was all set up for a life of comfort. Instead, shaken by a failed love affair, she left England when she was in her 30s, never to return. She travelled to Europe, then the Middle East, lost all her clothes in a shipwreck and started dressing as a man. She visited harems, smoked pipes, impressed the Bedouin with her horsemanship and, having discovered a mysterious map that suggested treasure was buried under the ruins of a mosque, undertook pioneering archaeological work in Palestine. She also travelled to Turkey, Malta, Egypt and Syria, finally settling in a turbulent corner of Lebanon.Supporting documentationThree volumes of travels and three of memoirs published after her death record her extraordinary journeys and unconventional views. Hester was headstrong and brilliant, and terrified people with her sharp tongue. Lord Byron met her in Greece and complained she had “a great disregard of received notion in her conversation as well as conduct”. Which is pretty rich, coming from Byron. Despite being a woman and a Christian, Hester defied tradition by riding into Damascus unveiled. “The crowds who watched must have been shocked into inaction” is the verdict of one biographer.Distinguishing marksThough too tall to be conventionally beautiful in her era – she measured nearly six feet – Hester was a striking and charismatic presence. In old age, she preserved her mystique by receiving visitors in a darkened room and making them drink a weird black concoction before they saw her. She also shaved her head for convenience, and wore a turban.Last sightedHester spent the last seven years of her incredible life in her draughty fortress outside a Lebanese village, heavily in debt and going increasingly out of her mind. When asked if she wouldn’t prefer to return home and live out her days in relative comfort, she was contemptuous, insisting that she had no intention of going back to “knit or sew like an Englishwoman”. She died in her sleep in 1839, aged 63.Intrepidness ratingAn endlessly remarkable fusion of Lawrence of Arabia and Germaine Greer, Hester surely deserves 9.5."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf32fbf049f1c0bce5eeb14781e08c840cd45f6a/0_12_1361_817/master/1361.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f939ab3265f5de17991834a16d91ccaf","title":"inside talking pictures the ultimate in lockdown comfort tv","story":"A retro TV channel that resurrects forgotten movies and cult series is celebrating its fifth birthday with 3.5 million weekly viewers - and it’s all run from a family home in WatfordIt’s perfect lockdown viewing, a comforting loop of the past, broadcasting old films and vintage TV, 24 hours a day. You might call the Talking Pictures cable channel the anti-Netflix, with its roster of forgotten minor movies alongside cult series and documentaries, but the channel has seen viewing numbers boom during the pandemic, with audience figures of just over 3.5 million a week. “And from the post we get, and the phone calls,” says co-founder Sarah Cronin-Stanley, “we’re sure it’s much more.”There is nothing ostentatious or big-budget about Talking Pictures. It is run by a family in an ordinary house on an ordinary road in a village near Watford. Their headquarters is an extension in the garden, full of film canisters, DVDs and strings of thank-you cards from loyal fans. The team comprises Sarah Cronin-Stanley, a vintage TV and film fan and former actor her husband, Neill, who produces the weekly newsletter and looks after TV regulations compliance and Sarah’s dad Noel Cronin, a film distributor who began his career six decades ago in the Rank Organisation post-room. (Sarah and Neill’s 10-year-old son lives in the house too. He loves Laurel and Hardy.)With its fifth birthday coming up next month, Talking Pictures has been busy expanding its output, with cult classics including 60s drama Up the Junction, Nicholas Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth, starring David Bowie, and the Richard Burton thriller The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. Coming up this week are Julie Christie and Alan Bates in The Go-Between, and the much-adored late 1970s TV serial Quatermass, featuring John Mills. High-profile fans of the channel include Kenneth Branagh and Brian Blessed (“they watch a film at the same time together, then discuss it afterwards”, Cronin-Stanley says). Vic Reeves and Jools Holland are regular viewers too and so, apparently, is the Queen, who is said to tune in for Laurel and Hardy. “Vic Reeves said we were like the comforting taste of oxtail soup and being off school,” Cronin-Stanley says.I get in touch with the Talking Pictures team in the early days of lockdown. I fancy nosing around their offices, but, somewhat fittingly, they don’t do Zoom. Instead, I call their landline, which is accessible to the public on their website. “We get lots of calls from viewers, but it’s nice,” says Cronin-Stanley. “Often people are just lonely and want a chat.”Noel Cronin joined the Rank Organisation in 1962, at 14, delivering post at their film-processing laboratories in Park Royal, west London: “I remember the heady smell of the Guinness factory, the chimneys,” he says. “That was an era when people were shy. Leaving school and going into a huge office was daunting.” He progressed to cutting rooms in Mayfair, before moving to the Central Office of Information, where Chris Tarrant and Peter Greenaway were among his colleagues.Having progressed to occasional executive producing and film distribution in the 1990s, he noticed old films disappearing from TV schedules: “Black and white suddenly became a no-no on TV unless it was The Third Man, but I’d been in film long enough to know the tide turns.” He started buying up films, acquiring Scrooge and The Pickwick Papers and the Four-Star Playhouse catalogue, featuring David Niven.I mention missing the days when you could catch old classics like these popping up on mainstream TV. ““Don’t get me on my soapbox now!” he laughs. “The BBC and ITV went for cheap programming instead. All that awful ‘buy a house, bake a cake, weed your window box’ stuff. A film has always had more worth than that.”Today, the channel plays films it owns along with others under licence. Cronin plans the schedules himself, writing them out on weekly library cards. A current highlight is 1970s episodes of Sunday Night at the London Palladium.Talking Pictures’ main audience is largely elderly, he says, with many viewers housebound or in care homes, but he’s also been surprised by the younger viewers gravitating to the channel. A recent bank holiday special featuring cult children’s films from the 70s including The Amazing Mr Blunden and Ring Of Bright Water got “brilliant figures”, he says, attracting parents who were children back then, and their kids and grandchildren.Talking Pictures recently held a fascinating collaboration with the Imperial War Museum, showing old movies and public information films and it often screens shorts from public archives, as well as private films: one of a family holidaying in Brighton was recently shown mid-afternoon. Cronin loves films that show off parts of British culture that have been forgotten. He mentions Hindle Wakes, a 1952 British drama set in Blackpool and Llandudno, shown on the station last August, featuring packed beaches and dancehalls from that era. “You very rarely get to see those aspects of those times, and as for the private films, it’s the kind of stuff that many people have thrown away. But when you get to see how your grandma and grandpa would have really experienced life, that’s great.”The business is run in a gloriously old-fashioned way. Its enthusiastic newsletters are launched every Tuesday, with a printable option, so viewers can read them away from screens. The channel tops up revenue from adverts by releasing DVDs through its Renown Films imprint, and selling merchandise such as Joan Collins and Diana Dors compact mirrors. Although the year ahead looks tough, with the advertising market crashing, they are determined to keep the station free of charge. Also, they’d never consider showing bigger films, “stuff like Where Eagles Dare”, Cronin-Stanley says. “That’s not us. We’re more about the things people have forgotten, then realise how much they love.”Before lockdown, Talking Pictures fans would occasionally find their address (they won’t ulge it today) and make pilgrimages, expecting a much grander HQ. “They think they’re going to find a fancy cinema, or a shop, or meet a projectionist,” says Cronin-Stanley. Now they are getting many emails a day saying thank you for the service they’re providing. “Some break my heart really. Carers saying we don’t know what we would do without you. You transport the people we love to a time they remember, to a time that they feel safe.”As for the station’s forthcoming fifth birthday celebrations, “Me and dad might have a cake, I suppose,” says Cronin-Stanley. “Or a cup of tea and a cream bun.”• Talking Pictures TV is on Freeview channel 81, Virgin 445, Freesat 306, and Sky 3281.

How they handle the pandemic may well be crucial this November tooThey were the battleground states that handed the White House keys to Donald Trump by a whisker. Now they are the battleground states of the coronavirus pandemic, microcosms of a crisis that, far from bringing America together, threatens to tear it apart.“We have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit,” Trump told workers at a medical supply distribution hub in Allentown this week. “You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they want to keep them closed. Can’t do that.”On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators descended on Pennsylvania’s state capitol in Harrisburg to protest the stay-at-home order from Governor Tom Wolf. Pennsylvania ranks 12th among states in Covid-19 cases per capita, according to a Reuters tally.In Wisconsin, meanwhile, the state supreme court’s conservative majority this week struck down a stay-at-home order extension issued by Governor Tony Evers. “We’re the Wild West,” he said despairingly. Trump was quick to describe it as a “win” over the “Democrat Governor”, tweeting: “The people want to get on with their lives. The place is bustling!” Indeed, photos of crowded bars quickly appeared on social media.Following Wisconsin’s lead, on Friday Republicans who control the state legislature in Michigan urged a judge to strike down stay-at-home orders and restrictions on businesses imposed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Republicans complain that her approach is overly cautious, particularly in areas that have not been hit as hard with the virus as the Detroit area, which has two thirds of the state’s cases.Armed protesters, some with Confederate flags and Trump regalia, have gathered at the Michigan state capitol in Lansing over the past three weeks. On Thursday a legislative session was cancelled to avoid a repeat of a recent incident in which gun-toting demonstrators crowded inside the building.Clinton tweeted: “Armed men storming a legislature to disrupt its democratic proceedings is domestic terrorism. It cannot be tolerated.” A man was charged with terrorism, accused of death threats against Whitmer.The protesters have been endorsed by Trump, who at one point tweeted “Liberate Michigan”, guaranteeing outsized media exposure despite polls showing a majority in favour of restrictions on businesses, schools and social gatherings, despite mass job losses.Neil Sroka, a city council member in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan, said: “Frankly, the right wing agitators that were trying to pull a stunt with these protests really put their foot in their mouth by having folks marching around with weapons.“Everyone is frustrated at being cooped up in their house, and certainly the weather here in Michigan hasn’t helped, but those folks that were protesting in the capitol do not reflect the views of anywhere close to a majority of people in my community and Michiganders in general.”Sroka, who is also spokesperson for the progressive group Democracy for America, said partisan isions over the issue are beginning to emerge, though they remain relatively modest. But he was “shocked” by this week’s events across Lake Michigan in Wisconsin.“Experiencing the deaths that we have here in the Detroit area and then seeing pictures from people crowding into bars over the last couple of days is just horrifying,” he continued. “You can’t be here in Wayne County, Michigan, and not feel the aura of death. Seeing the crowds in a place like Wisconsin just hours after the ban was lifted, there is a real disjointedness and a sense that parts of America may not understand what it’s like to be living through this.”Wisconsin had already stunned observers last month when Evers was again overruled by Republicans who forced a primary election to go ahead, leaving people in face masks to line up for hours to cast ballots. Critics described it as a chilling consequence of aggressive gerrymandering, which all but guarantees Republicans a legislative majority.Ed Fallone, a Marquette University Law School professor who unsuccessfully ran for the Wisconsin supreme court as a Democrat, said: “We’ve had two Wisconsin supreme court decisions that undermine the Democratic governor’s authority and now it’s fully expected that even local jurisdictions that have in place countywide or citywide stay-at-home orders will have litigation brought against them. It’s pretty much Democrat versus Republican, top-to-bottom.”Reports suggest that the pandemic has been sucked into America’s political polarisation and culture wars.Many protesters, taking their lead from Trump, refuse to wear face masks or maintain physical distance. “Science is no match for tribalism in this dysfunctional country,” wrote Frank Bruni, a New York Times columnist. “And protective masks, God help us, are tribal totems.”Fallone has seen evidence of the trend in Wisconsin. “I’m on various political Facebook groups throughout Wisconsin and you can see on social media the difference between people who react when they run into folks who aren’t wearing face masks and who are upset about it, and then other folks who are mocking anyone who tries to social distance,” he said.“It’s become very political. People take their cues from their leaders and so, on the Republican side, people are taking their cues from the Trump administration and the state Republican party leaders who are consistently talking about freedom and liberty and go where you want, do what you want. And on the Democrat side, people are trying to follow the governor’s recommendations and engage in social distancing and wear face masks.”Confirmed coronavirus cases in Michigan crossed 50,000 while Covid-19 deaths rose slightly to 4,825, the state health department said on Friday. More than 11,000 cases had been identified in Wisconsin as of Thursday night, according to a New York Times database, and at least 434 people had died. More than 63,000 cases had been identified in Pennsylvania as of Thursday night, along with about 4,300 deaths, the Times reported.Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus. Democratic governors across the country have generally urged caution, particularly in major cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the US – more than any other country in the world. “Vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back,” Trump said in the White House rose garden on Friday while announcing a major US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine.Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.“And in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It’d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan. He’s basically saying, ‘I got you to the promised land economically once, I will get you back to the promised land economically again’.Schiller added: “Trump will run on a message of hope from now until November, and he’ll basically dare the Democrats to prove him wrong. And then he’ll say, ‘You don’t believe in America. You’re betting against America.’“It’s a very interesting corner that he’s boxing the Democrats into and I think they’re hoping that people realise that the mismanagement of messaging on Covid and additional things like tariffs against China and supply chains undermine Trump, but those are very sophisticated arguments to make. When the Democrats have to make sophisticated arguments, the Democrats lose. The good news for the Democrats, the only saving grace, is that Joe Biden can speak swing state language.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/528a80d5119aeff64856ec837fdd7d06a2beb0c1/0_160_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bfa2138a2d688fa81194f971da72c4e","title":"atlanta mayor keisha lance bottoms coronavirus","story":"The Democratic mayor of Georgia’s capital discusses Covid-19, Ahmaud Arbery’s tragic death and a possible White House runAtlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, comes on the line, introduced by one of her communications team, with a non-committal, “Hi there. How are you?”Her tone is light yet detached after weeks of phone and video interviews.But when the topic turns to her four children, the motherly lilt returns to her voice. She’s having a hard time keeping her kids off YouTube and TikTok, she says. “Thankfully, there’s one week left of school. So I think I’m more excited than they are.”Like millions of other Americans, Bottoms has juggled working from home while keeping her children educated and entertained. Unlike most other Americans, Bottoms is running one of America’s largest cities, Atlanta, in the middle of a pandemic – one that has disproportionately affected African Americans nationwide and in her majority-black city.On top of those worries, she’s been involved a public disagreement with Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, after he embarked on a controversial plan to reopen the state – despite its infection rate still rising. The plan was seen as so risky even Donald Trump urged him not to do it. It also pitted a white governor against a black mayor.Now Atlanta’s plight under Bottoms has been in the national headlines for weeks as millions of Americans monitor its trajectory of coronavirus cases and deaths. Bottoms has made the rounds on TV expressing her opposition to Kemp’s proposals.“I don’t think it was appropriate to begin with tattoo parlours, massage parlours, bowling alleys and barber shops, and so on. I think a more thoughtful approach would have been in cases where people could socially distance,” she says.In response to her criticism of Kemp’s partial reopening, Bottoms received a racist text calling her the N-word, which, she says, her daughter saw over her shoulder.She has tried bringing up concerns with Kemp, she says, requesting he require people to wear masks in places it might be impossible to socially distance, or where there might be crowds of 10 or more people in Atlanta, Georgia’s capital and largest city. But he refused, she says.Bottoms in 2017 became the mayor of Atlanta – a city that has only had exclusively black mayors since the mid-1970s. Her victory came from predominantly black neighborhoods in the city’s southern half. In the celebrated cultural capital for African Americans, she spoke about an “enormous amount of racial distrust”. Now, as she gains national attention for denouncing Kemp’s leadership, her name has come up as a potential running mate for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.Bottoms is the daughter of the famous R\u0026ampB singer Major Lance, and was born and raised in Atlanta. In her YouTube video biography, she tells the story of how her grandparents came to Atlanta on a horse and buggy. Her childhood was far from idyllic, and something she has not shied away from speaking about on the campaign trail in 2017: she came home from school aged eight to her father being led away in handcuffs, later jailed for drug dealing.She graduated from high school and went to university in Florida before returning home to study law. She became a prosecutor and then a judge before entering city politics representing her south-western, predominantly black corner of the city for eight years. Then she won the race to be mayor three years ago.Racial disharmony seems to come with the job. This weekend, after a 36-second video showed a black man shot by two white men as he jogged through a coastal Georgia neighbourhood, Bottoms called Ahmaud Arbery’s death a “lynching”, catching the nation’s attention as she accused Trump of inciting acts of racism.“It’s so fascinating to me that it reverberates in that way, because from my lens it is the assumption that everybody recognizes that it is a lynching,” Bottoms says. “There’s more interest in what I have to say as an African American mayor of a southern city. But I think my voice reflects the feelings of many across this country.”But when it comes to discussing allegations of voter suppression in Georgia in the 2018 elections, which primarily affected communities of color and garnered national attention, Bottoms dodges the conversation.Kemp, then the secretary of state, responsible for overseeing elections, ran against Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s first black nominee for governor. Kemp beat Abrams by just under 55,000 votes amid allegations he purged tens of thousands of eligible voters from the rolls.“You have to give people an opportunity to govern. So the results of these elections are: they were what they were,” Bottoms says. A moment later she adds: “Voter suppression is very real. We see it happening across this country. But I also think that there’s a responsibility for us to turn out in numbers across this country and vote in numbers so that there is no room for error.”Mostly, though, Bottoms has embraced her role as a Democratic mayor in a blue city in a red state during the Trump era. She affirmed that Atlanta would continue to welcome refugees after Trump said state and local government both had to consent to continue receiving them. She rejected Trump-announced Ice deportation raids set to hit Atlanta, calling them “cruel”.In 2019, she became one of the first Democrats to back a candidate to run against Trump, endorsing Biden hours after he floundered against Kamala Harris on the debate stage on the topic of “bussing” to end racial segregation. Bottoms joined Biden at national debates and joined him on the stump in the early primary states of Iowa and South Carolina.She’s a devoted loyalist to the former vice-president, not wavering as she defends him when the topic turns to ex-Biden staffer Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegations, which Biden has forcefully denied repeatedly. “The vice-president has been very clear that women should be taken seriously and they should be believed, but their story should also be vetted and that’s what’s happened with Tara Reade,” Bottoms says firmly. “She’s not been vilified by the vice-president.”No wonder her name has come up as a possible vice-president. Biden has committed to picking a female running mate.The powerful South Carolina black congressman Jim Clyburn pointed towards Bottoms as a pick, saying: “There is a young lady right there in Georgia who I think would make a tremendous VP candidate, and that’s the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms.”Bottoms said she was honored Clyburn spoke her name, but insists she hasn’t spoken to Biden or his team about the role.“I think that the vice-president deserves the opportunity to have the person on the ticket who will best propel him to victory in November,” she demurs. “There’s a very accomplished list of women we’ve seen publicly mentioned.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24bca06caf266e6447dc3360602d291c37d34402/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fce761cc227cb2a224a81d9148060496","title":"people who are shielding how do you feel about the new lockdown rules","story":"As restrictions ease for people who are not subject to health conditions, do you feel forgotten about, isolated or cut off?The UK government has set out its plan to leave lockdown, but the changes will not affect everyone equally.

Soldiers and police officers were deployed at the market to take the temperature of all traders and clients.“Markets were probably the biggest vector of infection which is why Peru’s quarantine did not work as it should have,” said Eduardo Zegarra, the principal investigator for Grade, a development thinktank in Lima.“These figures are a bombshell,” he said, calling on the government to shut down the markets and declare a sanitary emergency.Authorities in Lima have left most of the city’s 1,200-plus markets open, carrying out spot tests and sending infected vendors – most of whom were asymptomatic – to self-isolate at home or at government facilities.But Zegarra worried Lima’s huge wholesale markets were already “enormous hubs of infection”, particularly Santa Anita, Lima’s largest, where some 30,000 merchants, porters and suppliers distribute and sell around 8,000 tonnes of food per day.Dozens of infections and at least one death have been reported among the market’s porters and fears were growing that the virus could already have spread not only to thousands of retailers and customers but also to lorry drivers traveling between the city and the country.“I fear that could trigger a second wave of the pandemic,” said Zegarra, a former deputy mayor of Lima. “The contagion among merchants is terribly high and we don’t know how long they’ve had it or how many people they’ve passed it on to.”Coronavirus cases in Peru rose to more than 84,000 on Friday, with a death toll of 2,392, according to official figures. Only Brazil has a higher infection rate in Latin America, at 212,198 confirmed cases and 14,455 deaths on Friday, placing it sixth in the world, according to John Hopkins University.São Paulo’s CEAGESP wholesale market – one of the largest on the continent – has already seen “innumerable” cases and around 30 deaths from Covid-19, according to the president of the market suppliers’ union.“We are very sad about the deaths of these people – but if you consider 40,000 people who come here every day, it is quite low,” said Cláudio Furquim.Media reports have shown crowds of shoppers and workers at Brazilian markets, most them without masks. In a report by TV Record, Diego Hipólito said his uncle, a driver, went to the market daily and kept working when he fell sick with coronavirus symptoms before eventually dying. “I think he could have passed it on,” Hipólito said.Markets still occupy an important place in Latin American culture and economies – even as retail giants such as Walmart expand into the region. But that has also tied them closely to the spread of the disease.Colombia’s largest wholesale market, Corabastos, sits in the hardscrabble Kennedy neighbourhood of the capital Bogotá – currently centre of the country’s outbreak.The city’s health minister, Alejandro Gómez, admitted that local government could have done better but also stressed the importance of food supplies. “We cannot allow Corabastos to become a risk to the health of Bogotá, but neither can we allow food shortages,” he said.Jorge Colmenares, an opposition city councilman, tweeted: “Thanks to Bogota’s carelessness, the coronavirus has hit the food supply of millions of citizens.”At Mexico City’s mammoth Central de Abasto, which receives merchandise from around the country and in turn supplies markets throughout the capital, at least 25 cases of Covid-19 and two deaths have been reported, although local media suggested the true figure was much higher.After a brief lockdown, Mexico has already announced plans to re-open its economy, but while Cornejo was sympathetic with the urge to get back to work, he feared that the worst was still to come from the coronavirus.“Economically, it’s time to restart. But on the health side, I’m worried – I don’t think we’ve hit bottom,” he said.“I’ve lived through the H1N1 outbreak and earthquakes, but I’ve never experienced anything like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca248ef0b8f8179d19b279683f508879da9ffcb5/0_31_1240_744/master/1240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd09add10f7974cf8e7976e05987b4b7","title":"did singing together spread coronavirus to four choirs","story":"In Amsterdam, 102 members of one choir fell ill, and cases have been reported in Europe, America and the UK. But scientists cannot agree on the causeOn 8 March this year, the Amsterdam Mixed Choir gave a performance of Bach’s St John Passion in the city’s Concertgebouw auditorium. It was one of the last major classical concerts to be held in the Netherlands before the country went into Covid-19 lockdown.The performance had unexpected consequences. Days later, singers began to sicken, one by one, until 102 of 130 choristers had fallen ill with Covid-19. One 78-year-old died, as did three partners of choir members singers ended up in intensive care and conductor Paul Valk displayed serious symptoms.Nor was this the only major chorus to suffer from Covid-19. Members of the Skagit Valley Chorale, based in Washington State, met for a rehearsal in March and within three weeks, 45 of them had been diagnosed with the disease or had symptoms. Three were hospitalised and two died. Similarly 50 members of the Berlin Cathedral Choir contracted the coronavirus after a March rehearsal, and in England many members of the Voices of Yorkshire choir became infected with a Covid-like disease earlier this year.These alarming developments raise a critical question. Does public singing – not just in choirs, but at football matches or at birthday parties – help transmit the coronavirus that is the cause of Covid-19? Jamie Lloyd-Smith, an infectious diseases researcher at University College Los Angeles, said it was possible that an infected singer might disperse viral particles further than other infected iniduals. “One could imagine that really trying to project your voice would also project more droplets and aerosols,” he told the Los Angeles Times. In this way, the virus would cause increased numbers of infections.The idea is alarming. A traditional pastime imbued with widespread cultural importance appears to be posing a distinct threat to the health of singers, concert-goers, football fans and a host of others.But not all scientists agree with the idea that our musical appetites pose a health. In particular, fluid mechanics expert Professor Christian Kähler of the Military University, Munich was highly doubtful about the dangers posed by concerts and decided to conduct experiments in the wake of the Amsterdam outbreak to find out how far singers and musicians expel air and droplets.“I have been studying how droplets and aerosols behave for decades and I was very doubtful that musicians and singers were spreading the virus. So I decided to measure just how strong was the airflow from them,” Kahler told the Observer last week. “We studied singing in low and high frequencies and all sorts of things like that. We also studied different instruments. And based on the flow analysis we did of these performances we could clearly see what was going on.”And yes, one or two instruments did pose threats in terms of their powerful air flow and might spread virus particles dangerously if some form of protection was not added. In particular the flute is especially strong while the oboe and clarinet also posed problems. “The large wind instruments like the horn were not dangerous but the flute could be, it turned out. Its air flow is considerable.“However, we also found out that singing is quite safe. It was not the cause of the outbreaks of Covid-19 at these concerts ,” he said. “Air was only propelled about half a metre in front of a singer, and that is not far enough to cause the infection levels of these outbreaks.”Kähler said the virus was probably spread among chorus members because of their close proximity to each other before and after rehearsals and performances. As he pointed out: “These outbreaks among choir members all occurred during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, before lockdowns were imposed and before our minds were concentrated on the importance of social distancing. Choir members probably greeted each other with hugs, and shared drinks during breaks and talked closely with each other. That social behaviour was the real cause of these outbreaks, I believe.”This point was also stressed by Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “The evidence for a link with singing and spreading the virus may look compelling but is still anecdotal,” he said. “Without data from comparably large groups who interacted in the same way but didn’t sing, it’s hard to be certain that the singing was responsible.“The point is that we now live in a world where the constant need for risk evaluation is suddenly noticeable. Before, we did it all the time without thinking about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e7609e0a02bf659e7748861f5345436ea5f531/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7be5b144def086e15f03e54e23b4bffc","title":"europe plans a summer staycation after coronavirus lockdowns","story":"While France, Italy and Spain stay cautious and look for domestic tourists, Greece hopes to capitalise on its handling of the crisis by opening its doors in JulyAs the most popular country in the world for tourists, France has been hit harder than most by a drop in holidaymakers. Around 90 million people, the majority from Britain and Germany, visited last year. Almost half of them visited Paris, and 15 million headed to Disneyland – the most popular tourist attraction in Europe.Last week, France’s prime minister Edouard Philippe, announced an €18bn (£16bn) rescue package for the country’s tourism sector to combat the collapse in visitor numbers. “What is good for the tourism industry, is often good for the whole of France,” he said.Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said several times that Italians will be going on holiday this summer. Yesterday , the government approved a decree which will allow travel to and from abroad from June 3. Free travel within the country’s borders will also be permitted from the same day.Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback, but Conte has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections.Shops are due to open tomorrow and all movement within inidual regions will be allowed, meaning people can visit friends.The government is hoping to salvage the holiday season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks. Shops and restaurants across the country are preparing to reopen under strict social distancing and hygiene rules. National health authorities will monitor the situation to make sure infections are kept in check, the decree said.Angela GiuffridaSpain’s foreign minister, Arancha González Laya, warned at the end of April that the country would re-open to tourists only “when it’s in a position to guarantee tourists’ safety”.Everyone arriving in Spain from abroad since 15 May must undertake a two-week quarantine, with new arrivals allowed out only to buy food or medicine, seek medical attention, or on emergency grounds. The quarantine will remain in force while the state of emergency, declared on 14 March, endures – possibly until the end of June.The regions are emerging from lockdown at different rates . Hotels in some areas have been given permission to re-open – barring communal areas – but few have resumed business for lack of customers. Beaches could re-open in mid-June, but it remains to be seen how social distancing will be enforced.

To become fully rounded people, it is important that all young people are given meaningful access to a full version of history.”The competition comes before Windrush Day on 22 June. The organisers said teachers and parents schooling at home due to the lockdown could use the resources on its website to help young people learn more about the impact people of African descent have had on British history.“Teaching about our history, equality and ersity to promote a fully inclusive atmosphere in schools should be embedded into daily life in schools,” said secondary school teacher and equalities campaigner Niparun Nessa.“The goal is always to celebrate festivals and events such as Black History Month to highlight and embrace our community and not to make up for what is often forgotten and overlooked.”There is also a teacher’s competition to develop resources to be used as part of a permanent online library celebrating black history.The 100 Great Black Britons was created in 2003 in response to the BBC’s 100 Greatest Britons television series the year before, when no one of African descent was represented.

This lockdown has put that backwards.“If you really care about children, you’ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning. You will want them to have new opportunities. So look to your responsibilities.”The government has asked schools to prepare to open their doors to children from reception, year 1 and year 6 from next month.But some councils, including Liverpool, Hartlepool and Greater Manchester, have said they will not be implementing the plan.In a letter to parents, Liverpool’s director of children’s services, Steve Reddy, said: “Our guiding principle is that schools can only reopen to other pupils when it is safe to do so and not a moment before.”In the clearest explanation yet of the government’s rationale for its “stay alert” approach to the next phase of the crisis, Gove said it was impossible to eliminate completely the risk of catching Covid-19, unless people were kept “perpetually imprisoned in their homes”.“The whole point about life is that you need to manage risk,” he said. “We cannot have a situation where we keep our economy and our schools and our public services continually closed down, because the health consequences of doing so would be malign as well.”In a separate interview on Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Gove announced that the government had recruited 17,000 coronavirus contact tracers, and would be ready to roll out the system nationwide by the end of this month.Building up the ability to find and control new local outbreaks is a central part of the government’s approach to progressively reopening schools, and the wider economy.The outsourcing giant Serco was given the contract to recruit the call-centre workers needed to run the new system.The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, suggested last week that just 1,500 had been hired, but when Gove was asked for a number on Sunday, he said, “just over 17,000”.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, had suggested 18,000 contact tracers would be in place by the middle of this month.Gove heaped praise on Hancock, amid reports of a testy relationship between the health secretary and No 10. “We’re on course to meet that target. It’s more evidence that we have, in Matt, an energetic and determined health secretary who is throwing everything into the fight against this virus,” he said.The government gave up trying to track every case of Covid-19 in March, when the virus began circulating in the community, with the deputy chief medical officer for England Jenny Harries saying at the time: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.”But the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, and Hancock’s predecessor Jeremy Hunt have consistently called for community tracing.The government also announced this weekend a third large-scale study to track the progress of the virus, and try to establish how many people may have built up some immunity to it.Teaching unions have said the implementation of a testing and tracking system should be a precondition for schools reopening – so that inidual outbreaks can be controlled.The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, backed their stance on the BBC Marr show, saying: “We urge the government to publish the science, and to ensure the test, track and isolate is in place.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4246579.1588778994!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lonely lapwings and the secret world of non breeders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCuckoo at other bird’s nest: Most cuckoos of both sexes resemble some sort of hawk. Illustration: Michael Viney Early to my desk, I found the hillside seriously somnolent: the ewes still pillowed, their lambs close and dozing. The ocean gleamed with zig-zags of calm and the strand was as bare as the whole bank holiday Monday.But then, at the far ditch, a bird rose sharply into the air. Dark and floppy-winged, it flung itself aloft, climbing and circling house-high above the pasture, abruptly tumbling and plunging, then rising again – and again.Even without its distant, creaky cries, the flashes of white beneath the wings declared a cock lapwing in territorial display, new and exciting to me as I watched across the hedge. Wheatears and pipits in that rough meadow, yes, but breeding lapwings were new. Soon, however, in an odd lurch of hops from one fencepost to the next, the bird vanished and did not reappear. His solitary display, bereft of any female lapwing, had left him to wander on.Ireland’s lapwing, like the curlew and other ground-nesting waders, seem doomed to a dismal decline. Their breeding range in Ireland has halved and at the Shannon callows, once a stronghold, numbers are down by more than 80 per cent.BirdWatch Ireland, with Government support, is seeking help from citizen scientists in a national survey of breeding pairs: follow Project Lapwing on Twitter or at Bioersity Ireland.Meanwhile, my lonely lapwing set me thinking of all the birds in springtime that never find a mate. “Floaters” as ornithologists call them, have a largely unknown life. But now, from eagles to sparrows, their role in conserving bird populations is under growing study.‘Limit to multiplication’Floaters themselves are scarcely new – Darwin was aware of non-breeding birds. And one of Ireland’s finest field naturalists, Charles Moffat, was the first to hint at their significance. In a paper in the Irish Naturalist in 1903, on the spring rivalry of birds, Moffat offered “some views on the limit to multiplication”. They challenged the widespread idea that, for bird population to remain stable, up to 90 per cent of new young birds must die.Spring rivalry for territory, he argued, “results in such a parcelling out of land as must limit the number of breeding pairs to a fairly constant figure and prevent indefinite increase. . . at the same time condemning the less powerful iniduals to unproductiveness rather than death.”In what’s sometimes known as “Moffat’s Equilibrium”, non-breeders are available to fill nesting vacancies, a buffer that can protect populations from decline or extinction.Some floaters may hang around on the fringe of breeding territories, living secretive, unstudied lives or perhaps sneaking the odd “extra-pair copulation” as they wait for a vacant territory.In birds such as crows, swans and waders, non-breeders occur separately in flocks, sometimes of nearly half the population. Some may also act as “helpers” to active families. In Greenland, with ornithologist David Cabot, I watched as pairs of barnacle geese, marshalling their chicks against marauding Arctic foxes, were joined by non-breeding geese in a fierce, deterrent beating of wings.With May so much the month of the cuckoo, I inquired of Google Scholar as to the occurrence of male floaters: how many of them go on carolling in vain? But any such research eluded me. Spare females, I learned, do exist and may be hunted out of the territories of breeding cuckoo pairs.Notorious lifestyleTo describe them as pairs seems ill-fitting, given the notorious lifestyle in which the female lays her eggs in the nests of unwitting songbirds (in Ireland, mainly the meadow pipit).Indeed, the female is rarely seen, keeping well under cover between her swift and parasitic sorties, but also hunting the hairy caterpillars that most other birds reject. Her sex life can be arduous, given the frequent, pressing attention of the male, which can sometimes yield up to 25 eggs in a season. Females have been seen with two or more pursuers.Such sexual harassment has even been linked to the colour of their plumage. Most cuckoos of both sexes resemble some sort of hawk, with greyish back, barred underparts, long tail and direct, dashing flight. But some females are quite rufously brown, like their young.Experiments with decoy females have found that males “attempted to copulate more frequently and excessively with the grey morph”, suggesting evolution of the brownies as a female-only force for selection.As I write, early in May, no cuckoo has arrived on this side of the hill. The Burren and Connemara usually have the greatest density of pairs, but the species is rapidly declining in both islands.In the UK, the British Trust for Ornithology tracks the migration of five satellite-tagged cuckoos on their spring return from the forests of the Congo. It has a webpage that maps their routes, and on last inspection four of the birds had arrived in England in April.In Ireland, records in the whole island are collected by Dr Damien McFerran at the Ulster Museum (habitas.org.ukrecordssubmit-cuckoo-record).

Photograph: Brian LawlessPAThe Government has given the go-ahead for the first stage of lifting Covid-19 restrictions from Monday, May 18th. Under this initial phase of reopening the country, construction and other outdoor work will be permitted, some retail outlets such as hardware – but not homeware – shops will be allowed to open and groups of four people will be allowed to meet outdoors, once they observe social distancing.On Saturday the director of the national virus reference laboratory Dr Cillian de Gascun gave additional information about how the easing would operate. He also said people should still try and avoid visiting friends and family under phase one. So what is allowed from Monday? Can I pop over to my friend’s garden for a drink?According to official guidelines, yes, you can as long as no more than four people gather together. However, Dr de Gascun warned that meeting up in a back garden could result in visitors using bathroom or kitchen facilities which could lead to a further spread of the virus. “It’s just adding additional risk,” he told RTÉ’s Saturday with Cormac Ó hEadra programme. “If you’re handing me a beer that’s fine, it can go straight into the bin or you can leave it on the wall… but if you’re giving me utensils or delph from your house, I’m seeding the virus onto it.”How long can I hang out with friends and do we have to meet outdoors? The advice is not to spend longer than 15 minutes in close contact with people and to always leave two metres distance between once another. However, Dr de Gascun acknowledged that people would probably spend longer together so just to be careful to stay away from one another. Any meetings should take place outdoors unless you have a very large roomhall which enables social distancing. Can I visit one friend in the morning and another in the evening?Dr de Gascun advised people not to meet more than one social group in a day and to restrict interactions to a small number of friends and family for at least the next three weeks. When will we know whether lifting the restrictions has impacted on the spread of the virus?It will take between 5-7 days before the impact becomes clear, said Dr De Gascun. “It’s going to be week two by the time we see what effect lifting restrictions has had. That’s why we wanted a three week period so we can analyse the first two weeks.”“The only way we can prevent people dying is by quenching virus activity in the community. So the community really is where everything starts and that’s where we want people to stay at home and minimise their interactions because any increase in cases in the community will have a knock on effect to hospitalization.”Dr de Gascun said it was “likely” there would be an increase in cases following the lifting of restrictions due to people’s increased movement and social interactions. Why is the wearing of masks on public transport and in supermarkets only being advised and not compulsory?Dr de Gascun said the Government was reluctant to make mask wearing mandatory as certain people may have problems wearing face coverings because of breathing difficulties or allergies. Others may need to see people’s mouths for lip reading, he added. Dr Holohan warned on Friday that “we cannot regard face coverings as some sort of magic shield . . . It’s a supplement to the other measures we are recommending.”“This is an additional hygiene measure, it’s not a magic bullet for this disease, and that has to be understood.”However, the National Transport Authority has urged people to wear masks when using public transport. What ever happened to the contact tracing app the Government was talking about a few weeks ago?When asked about this on Saturday, Dr de Gascun initially said he understood that plans for the app had “drifted” before correcting himself and saying he wasn’t involved in its development but he believed it would be ready but the end of May.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe People should continue to avoid visiting friends’ homes and only socialise in outdoor, public locations, the director of the national virus reference laboratory Dr Cillian de Gascun said on Saturday. From Monday, the State will begin the first stage of lifting the Covid-19 restrictions which have brought commercial and social life to a halt since March.Under this first phase of re-opening the country, groups of four people may meet outdoors once they observe social distancing, according to Government guidelines. However, Dr de Gascun urged people not to become complacent about social distancing when meeting friends and warned that gathering in people’s gardens could lead to visitors using bathroom and kitchen facilities. He also cautioned against using people’s glasses or cutlery when visiting friends. “It’s just adding additional risk,” Dr De Gascún told RTÉ’s Saturday with Cormac Ó hEadra programme. “If you’re handing me a beer that’s fine, it can go straight into the bin or you can leave it on the wall… but if you’re giving me utensils or delph from your house, I’m seeding the virus on it.”People should avoid interactions over 15 minutes and not meet multiple groups of people in one day, he said. He also advised that people restrict their social interactions to a small circle of friends and family in the coming weeks. Dr de Gascun said it was “likely” there would be an increase in cases following the lifting of restrictions due to people’s movement but that the full impact would not become clear for at least five days. “It’s going to be week two by the time we see what effect lifting restrictions has had.

So the community really is where everything starts and that’s where we want people to stay at home and minimize their interactions because any increase in cases in the community will have a knock on effect to hospitalisation.”Prof Gerry Killeen from UCC’s school of biological earth and environmental sciences, who has worked on malaria transmission control and methods to combat the Zika virus, said it was “absolutely” too soon to be lifting restrictions and that they should remain in place until the end of the summer or early autumn. International data indicates the death rate in Italy and New York is “still the tip of the iceberg of what would happen if we just let this epidemic rip”, he said. Prof Killeen cautioned that while testing and treatment was a vital part of the response to the virus, it would not hold back the spread of the pandemic. Public transport The National Transport Authority (NTA) has said it will continue to operate a revised timetable for bus, train and tram transport services from next Monday with extra capacity to be added across public transport as required.All passengers are advised to wear face coverings when using public transport from next week following Government advice that people use facemasks in crowded indoor locations and when on public transportation as restrictions are lifted. Asked why the wearing of masks on public transport had not been made compulsory, Dr de Gascun said certain people may have problems wearing face coverings because of breathing difficulties or allergies while others may need to see people’s mouths for lip reading. Dr Holohan warned on Friday that “we cannot regard face coverings as some sort of magic shield . . . It’s a supplement to the other measures we are recommending.”“This is an additional hygiene measure, it’s not a magic bullet for this disease, and that has to be understood.”NTA chief executive Anne Graham urged people to only use public transport if their “journey is essential” and to otherwise considering cycling or walking to their destination where feasible.“If public transport is their only option, they should follow public health guidance when travelling,” Ms Graham said. The NTA said any anticipated increase in passenger numbers would be “closely monitored” and that “enhanced daily cleaning” would continue to take place including the daily sanitising of frequently touched surfaces on board all vehicles and at depots and terminal points across the country. Almost all buses, trains and trams are now receiving at least one additional cycle of cleaning during the day, a statement from the transport authority said. The NTA said it would publish proposals “shortly” around the provision of enhanced public transport services in line with the Government’s roadmap for reopening society and that any decisions would be guided by the National Public Health Emergency Team and advice from the chief medical officers. The deaths of a further 16 people from Covid-19 were confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Friday night as well as an additional 129 cases.There has been anxiety in Government that people will “descend on hardware stores and garden centres in large numbers” once the rules are relaxed on Monday, resulting in a rise in rates of infection.At a press conference in Government Buildings on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar – flanked by Minister for Health Simon Harris, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys and chief medical officer Tony Holohan – said it was a “calculated evidence-based risk to ease the lockdown”.The first phase of the reopening of the country will see construction and other outdoor work permitted, some retail outlets such as hardware – but not homeware – shops allowed to open their doors. Retailers expressed disappointment at the late exclusion of homeware stores but Mr Harris said “now is not the time to decide I’m going to dicky up the house”.Dublin City Council has confirmed that from Monday, allotments, car parks associated with outdoor amenities, tennis courts and golf courses at Silloge and Tolka valley will re-open. The causeway road to the Bull Island Nature Reserve will re-open to vehicles along with a new dedicate cycleway while the number of outdoor staff at work across all service areas will increase. Arrangements are also being made for people returning to work in construction, said the council.

It wants protections of environmental standards and labour rights to be part of the deal, to avoid British industry undercutting EU competitors.Mr Frost said such commitments would bind Britain to EU laws and standards in a way that is unprecedented in other free trade agreements.“It is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on June 1st. In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU’s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail,” he said.Both sides agreed that there had been slight movement on the issue of fisheries, where each had begun with polar opposite positions, the EU advocating for a continuance of the status quo and Britain insisting it would reclaim exclusive rights for its fishing industry alone in its territorial waters.\u0026nbspTalks on finding a compromise will resume in the next round of negotiations, which begin on June 1st.Britain will next week publish the draft legal texts it has shared with EU negotiators but not with member-state governments. It will also publish a document outlining how it plans to implement the Northern Ireland protocol.‘A bit tetchy’A senior British official close to the negotiations said this week’s talks were “a bit tetchy at times”, adding that Mr Barnier was doing a good job but was burdened with a negotiating mandate that was not negotiable with Britain.“The problem continues to be that the EU think that they can get a halfway house between what we’re willing to see on so-called level playing field and what they’re willing to see, what we’re willing to live with on fisheries and what they’re wanting to see. We tried to make clear from the start that there isn’t a halfway house. You can’t split the difference between areas where we control our own laws and that’s a fundamental difficulty that the EU has not yet accepted,” the official said.After weeks of stalemate and a tight negotiating timetable that was curtailed further by the coronavirus pandemic, calls have grown for Britain to request an extension to the transition period to give the talks more time, which survey data indicates has majority public support.\u0026nbspThe British Irish chamber of commerce appealed to the government of prime minister Boris Johnson to buy time so that businesses were not burdened with tariffs and regulations while at their “most vulnerable”.The British government has insisted it will not ask for an extension, and last week cabinet minister Michael Gove said that tariffs were a “price” London was willing to pay.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty Europe’s chief Brexit negotiator has been told there is “significant opposition” to the UK government’s refusal to consider extending the timetable for talks.Both the SNP leader at Westminster Ian Blackford and the acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey have signed a letter to Michel Barnier, supporting an extension to the transition period.Such a move would allow talks to place when “the efforts of national governments and the European Union will not be engaged solely with dealing with the dreadful Covid-19 epidemic”, they said.With the UK having formally quit the European Union, talks are taking place between the UK and EU to determine key areas such as future trading relationships.But with the transition period due to expire at the end of this year, there are fears the UK may be forced into a no-deal scenario, if an agreement cannot be reached.The letter to Mr Barnier has also been signed by Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts, Green MP Caroline Lucas, Stephen Farry, MP from the Alliance Party, as well as fellow Northern Ireland MP Colum Eastwood of the Social Democratic and Labour Party. They contacted Mr Barnier to highlight the “significant opposition to the UK government’s extreme position amongst the business community, the general public and elected representatives”.The opposition MPs noted the Scottish and Welsh governments both backed an extension of the transition period, along with “the majority of political parties in the Northern Ireland Executive”.The MPs said: “A consensus is taking shape and we hope the UK Government will soon recognise reality.“It is now in all of our common interests to agree and secure an extension to the transition period. This will enable these detailed and defining negotiations to be conducted at a time when, we hope, the efforts of national governments and the European Union will not be engaged solely with dealing with the dreadful Covid-19 epidemic.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said they had written to Mr Barnier because “time is running out until we hit the hard Brexit deadline”.He insisted: “It is vital that the Tory government does the only responsible thing and accepts a two-year extension to the transition period.”The SNP MP continued: “Crashing out with a bad deal or no deal in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, would deal a double hammer blow to the economy just when we will need all the help we can get to save jobs, businesses and living standards.”But he claimed: “It increasingly appears the Tory government is intent on taking Scotland and the UK down the path of a devastating no-deal. That would be beyond reckless.“The coronavirus economic crash is the worst in living memory. People and businesses are already struggling to get by. The Tory government must put its responsibilities to the economy ahead of its Brexit obsession.“Polls consistently show that the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland and across the UK want to see an extension to the Brexit transition period — and there is growing consensus across political parties. It’s time for the UK Government to act.”A UK government spokesman said: “The government was elected on a manifesto which made clear the transition period would end on December 31st, 2020. That is enshrined in primary legislation and it remains our policy.“We will not ask to extend the transition period, and if the EU asks we will say no.“Extending the transition period would simply increase uncertainty and prolong the negotiations, whilst also leaving us bound by EU legislation and obliged to make further payments into the EU budget.” - PA Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

We are seeing a roughly similar pattern everywhere - I suspect we have more immunity than estimated. We need to keep slowing the virus, but it could be petering out by itself.Professor Sikora\u0027s comments come as Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, today (Sunday) announced that the Government would be investing £93m in the construction of the UK\u0027s first dedicated Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), to be opened in summer next year, 12 months ahead of schedule.A further £38m is being invested in creating a rapid deployment facility in the coming weeks, with the aim of ensuring any successful vaccine developed can be quickly distributed.The VMIC, located on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire, will have the capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months, the Government has said.Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, described the VMIC as an essential new weapon in the UK\u0027s arsenal which will provide a boost in the race to develop a vaccine by scientists at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.Mr Sharma said we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions when the breakthrough comes, and this funding will help make that happen.The VMIC\u0027s chief executive, Dr Matthew Duchars, added: “This investment will rapidly accelerate the construction of the facility, enabling us to bring it online a year sooner. In addition, the capacity will be significantly increased, so that enough vaccines could be made for everyone in the UK within a matter of months of opening.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously admitted that an effective coronavirus vaccine may never be found.Speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Monday evening, Mr Johnson said: This is by no means guaranteed. I believe I\u0027m right in saying that even after 18 years we still don\u0027t have a vaccine for Sars.What I can tell you is that the UK is at the forefront of concerting international activity to try to deliver a vaccine.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus going undetected one four people symptoms","story":"Coronavirus may be going undetected in one in four people with symptoms, because they exhibit signs of the virus other than a persistent cough or high temperature, ministers have been warned.Scientists on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which has been helping to shape the Government\u0027s response to Covid-19, expressed concern that iniduals with only lesser-known symptoms, such as a loss of smell, fatigue, or muscle ache, may not be self-isolating and receiving tests for the disease.Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, who sits on Nervtag, said it was important that patients and doctors had a wider perception of how coronavirus can present itself. He also pointed out that the swab test typically used to establish whether a patient has Covid-19 may be less likely to detect infection in cases where the disease is primarily causing symptoms elsewhere in the body, such as the digestive system, rather than the nose and lungs.Official guidance describes new continuous cough andor high temperature as the most common symptoms, and states that those with such symptoms should stay at home for seven days.But Flusurvey, a system run by Public Health England using data from more than 8,000 people, shows a greater number of people reporting a loss of smell than those stating that they have a combination of a fever and a cough.At a Nervtag meeting on March 13, the day after Boris Johnson first instructed those with a cough or high temperature to stay at home, scientists raised concerns that a number of iniduals with the virus may not meet the definition.There was concern that the phraseology might mean that a number of iniduals with the virus may not meet the definition. JE was working off a recent paper that could mean that 1 in 4 cases could be missed if the criteria of only a cough andor fever are used and this is if there was 100 per cent compliance to the current definition, which is unlikely.The minutes note that one study had identified fatigue and muscle ache as two other main symptoms and the panel agreed to monitor whether the case definition is fit for purpose.Prof Openshaw said: In the self-reported symptoms, as discovered by the apps, anosmia, the loss of sense of smell comes out as a very, very frequent one. But in terms of how often that would actually lead to a diagnosis of Covid, that\u0027s not quite clear.He added: So at the moment, there\u0027s not necessarily a strong case for expanding beyond the fever and cough when it comes to self-isolation - those are still very prominent and important presenting symptoms - but I think we are, over time, appreciating that it\u0027s a much more diffuse disease presenting in many different ways.I think it is important that people do have a wider perception of how it may present. The original, very restrictive definition, I think was not picking up a lot of people who actually might have Covid.Prof Openshaw confirmed that one in four cases could still easily be missed as a result of the focus on coughing and high temperatures.  Officials maintain that they used the best available data to establish the most likely symptoms, before anyone with a new cough or fever was first asked to isolate, in March. But the UK\u0027s position was at odds with France, where people with loss of taste and smell were being advised to consider self-isolating even if they lack the main two symptoms.On March 26 it emerged that Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, was considering designating taste and smell deprivation a symptom of coronavirus, as the World Health Organization announced it was probing the link. Anecdotal reports from northern Italy had suggested that as many as 50 per cent of doctors involved in fighting the virus temporarily lost the faculties.But last month, Jonathan Van-Tam, his deputy, said: There is some anecdotal data in the published domain that there is a proportion of people who do indeed lose their sense of taste and smell.However, we have looked at the data there is, in relation to whether that on its own is a symptom that would be important to add to the case definition, and the answer to that from our experts is absolutely not.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “The symptoms selected were those that captured those most likely to have covid-19, while not capturing a great number of people who did not.“We continue to keep symptoms under expert scientific review as we strengthen our understanding of the virus.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dithering officials holding back next wave innovation","story":"At the start of the pandemic, China built a hospital in double-quick time and we all thought, “that’s why they are so good at economic growth”. Then Britain did the same, proving we can do it too. Medical devices have been rushed through the approval process in days. Vaccine development is being brilliantly accelerated. We have shown we can do things quickly. Why can’t we do the same in ordinary times?Like every small business owner, I find that quangos always take far, far longer than they need over decisions.A local river trust cleaning out an old fish-pass on a river took several months to get approval from the Environment Agency the work took one day. An attempt to turn derelict farm buildings into shops has so far taken local planning officials seven years to (not yet) decide.Getting permission to extend a track by a hundred yards took Natural England many months of hesitation and several site visits.The problem that faces firms up and down the country is not that regulators say no, but that they take an age to say yes. A local firm has been trying to start a project that would bring 200 good jobs and millions of pounds of tax revenue. It has been through planning permission, an inquiry, an appeal and a court case – winning at every stage. It was promised a ministerial decision last June and is still waiting, five years after applying.From Heathrow Airport’s new runway to notifying you of a medical test result, everything seems to take far longer than necessary.For private enterprise, time is money delay can be lethal. Companies like Amazon, for all their faults, recognise this and promise you rapid delivery. For the public sector, there is no urgency. If the rules state that you must receive a reply within three weeks, then lo and behold, the reply arrives after three weeks, never two.It can take up to six years to get a medical device – a new and faster diagnostic test for viruses, say – licensed in most European countries, including this one. Entrepreneurs cannot wait that long their money runs out. We will never know how many innovations such delays have deterred, but they are surely one of the main reasons we were not better prepared for this pandemic.In 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved a genetically modified variety of potato bred by the German company BASF.The European Commission decided not to decide. So BASF went to court and won. The commission launched another evaluation. The EFSA once again said the potato was safe. But the Hungarian government complained the EU had based its decision on the first approval, instead of the second virtually identical one. A court agreed.By this time, eight years had passed and BASF had tired of banging its head against a brick wall. It withdrew its application, packed up its research team and moved them to America.Instead of raging against the machine, we shrug and treat these delays like the weather we dare not grumble for fear of incurring a further bureaucratic sulk. The trouble is, delay costs civil servants nothing. Indeed, it brings advantages. Not taking a decision increases the chances that you’ll be promoted or moved so the blame for the decision – if it proves unpopular – falls on your successor.Plus the delay enables them to argue they are overworked and under-resourced, so need a bigger budget. This is known as public choice theory.The Highways Agency is planning a road-widening scheme through a sliver of woodland I own. Fine, go ahead, say I. It’s been on the cards for a decade, planned for five years and an active project for two. But no ground has been broken.Ecologists with high-vis jackets and clipboards keep coming out to survey the habitat, the otters, protected species and trees. There is a separate ecologist wearing a high-vis jacket in a separate van for each category.They are now making second or third visits because, they say, too long has elapsed since the first one and they need to check if the trees are still there. The road will be built anyway. But notice: the more visits, the more these ecological consultants earn.China is a dictatorship, but if you don’t annoy the Communist Party, you’re far more free to put up a building, start a research project or open a shop without interminable waits for beadles and busybodies to give you licences. If there is one way to regain rapid growth after Covid, it is surely to incentivise officials to take decisions more quickly. I wish I could think of a way to do that which won’t immediately be gamed, but there must be one.

Increasing numbers of fish and chip shops are reopening with some selling record numbers of take-away meals as one of the nation’s favourite culinary treats enjoys a resurgence in popularity.The National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF) estimates nearly 80 per cent of the country’s 10,500 shops have begun trading again as they embrace new technology and social distancing guidelines.While cashless click and collect mobile phone apps stagger collection times to prevent queues, a new kerbside car delivery technique means even the most vulnerable can enjoy crispy cod and chips.“For those shielding or self-isolating they can simply drive up to the fish and chip shop safely in their car, pop open their boot and we place the fish supper inside, close the boot and off home they drive,” said Andrew Crook, NFFF president and owner of Skippers of Euxton in Lancashire. “They don’t even have to open the window.”In the Cheshire town of Knutsford, friers at Hooked on the Heath have become accustomed to placing bags of fish and chips in the front bonnet of footballers’ sports cars.“With supercars they have to pop the bonnet at the front,” said Craig Buckley, the shop owner. “Recently, there was a Lamborghini Urus, two Porsches and a Land Rover in a line waiting for our fish and chips.”Mr Buckley would not say who the sporting superstars were, merely hinting how a lot of footballers who play for Liverpool and Manchester clubs live nearby.“It doesn’t matter who you are or how well off you are, everyone loves fish and chips,” he added.Fish and chips shops closed after the lockdown was announced, leaving farmers with stockpiles of markies and sagitta potatoes, the drier varieties perfect for chipping.When it became clear take-aways could reopen the industry worked with the Government to establish new guidelines.Now, staff working in the kitchens have to pass one another “back to back”, shops often have plastic shields and customers are only allowed inside one at a time, if at all. And cash is out with touchless credit cards, online and mobile phone apps with digital payments the new norm.In Galastonbury’s Knight’s Fish Restaurant, which has been in the same family since 1909, the take-away side of the business is now booming despite only being open nine hours a week.“Fish supper Friday is still the big take-away night - I think it cheers people up,” Kevin Mitchell, who married Charlotte Knight, said as he prepared to open up. “Orders can be big. We had a £70 order from someone buying dinner for the whole street. But, a lot of people are buying for elderly parents where they drop the food off on the doorstep.”This year is the 160th anniversary of the first fish and chips to be served as a complete dish, although it is disputed whether it originated in London or Mossley, near Manchester.Although, fried fish dates back much further with Charles Dickens referring to a “fried fish warehouse” in Oliver Twist, although then served with bread or baked potatoes. The coronavirus means National Fish and Chip Day has been put back from the first Friday in June to September 4.Mr Crook believes the crisis may have changed the industry for good. “People are still finding their feet,” Mr Crook added. “But we are emerging as a more modern industry.”A Defra spokesperson said delivery, take-away and drive-through outlets “play a key role in serving the public” and can open as long as they have strict social distancing procedures in place.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second wave coronavirus europe winter uk","story":"European countries should brace themselves for a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections because the pandemic is not over, the World Health Organisation’s top official in Europe has said. In an exclusive interview with The , Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, delivered a stark warning to countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions, saying that now is the time for preparation, not celebration.Dr Kluge stressed that, as the number of cases of Covid-19 in countries such as the UK, France and Italy was beginning to fall, it did not mean the pandemic was coming to an end. The epicentre of the European outbreak is now in the east, with the number of cases rising in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, he warned. Countries should use this time wisely and start to strengthen public health systems as well as building capacity in hospitals, primary care and intensive care units, he said. Singapore and Japan understood early on that this is not a time for celebration, it\u0027s a time for preparation. That\u0027s what Scandinavian countries are doing – they don\u0027t exclude a second wave, but they hope it will be localised and they can jump on it quickly,” said Dr Kluge.He also warned that a second wave could coincide with an outbreak of other infectious diseases.“I’m very concerned about a double wave – in the fall, we could have a second wave of Covid and another one of seasonal flu or measles. Two years ago we had 500,000 children who didn\u0027t have their first shot of the measles vaccine, he said. Many experts, including England\u0027s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, have warned that a second wave of the pandemic could be even deadlier than the first, pointing to the 1918-20 Spanish flu pandemic as evidence. When the Spanish flu first emerged in March 1918, it had the hallmarks of the typical seasonal illness – but it then came back in an even more virulent and deadly form in the autumn, eventually killing an estimated 50 million people.Troop movements at the end of the First World War are thought to have accelerated the spread of the disease, which also had a third and fourth wave although these were not as devastating.We know from history that in pandemics the countries that have not been hit early on can be hit in a second wave, said Dr Kluge. What are we going to see in Africa and Eastern Europe? They\u0027re behind the curve – some countries are saying: \u0027We\u0027re not like Italy\u0027 and then, two weeks later, boom! They can unfortunately get hit by a second wave, so we have to be very very careful.In the last couple of weeks, many European countries have started unlocking their shuttered economies and allowing some resumption of normal life.Earlier this month, the Spanish population was allowed to exercise outside for the first time in seven weeks, and restaurants in some areas of Germany have reopened. In France, people will no longer need travel permits to explain why they have left home.But in the absence of an effective treatment for the virus, or a vaccine, Dr Kluge said any lockdown had to be accompanied by rigorous public health measures including comprehensive contact tracing and testing. A pilot NHS contact tracing app was launched on the Isle of Wight last week, with the Government saying it would be rolled out to the rest of the country by the end of the month if it proves successful.The number of tests being carried out has been growing slowly but is still not at the 100,000-a day-level promised by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary. Analysis by the  shows that around 80,000 tests a day are being carried out. Dr Kluge said the lack of a treatment or vaccine meant any easing of lockdown restrictions had to be done gradually and carefully, adding: People think lockdown is finished. Nothing has changed. The full disease control package has to be in place. That\u0027s the key message. He said that he hoped the pandemic had shown that health should now be at the top of the political agenda.We always thought that health was the driver of economic prosperity, but it\u0027s worse – where there\u0027s no health, there’s no economy, he added. This is a lesson that cannot be forgotten. Public health deserves its place at the top of the agenda.

Just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question, and shoot him, if he doesn\u0027t submit to their question.Mr Obama later spoke at a second ceremony this one a star-studded prime-time event for high school students who are missing out on graduation pomp because of coronavirus.Mr Obama continued along the same lines, telling students to step up where leaders had failed.If the world is going to get better, it\u0027s going to be up to you, he said.Doing what feels good, what\u0027s convenient, what\u0027s easy - that\u0027s how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way - which is why things are so screwed up.I hope that instead, you decide to ground yourself in values that last, like honesty, hard work, responsibility, fairness, generosity, respect for others.The ceremony, carried by all the major American television networks, flashed between stirring speeches and performances students and celebrities alike, including basketball superstar Lebron James and singers the Jonas Brothers.Because of the global health crisis, traditional American high school and university graduation ceremonies, a popular rite of passage, are out of the question.So virtual ceremonies are taking their place.I\u0027ve always loved joining commencements - the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice, Mr Obama wrote on Twitter earlier this month.In keeping with tradition, America\u0027s first black president has up until now avoided publicly criticising his successor, despite frequently being attacked by Mr Trump.But earlier this month, in remarks leaked from a web call with people who worked in his administration, he called Mr Trump\u0027s handling of the pandemic a catastrophe.It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset - of \u0027what\u0027s in it for me\u0027 and \u0027to heck with everybody else\u0027 - when that mindset is operationalised in our government, he said in that call.The US leads the world with coronavirus cases and deaths, at 1.4 million and nearly 90,000, respectively.As this year\u0027s graduates enter a new chapter in life, they face a grim reality: the US unemployment rate has suddenly shot up to nearly 15 per cent and more than 36 million people have filed for unemployment benefits as America grapples with the fallout from months of lockdown and business closings.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"felicien kabuga captured africas wanted mastermind behind rwandan","story":"French police seized the man regarded as the intellectual and financial mastermind behind the Rwandan genocide on Saturday, ending a transcontinental 26-year manhunt for “the Eichmann of Africa”.Félicien Kabuga, Africa’s most wanted fugitive, was arrested in the northern outskirts of Paris after a dawn raid on his flat in the commune of Asnières-sur-Seine. Officers said the 84 year-old had been living there under an assumed identity.French authorities released few details about the operation, beyond hailing the capture of “one of the world’s most wanted fugitives”. It is believed that a series of simultaneous raids were carried out on addresses across France, some linked to Kabuga’s children, to ensure that he did not escape.Those familiar with the investigation suggested that the operation, at least in terms of the painstaking intelligence work involved, had echoes of the Mossad mission to seize the Nazi war criminal Adolph Eichmann from Buenos Aires in 1960.The British security services played an “essential” role in the operation that led to Kabuga’s capture, according to United Nations prosecutors. So, too, did investigators in the United States, which has long had a $5 million (£4.1m) bounty on his head, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland.Kabuga will not be sedated and spirited away to Rwanda in the way Eichmann was smuggled into Israel, where he was tried and hanged for his role as a primary architect of the Final Solution.Instead he will eventually be handed over to a United Nations tribunal to answer longstanding charges of crimes against humanity.Even so there will be considerable relief in Rwanda, where 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered over a 100-day period in 1994 — a massacre carried out by a cabal of Hutu extremists with Kabuga, one of the country’s richest men, allegedly at its core.Without the fortune he acquired through his tea and coffee estates, the genocide might never happened have happened. In 1992, Kabuga ploughed money into Radio Television Libres Milles Collines (RTLM), a radio station that steadily dripped hatred towards the country’s Tutsi minority.The following year, he allegedly began to import into the country hundreds of thousands of machetes, which were doled out to the Interahamwe, an extremist Hutu militia accused of overseeing much of the slaughter.As the genocide began, Interahamwe militiamen, wearing uniforms reportedly provided by Kabuga, were transported from killing site to killing site in his organisation’s vehicles, investigators say.Meanwhile, Radio Milles Collines provided the soundtrack of the genocide, urging Hutus to hunt down and kill the Tutsi “inyenzi”, or cockroaches. “The graves are only half full,” the station’s presenters would warn. “We must complete the task.”After the genocide, which ended when Tutsi rebels led by Paul Kagame, now Rwanda’s president, swept into the capital Kigali, Kabuga vanished.After a quarter of a century of leads that grew ever colder, many had given up hope of bringing him to justice.The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which tried 76 key genocide suspects, ceased operations on New Year’s Eve 2015 without ever laying its hands on the suspect many prosecutors most wanted to put in the dock.Instead, Kabuga will now be tried by the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, an obscure body created to mop up the unfinished business left behind by the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.For the body’s chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, the capture of Kabuga is a triumph as unalloyed as it is unexpected.“The arrest of Félicien Kabuga today is a reminder that those responsible for genocide can be brought to account, even twenty-six years after their crimes,” he said. “This arrest demonstrates the impressive results that can be achieved through international law enforcement and judicial cooperation.” But amid the relief in Rwanda there will also be anger that it has taken so long to hunt Kabuga down. According to UN officials, he had lived in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya during his years on the run. His move to France is thought to have happened in the last three years.How one of the world’s most wanted men managed to cross international borders with such ease remains an unanswered question. But money and connections almost certainly had something to do with it.The bulk of Kabuga’s years as a fugitive are thought to have been spent in Kenya. Here he is said to have enjoyed the protection of officials close to Daniel arap Moi, the former Kenyan president, who died in February.Moi was a close friend of Juvenal Habyarimana, the Hutu president whose killing on 6th April 1994 triggered the long-planned genocide. Two of Kabuga’s daughters married President Habyarimana’s sons, giving the tycoon close access to the Kenyan leader.According to a Kenyan government source, the FBI came close to arresting Kabuga shortly after Moi retired in 2002 when a local journalist, William Gichuki, walked into the US embassy in Nairobi and said he knew where the Rwandan was hiding.But before the FBI could act, Gichuki was murdered. Whether Kenyan intelligence had tipped Kabuga off is unclear. The US embassy never acknowledged its connection to Gichuki but it did release a pointed statement after Kenyan police showed reluctance to investigate his murder.Kenya’s apparent refusal to hand over Kabuga strained relations with the United States. In 2009, Barack Obama sent Stephen Rapp, his adviser on war crimes, to Kenya to deliver a public and pointed message to Moi’s successor, Mwai Kibaki. The US, Mr Rapp said, “had credible information on the fugitive’s location and the powerful people protecting him.”But the Kenyan government would not budge. In late 2017, a prominent human rights activist, Ken Wafula, told The Daily  that Kabuga had been tracked down to the Kenyan town of Eldoret by two men, the editor of a local newspaper and a whistleblower who had previously worked as an agent for the International Criminal Court.Both men were murdered. Wafula said he had approached the US embassy to share the fugitive’s whereabouts but was told that nothing could be done “because they didn’t trust the Kenyans”.“They were afraid I would be killed.”There is no way of corroborating Wafula’s account. Four months after speaking to The , he died from a short illness. Although there is no suggestion of foul play, it was common knowledge in Kenya not to look too closely into Kabuga’s whereabouts.“Anyone who looked too closely, anyone who got a tip and tried to act on it tended not to live too long,” a Kenyan senator said. “He had powerful connections and deep pockets.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no one immune economic storm come1","story":"I blame this blasted weather. It lulls us into thinking that we are passing through a sunlit dreamtime, a holiday from reality after which things will get back to normal. But things won’t get back to normal. Our problems are only just starting.Even if, either because we find a cure or many more of us turn out to be immune than was realised, we are able to lift the restrictions speedily, the damage has been done.Our economy is in collapse. We have taken on debt at a rate not seen since 1945. A new generation is about to learn what mass unemployment feels like. How, in the circumstances, can we be so relaxed about extending the closures? When every day in lockdown adds billions to our debt, and months, even years, to the eventual recovery, how can so many of us think it reasonable to leave things as they are “until we can be absolutely sure”?Why, when other European countries are firing up their economies, do we remain the most timorous of all the electorates polled?The answer, I think, can be found in a YouGov survey last week which asked people whether the lockdown was having a positive or a negative effect on various aspects of their lives.Most of the results were unsurprising: people thought that the impact on their family relationships was positive, the impact on their social lives negative, the impact on their diet and exercise neutral. But there was one especially telling response.Asked about their personal income, only 26 per cent of respondents felt the lockdown had made them worse off (with 21 per cent saying the effect was positive and 50 per cent saying it was neutral).Think about those figures for a moment. Closing down most economic activity is bound to make almost everyone poorer. That should be an obvious, indeed indisputable, statement.Look around you. Businesses are already going under, two million more people have been driven on to benefits, and the sums we are borrowing, hour by hour, will condemn us to decades of tax rises, inflation or both – which will in turn hit our productivity.No one is immune. If you’re a pensioner, your pension will lose its value. If you’re a public sector worker, you’ll find that, as its tax take evaporates, the Government can’t afford to pay you.If you have savings, they will be inflated away. If you’re a student, you’ll be working off these debts for the rest of your life.​Britain, as a whole, is perhaps 25 per cent poorer. Yet, so far, few of us are feeling it. That 26 per cent figure is a reminder that our economy is an inverted pyramid resting on a relatively small number of profitable enterprises. The rest of the population – whether state employees on full pay or furloughed workers who, without travel or childcare costs, are no worse off – naturally find it easier to call for caution.“We need to put lives before the economy,” say the majority – as though the economy were some abstraction removed from human endeavour.Perhaps we can’t help thinking this way. We are flesh-and-blood creatures. We can picture getting sick much more easily than we can picture a fall in GDP.Only when that fall hits us directly, leaving us unable to afford the things we used to buy, will we understand that “the economy” is what we call the transactions people make to improve their lives.And, even then, we may struggle to link our misfortune to the closures we have spent the past two months demanding.Weather conditions along the lines of King Lear act three, scene two would be more appropriate. They might just give us a premonition of what is heading our way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pms obesity crusade must not abandon conservative principles","story":"In the clash of national sensibilities, Boris Johnson’s leanings have always seemed obvious. Our PM is every inch a Cavalier, a consummate Merrie Englander and sworn foe of hand-wringing puritans. His evident unease at announcing full lockdown measures seemed an appropriate response to dismantling our ancient liberties.Not anymore. The PM’s brush with death has reportedly sparked a Damascene conversion. Weighing 17.5 stone when he fell ill, the PM is convinced this extra upholstery exacerbated his life-threatening reaction to Covid-19, and now plans a more muscular anti-obesity drive. Despite little concrete detail so far, expanding Britain’s ‘sin taxes’ could play a central role. Former Chancellor George Osborne certainly welcomed the shift: “Good to see that the sugar tax I introduced in my 2016 Budget continues to win over those who opposed it”.What’s the problem? Though age remains the overwhelming risk factor, Britain’s high obesity levels will naturally spark calls for “something to be done”. Yet sin taxes have a patchy international record. Politicians, especially conservatives, should beware policies that disproportionately harm the poor, while scarcely affecting obesity rates. The focus should be on tackling the current pandemic.Granting themselves extra powers risks emboldening a bureaucracy in dire need of change. Public Health England, the body overseeing our response, has had a terrible war doling out catastrophic advice on care homes, and failing to collaborate with private sector firms on testing.Their obsession with micro-managing our diets arguably blinded them to the real dangers while PHE officials were campaigning to remove Tony the Tiger from cereal packs, they failed to anticipate the looming global health crisis. Doubling down on nanny statism now will suggest the government has learned little from this experience.The shift towards statism bodes ill when the Treasury is abandoning fiscal prudence elsewhere. Last week, the PM talked of stimulating growth through infrastructure spending (in fact, Ministers should be compiling a list of costly and misguided projects to axe, starting with HS2). He has promised to protect public sector pay under all circumstances and seems worryingly reluctant to accept that boosting public sector wages means pay cuts for wealth-generators. It may feel like a lifetime ago – but we had an election last December, and the public chose the Tories, not the Lib Dems.This is not to downplay the effects of Britain’s obesity crisis. But to me the problem appears cultural sedentary lifestyles, and a level of food illiteracy that would horrify previous generations. Prioritising exercise and education seems a more Johnsonian way than the blunt tool of sin taxes. Or better yet, the power of persuasion. His recovery gave public morale a resounding boost. Just imagine how the PM could stir a nation of couch potatoes by waging the Battle of the Bulge from the front.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel restrictions live uk hotels campsites holiday parks set","story":"UK campsites are preparing to reopen in JulyWhen can we go on holiday again?Can I take a UK holiday yet? Will holidays be cheaper after coronavirus?What are the rules for day-trips this weekend?When should I reschedule my holiday?UK campsites, hotels, holiday parks and tourist attractions are paving the way for a summer reopening, after the Prime Minister eased lockdown restrictions last Sunday.Chances of an overseas summer holiday are dwindling after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a BBC interview that it was highly likely summer holidays would be “cancelled”.  The FCO continues to warn against all but essential travel.Hopes were scuppered further on Friday when the government confirmed there would be no UK–France travel agreement, excluding French arrivals from a 14-day quarantine, as had been previously suggested. However, the British tourism industry has responded to the loosening of lockdown by gearing up for a July 4 reopening.Robin Hutson, Chairman and Chief Executive of Lime Wood and the Pig Hotels, said: “In terms of reopening, all we can predict is that it is likely to be at some point between July and October, but without knowing exactly what social distancing measures we will need to observe it is not possible to anticipate when within that period it will be viable or desirable to reopen.”Campsites are taking bookings. Online campsite guide and reservations site, Cool Camping, reported an instant increase in bookings for July, August and September following the Prime Minister’s announcement on Sunday.  While there’s been no special mention of camping in the Government’s roadmap out of lockdown, it’s safe to assume that, along with the rest of the hospitality industry, campsites in England fall into step three of the plan.Dan Yates, Managing Director of Pitchup, said: “In short, with a date of \u0027no earlier\u0027 than July 4, time will be tight to capitalise on this summer. Typically, the peak begins in the third week of July with the start of the school holidays, and ends at August Bank Holiday. That said, we live in hope of an Indian summer.”“There does seem to be some pent-up demand for camping with consumers having waited for guidance that lockdown measures might be eased before booking,” said Cool Camping’s founder, Jonathan Knight.Holiday parks are preparing for a summer reopening, too. Center Parcs is set to extend the closure of its holiday parks in the UK and Ireland beyond June 11, but is looking into ways to reopen with social distancing measures in place. Haven is also preparing to reopen in the beginning of July, with limits on the number of people who can stay at its parks. Off on a day trip today? Looking for signs of when you\u0027ll be able to travel abroad? We will be posting rolling updates from around the world, as countries emerge from lockdown.In case you missed the news yesterday, the UK government has confirmed that everyone, including the French, will have to self-isolate for 14 days when arriving in the UK.This dampens hopes that UKFrance holidays could have been on the cards once the FCO lifts its travel warning.Read the full story here.Ministers are considering a blanket permission for restaurants and cafes to make use of public squares for stalls, reports Edward Malnick.Cafes, pubs and restaurants would be allowed to sell food and drink from street stalls within weeks and small church weddings could take place from July, under plans being considered by ministers to gradually ease the lockdown.Businesses that hold licences to have tables and chairs at the front of their premises are to be allowed to set up market-style stalls instead, as part of a bid to begin reviving high streets before pubs and eateries can begin opening their doors to customers, potentially in the summer.This comes after Vilnius last month became a giant open air cafe by allowing businesses to serve customers in temporary outdoor seating in public squares.Heathrow Airport has suggested new temperature screening technology could reduce the need for a 14-day quarantine for arrivals in the UK.The thermal imaging cameras, being trialed in Terminal 2,  are part of a wider set of measures being tested at the UK\u0027s biggest airport.If successful, the cameras could be deployed in the airport to detect anyone symptomatic of Covid-19. Thermal imaging technology in use at Bangkok Airport Two Italian teenagers have been fined for breaking the country\u0027s lockdown rules - because they kissed in the street, writes Erica Di Blasi in Turin.The two 18-year-olds were reported by the resident of an overlooking property who spotted their kiss and informed the police.The size of the fine is not known but under an earlier provision of the law relating to the lockdown, later repealed, they could have faced a three-month prison sentence.The offence took place in March in a street in Turin but has come to light only recently. The couple were spotted kissing at 2:30am by a resident who immediately called the police.The assistant prosecutor of Turin, Paolo Borgna, implicitly criticised the treatment of the couple. In an article in the Justice Question, a legal magazine, he said that while the lockdown measures were all right and, apart from a few excesses, all necessary, people should think about the risks that the boundless panic of today can have on our freedoms of tomorrow.  Restaurants and cafes will reopen in Greece on May 25, as the government continues to ease its coronavirus lockdown restrictionsThe reopening of these businesses comes a week earlier than the planned date of June 1. Shopping malls will also reopen tomorrow, two weeks earlier than scheduled.Yesterday, Greeks took to the beach, as over 500 reopened across the country.\u0026#34Is everyone relaxed\u0026#34?

There will be limitations on capacity, parking and operating hours.For now, the other areas of Walt Disney World Resort remain closed, including theme parks and Disney Resort hotels.Some Disney parks in China, including Shanghai Disneyland, reopened last week.

Well it may have got one step closer.Italy will throw open its arms to tourists from early June and scrap its 14-day quarantine period as it continues to ease one of the strictest coronavirus lockdown regimes in the world, Patrick Sawer writes.The Italian government announced on Saturday that from June 3 all visitors will be allowed in with no obligation to self-isolate. Italians will also be able to move between regions, though local authorities can limit travel if infections begin to spike.Things slowly return to normal in Milan, the epicentre of Italy\u0026#39s coronavirus outbreakWith rates of infection and deaths falling the government said that from June 3 movements to and from abroad can be limited by regional decree in relation to specific states and territories, in accordance with the principles of adequacy and proportionality to the epidemiological risk.Read the full story here.Good morning, world.  How will you have your eggs this morning?

The comments came after a CNBC report that said multiple anonymous AI researchers said they saw Musk’s views on the technology as inappropriate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAn AI executive speaking to CNBC, who asked to remain anonymous because their company may work for one of Musk’s businesses, said that “A large proportion of the community think he’s a negative distraction.”He is sensationalist, he veers wildly between openly worrying about the downside risk of the technology and then hyping the AGI (artificial general intelligence) agenda. Whilst his very real accomplishments are acknowledged, his loose remarks lead to the general public having an unrealistic understanding of the state of AI maturity.”It’s time to draw the curtain on celebrity businessmen like Musk“AGI” stands for “artificial general intelligence,” which is the hypothetical benchmark whereby a machine can learn anything that a human being could. This is distinct from \u0027standard\u0027 artificial intelligence, which is when a machine is capable of carrying out a task like a human could, such as voice recognition in Siri or Alexa.Another specialised focused on speech recognition said that Musk is “not always looked upon favourably,” while an AI researcher at a UK university said that they “instinctively fall on dislike, because he makes up such nonsense.”“But then he delivers such extraordinary things. It always leaves me wondering, does he know what he’s doing? Is all the visionary stuff just a trick to get an innovative thing to market?” they continued.On Twitter, Pesenti said that many people in the AI community would be happy to criticise Musk publicly, stating that Musk “has no idea what he is talking about when he talks about AI. There is no such thing as AGI and we are nowhere near matching human intelligence.”While Facebook team declined to give an official comment, Pesenti said that it was his “personal opinion” but that others at the company – including Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and a Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Edward Grefenstette, a Facebook AI Research Scientist – agreed.LeCun quote-tweeted Musk’s disparaging comment, saying that Tesla’s engineers still needed access to Facebook’s PyTorch to develop their products. PyTorch is a free, open source machine learning library primarily developed by Facebok’s AI Research lab.The researchers, Tesla, and SpaceX were contacted by The Independent for comment.

The BBC hosted a TV special on the night of the would-be grand final on 16 May titled Eurovision: Come Together, as part of a wider celebration taking place all this week. The Come Together show was hosted by Graham Norton it reflected on the UK’s best Eurovision moments, past and present, and was ultimately won by Eurovision stars ABBA and their performance of “Waterloo”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe BBC organised a number of shows to lift the spirits of Eurovision fans everywhere, starting with...In February, BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat began filming a documentary that follows the UK’s Eurovision entrant, James Newman, through rehearsals, as well as backstage during the live debut of his Eurovision song, “My Last Breath”.The documentary jumps to when the contest was cancelled, and interviews Newman as he reveals what the cancellation means for him. Other contestants speak about how their experiences of Eurovision differ, and what their future plans are.Eurovision 2020: The Cancelled Coronavirus Year is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer, and on the BBC Newsbeat YouTube channel.Eurovision at 60In 2015, Eurovision at 60 aired on BBC to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the song contest. It includes interviews with Graham Norton, Eurovision champion Conchita Wurst, and the late Sir Terry Wogan.Eurovision viewers moved to tears as monuments around Europe light upABBA crowned the UK’s favourite ever act at Eurovision: Come TogetherEurovision Song Contest winners ranked from worst to bestFifty years ago, an 18-year-old schoolgirl left the Bogside in Ireland and journeyed to Amsterdam to represent her country in the 15th Eurovision Song Contest. Against the odds, she won! Dana: The Original Derry Girl looks back at the life of Dana, and how she became Ireland’s first-ever Eurovision winnerGraham Norton hosted Eurovision: Come Together, a one-off TV special that gave the UK a chance to vote for their favourite Eurovision performances.The event was ultimately won by ABBA performing “Waterloo”.Right after the Come Together show you’ll get to watch Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, which will honour all of the 41 songs that would have competed in the 2020 contest in Rotterdam.This non-competitive show was broadcast across Europe, just like the usual contest, with a special hosted by the original Dutch presenters who were supposed to present the live event this year: Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley, and Jan Smit from the Netherlands. Graham Norton provided additional commentary. A virtual singalong also took place, with fans dressing up in costume and forming a huge Eurovision choir, which will perform “What’s Another Year”, Ireland’s winning song originally performed by Johnny Logan.The liveblog is now closedBBC show Come Together includes performances by Mahmood and Bucks FizzSee a ranking of every Eurovision winner ever!Vote for your favourite performanceRead about the Russell Crowe-approved Iceland representativesHere\u0027s what\u0027s been happening over the past couple of months.As an alternative to the Song Contest, our Eurovision Correspondent Rob Holley has\u0026nbspbeen running #EurovisionAgain watch-a-longs on Saturday nights, where disappointed\u0026nbspfans of the contest have been simulcasting contests from years past, with legendary ESC participants tweeting along too. Katrina (of the Waves), Alexander Rybak and Dami Im have all dipped in to the #EurovisionAgain twitter stream, providing insights into their time at the world’s biggest pop party.The EBU have enjoyed the fan-run project some much that they’ve started to source classic contests (the pre-2004 Eurovisions are usually mired in complex copyright conundrums, but the original broadcasters have been happy to help during these weird times) to debut them on the official Eurovision YouTube channel! Nearly 200,000 uses of #EurovisionAgain have made it the most popular Twitter trending topic on a Saturday night, dwarfing primetime shows like Britain’s Got Talent on the popular social media platform.Rob says: “It’s really been great for the fans. We’ve been able to e deep in to nostalgia while raising loads of money for some really brilliant charities”.As well as tweeting along, fans have raised over £14,000 for the charities Mermaids, Terrence Higgins Trust and Stonewall, often chipping in a tenner on a weekly basis in return for being entertained. On top of watching the show, Rob and friends also open the virtual phone lines and run a vote which attracts thousands of participants, and often gives a scoring outcome different to the original broadcast.“Schlager a Carola knocked Lordi off the Athens 2006 podium, which I wasn’t happy about - but Scooch did jump 14 places at our screening on Helsinki 2007, so there is an amount of justice being dished out, Rob says.\u0026nbspInstead of reporting from Rotterdam for the Independent, Rob has been publishing his interviews with 2020 participants as the podcast VISION AGAIN, for those wanting to know what the disappointed acts thought of their chances and whether they’ll be invited back.“It’s been really great and I’ve been lucky to get some of the biggest names onto the podcast. I chatted to Iceland’s Daði Freyr, favourite to win with Think About Things, who said he’d be interested to compete at 2021 should he be asked and the right song comes around, he says.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, UK act James Newman also wants a shot too –\u0026nbsphe’s busy gearing up to release his new single \u0027Enough\u0027, but Eurovision remains the goal, and getting way ahead of the game is Ireland’s Lesley Roy, who told me she’s already started plotting an absolute banger for next year. With an extra 12 months under their belts to write epic entries, expect 2021 to blast away all the disappointment of Eurovision being cancelled.”But it’s not all great news: “Other acts like The Mamas from Sweden won’t necessarily be gifted a golden ticket because the national final selection shows are too big not to go ahead., Rob explains. Sweden’s Melodifestivalen is just this huge pop behemoth, so if they want to go to Rotterdam they have to compete again.So what\u0027s actually happening at 6.25pm?Graham Norton is hosting\u0026nbspEurovision: Come Together, a one-off TV special that gives the UK a chance to vote for their favourite Eurovision performances.The choices will come from a short list of artists who will all give virtual performances on the night, and\u0026nbspthe public will be given the chance to vote for their favourites.A reminder of WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING tonight:\u0026nbspQuite a lot, actually, starting with Eurovision: Come Together at 6.25pm on BBC1. The show is a celebration of Eurovision past and present presented by Graham Norton, and will include a vote on your favourite out of a short list of contestants (also past and present).Right after that there\u0027s Europe Shine a Light, a live broadcast which the European Broadcasting Union is airing\u0026nbspin 45 countries + as an online show.There\u0027s no official competition this year, but you can bet I\u0027m going to be passing judgement on each and every one of the performances with my usual sparkling wit.Now we\u0027re seeing Dami Im and her performance of ‘Sound of Silence’, which won the jury vote for Australia in 2016...\u0026nbspbut then came fourth in the public vote and ended up second overall... Dami ultimately lost to Ukraine, who didn’t win either vote. Yes, the voting system is mad and it was a weird year.Feel free to compensate by voting for her (and that incredible dress) this year instead.The A-Z of EurovisionYes, there’s more! Rylan Clark-Neal narrated The A-Z of Eurovision at 10pm on Saturday 16 May, this time on BBC2. The special took us through all of the disasters, outlandish costumes and other memorable moments that have taken place over 65 years of Eurovision.Hosted by Steve Wright, this Eurovision-themed special was originally shown at the beginning of the 2007 edition of the competition.Catchup with all of the 2020 Eurovision broadcasts on YouTube and BBC iPlayer.

The accords are named in keeping with the Artemis programme, which is the plan to send the first woman and next man to the moon by 2024.They would include a commitment to be transparent in their work, to only explore space for “peaceful purposes”, and to guarantee they would work together to save any astronauts that came into danger during a mission.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNasa was explicit that the agreements would be made in keeping with the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which currently sets the legal framework for space exploration. That requires a set of commitments from countries which are intended to ensure that space missions are as safe and transparent as possible.But the new Artemis Accords go further than those commitments, requiring more detailed principles from the countries prepared to work with the US to head to the moon and beyond.Nasa reveals Tesla car that will drive astronauts to new launch“While Nasa is leading the Artemis programme, international partnerships will play a key role in achieving a sustainable and robust presence on the moon while preparing to conduct a historic human mission to Mars,” the agency said on its website.“With numerous countries and private sector players conducting missions and operations in cislunar space, it’s critical to establish a common set of principles to govern the civil exploration and use of outer space.”In full, the principles are that any mission should be conducted with peaceful purposes should be transparent and use technology that is interoperable and conforms to open, international standards that everyone can use. International partners also have to agree to provide emergency assistance to astronauts in trouble publicly register any space objects release the scientific data they gather protect the heritage of historic space artefacts gather resources according to international agreements not harmfully interfere with other missions and dispose of any debris or spacecraft responsibly.When drafts of the accords were leaked earlier this month, they attracted ire from Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos. He suggested on Twitter that the US was planning to invade the moon like it had Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the accords would be a way of building a coalition of other countries that would allow for it to take over the lunar surface.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Representatives also indicated that they hope for Russia to sign a version of the accords.As well as drawing criticism from Russia, the accords appear to be something of a rebuke to the Chinese space programme, which has traditionally been less transparent than the US. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine explicitly referenced the problems around its recent rocket launch as an example of where the accords could help.“The empty core stage of the Long March 5B, weighing nearly 20 tons, was in an uncontrolled free fall along a path that carried it over Los Angeles and other densely populated areas,” Mr Bridenstine told Ars Technica.“I can think of no better example of why we need the Artemis Accords. It’s vital for the US to lead and establish norms of behaviour against such irresponsible activities. Space exploration should inspire hope and wonder, not fear and danger.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just horrible to think of it in this day and age. I’ve had help from some brilliant volunteers too. I’ve got three young girls at home and I hope they’re learning something about giving back to the community from all this.“I think The Felix Project is doing fantastic work right now. Stopping food going to waste is such a brilliant thing.”Tim Young decided last month to start volunteering with Bread n Butter: a social enterprise in Barnet getting up to 600 cooked meals and food parcels out each day, thanks to around 80 crates of produce supplied weekly by The Felix Project.The 55-year-old – who is still recovering from a heart operation he had earlier this year – has been cooking up to 150 meals a week from his own kitchen.“I’m relatively lucky, I’ve got quite a big kitchen and lots of pots and pans – so I wanted to do what I could. It’s hard to see how much people are struggling at the moment, because the level of need seems to be going up and up.

I’m so glad it isn’t going to waste.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There was an 81 per cent increase in emergency food parcels given out during the last two weeks of March compared to the same period in 2019.Warning that the enormous level of need was likely to continue, she said: “If would be false of me to say we can continue to meet indefinitely an unspecified level of increased demand.”How to support our campaignThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is seeking to raise £10m for the food surplus charity The Felix Project so it can provide food for NHS staff, the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies or remain stuck at home for health reasons.The Trussell Trust chief said food aid charities had done “incredible work” since the beginning of the outbreak, and said more than 50 per cent of food banks had adapted to the lockdown by doing home deliveries.However, Ms Revie argued that unless the government strengthened the financial safety net, the UK would continue to see “the kind of destitution that drives people to food banks”.She added: “The problem is people falling into financial hardship. The answer to financial hardship is not food. We are treating one symptom of an underlying problem … The issue we must be focusing on reducing the flow of people into foodbanks.”Advocating a “cash-first approach”, Ms Revie said: “If we’re identifying families in financial hardship ⁠– the most straightforward and dignified response is to provide them with the cash.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not provide support, found out about Help The Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made In Hackney.For the past three weeks, the musician\u0026nbsphas been receiving daily meals via the organisation.

Its 48 coaches run a range of sports programmes, including basketball, tennis, table tennis, volleyball and yoga.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLuca Toth, a head coach at the charity, taught volleyball at the Central Foundation Girls’ School in Tower Hamlets. She tells The Independent: “I see sports coaching as a tool to get close to the girls and be a mentor figure. We teach them teamwork, to persevere and to handle disappointment.”Some 67 per cent of the young people Greenhouse mentors live in postcodes classed as “deprived”. Just north of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in Marylebone lies Church Street Ward, one of the most deprived wards nationally. Figures from 2017 suggest more than half of children in the area live in poverty.How to support our campaignA spokesperson for Greenhouse tells The Independent: “Lockdown came in and suddenly kids were completely cut off. One child could have had a breakfast club, a lunch club, a PE session and an afternoon sports session with us. A lot of the kids are going back to home lives that are very difficult, in confined spaces.”Some children that it mentors come from families where sport is not seen as a cultural priority. Others do not speak English at home. “The Joe Wicks PE experience might not actually cut through to them.”Joel Archard, a father of three, calls Greenhouse “a beacon of the community” over the phone with The Independent. His daughter Luna, now 12 years old, plays table tennis with Maria, another coach and mentor. “They didn’t let the lockdown stop them. They do zoom calls, and ask ‘how are you doing?’. It gives the kids a bit of structure to their lives.Greenhouse is also preparing for the end of lockdown. “Everything is pointing to the fact that the recession will hit the kind of families we deal with hardest, especially young people who have missed school,” says a spokesperson.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It now delivers close to 100 food packages a day.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project and former COO of Greenhouse Sports, says: “The Felix Project is proud to have worked closely with Greenhouse Sports for many years. During this health crisis it’s great to see them open up their amazing sports centre at the heart of the local community. We applaud their innovation.”Help The Hungry campaign to feed vulnerable Londoners raises over £4mVolunteers cook for neighbours struggling without food during crisisMarathons and piggy-back challenges help The Independent raise £3.7mTwo other organisations that have innovated to support our campaign under lockdown are Holland \u0026amp Barrett and Daylesford Organic. Holland \u0026amp Barrett, a regular supplier of The Felix Project, has donated 2,000 units of vitamin D for elderly people stuck at home at risk of deficiency.Daylesford Organic has released a range of fermented vegetables with Felix Project branding. The farm shop offers “ferments” of radish and butternut squash as “unusual” garnishes for meals or cocktails. It expects to raise an additional £10,000 per year, and all profits from the products go to the charity.Luca, the volleyball coach from Greenhouse, expresses her concern about her children’s welfare through this crisis. “There is probably no privacy for many of the kids sharing rooms. I’m worried that the ones who were ok when we left will suffer, and those who weren’t ok at the beginning will come back worse.“We are dealing with so many people who need us.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Richard Smith, supply manager of The Felix Project, said they had “really stepped up to the plate”.How to support our campaign“Some companies have hugely increased their supplies to us,” he said. “Innocent normally give us five pallets a week but this week we took 24 pallets off them. Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week. We have committed to raising £10m to ensure the food security of Londoners for three years. So well done, but the hard part comes now. ”Here, 11 of Felix’s most prolific suppliers (in addition to Ocado) explain why they have chosen to partner with Felix, London’s biggest food surplus distributor.Felix suppliers and their generous food donations in April:The firm which produces online recipe boxes has donated 39 tons. Laurent Guillemain, its CEO, said: “We are proud to partner with Felix during the most extraordinary of times. Helping to care for our communities and the vulnerable is more important than ever and we will continue to support this incredible initiative that helps redistribute surplus food however we can.”A dairy products company which contributed 17 tons. The managing director of Müller Yogurt and Desserts, Bergen Merey, said: “Over three years ago I committed to this genuine cause, having read the story of young Felix. With a 14-year-old son of my own, I felt inspired by this wonderful initiative in his memory.”The restaurant and hotel supplier gave 12 tons. Murtaza Lakhani, its owner, said: “The twin issues of food waste and hunger are having major impacts on London. We are proud to make a commitment to Felix as well as to supply high quality food stocks and fresh ingredients so that vulnerable families, elderly people and our amazing NHS workers know there is a nutritious meal waiting for them at the end of the day.”The company which produces smoothies has donated 11 tons. Its head of refreshment marketing, Suraj Gangani, said: “We’re proud to have supported Felix in getting our healthy drinks to those who’ve needed them through this tough time.”The craft organic bakery gave 10 tons. Its spokesperson said: “We decided to change the way we approached food waste and engage with just one organisation, The Felix Project. They are an inspiration. We appreciate that the work of Felix will become more critical and widespread now and for the foreseeable future.”A meat supply company that gave 9 tons. Tim Woodward, CEO, said: “We are delighted to work closely with Felix. Since we started working with them we have delivered over 32,000 meals and 6,200kg of meat for cooking.”The company behind restaurants including The Ivy, Le Caprice, Scott’s and Sexy Fish contributed 8 tons. Richard Caring, its founder, said: “During these difficult times we must come together. The fantastic volunteers from Caprice Holdings restaurants and The Ivy Collections have been cooking 20,000 meals a week to supply, in partnership with Felix, some of London’s vulnerable communities. Together we can make a difference.”An online fruit and veg box company which gave 7 tons.

There’s always, always, always in any loosening of these restrictions a risk of people catching the coronavirus.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“The key thing is that we can make these workplaces safe. You can never eliminate risk, but as we know, it is the case that it is exrtremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak and if, for any reason, there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them.”He added: “We can’t have a situation where we keep our economy, our schools and our public services continually closed down, because the health consequences of doing so would be malign as well.“None of us can guarantee that anyone will be entirely free (from risk) unless effectively they are perpetually imprisoned in their own home.”Labour is pressing the government to publish the scientific evidence underpinning the proposal to reopen schools, and to keep talking to unions, teachers and councils to ensure parents can be confident their children will be safe if they return.Shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The government have got a lot more work to do to give that confidence that it will be safe to send children back in two weeks’ time.“The government have got two weeks to get this right. They haven’t approached this in the right way so far.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailTeachers’ unions have called for more answers from the government after meetings with scientific advisers and ministers on Friday. And they have received backing for their cautious approach from the British Medical Association, while local authorities including Liverpool and Hartlepool have said they will not reopen schools on 1 June unless they are absolutely confident it is safe to do so.Asked for his advice to those opposing a return to classrooms next month, Mr Gove said: “I respectfully ask them to think again, to broaden the range of the scientific advice that they look at.“I know the BMA has the best interests of its members at heart, but actually the clear scientific and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen accompanied by social distancing.”The former education secretary added: “Children only have one chance at education. Over the past decade we have made significant strides in closing the gap between the richest and poorest in our schools. This lockdown ahs put that backwards.“If you really care about children, you will want them to be in school, you will want them to be learning, you will want them to have opportunities. Look to your responsibilities.”Ms Reeves said that parents’ and teachers’ anxieties would be “a lot less” if the government had got in place a programme for widespread coronavirus testing, followed by tracing of contacts of those infected and isolation of those who test positive.Mr Gove announced today that more than 17,000 of the government’s planned army of 18,000 contact tracers have now been recruited and said the authorities were “on course” to begin the programme by the end of this month.Ms Reeves said: “Government need to put in place some of the measures to improve confidence and that includes the test, trace and isolate strategy. The government abandoned that back in the middle of March. That was a mistake.”She added: “We want to see our children in the classroom, but to do that in a safe way two things need to happen.  First of all, the government needs to work with parents, teachers and their unions to make sure that the new plans have the confidence of everybody so that parents feel confident to send their children to school.“But also we need more transparency from government.  The prime minister said last Sunday that all the decisions that are going to be made about easing lockdown will be based on the science and here we are, a week later, and those details have not been published and that is a cause for concern and adds to the anxiety amongst teachers and teaching staff and parents about the safety.”The mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham suggested the timetable for return to school should vary according to the R value - recording the average number of people infected by each coronavirus patient - in different regions of England.The former Labour MP warned that the Prime Minister could fracture national unity unless he listens to concerns that the lifting of lockdown measures is coming too quickly for the North.Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “People do not have the R information at the moment. They can get it, but it’s not formally published by the government.“There’s a very different picture in the North, particularly in the North-East, where the R is the highest, so I can understand concerns.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The cash brings the total public and private sector funding for the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) to £207m.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“As the biggest contributor to the international coalition to find a vaccine, the UK is leading the global response,” said the business secretary. “Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions. “The new Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre and temporary facility will build ‘fill and finish’ capacity, bringing the UK vaccine programme together from discovery to

By working with partners including government, VMIC and the Vaccines Taskforce to fast-track the manufacturing capability, we are ensuring that momentum will continue all the way from lab to patient.”The government is the largest national donor to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), with a gift of £250m as part of a total £388m contribution to the global hunt for a vaccine.

The bonus was based in part on success in controlling the scheme’s finances.

Penny Gaines, chair of the Stop HS2 campaign, said: “We have said for years that HS2 was struggling to keep costs under control and the schedule was long since unachievable.  HS2 should be cancelled as soon as possible.”But the Department for Transport insisted that new governance arrangements introduced by transport secretary Grant Shapps would ensure tight control of costs.Today’s report found that both DfT and HS2 Ltd were aware of time and cost problems as early as October 2018, and the company formally notified the department the following March that it could not deliver phase one of the programme, between London and Birmingham, on schedule or within budget.But the committee said it was not until the autumn of 2019 that the transport secretary revealed that the estimated bill for the project had risen from £55.7bn to £65-£88bn in 2015 prices – the equivalent of up to £100bn now – and the first trains would be delayed by as much as seven years. Boris Johnson later gave the go-ahead for construction work on the scheme to begin in April.Ms Kelly withheld her knowledge that the programme was in serious difficulties when asked directly about the budget and delivery timeline by MPs in two appearances before the committee alongside HS2 executives in October 2018 and May 2019, the report found.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The PAC said there was “no justification” for hiding the scale of the financial crisis, and said the DfT had given “no adequate excuse” for the lack of transparency.As accounting officer for the programme, Ms Kelly conducted four assessments during 2019 on whether it remained justified in terms of the four grounds of feasibility, regularity, propriety and value for money, but did not share them with parliament as required, the report found.Her failure to provide accurate information to parliament was “potentially a breach of the civil service code and a breach of parliamentary privilege”, said the report, in a charge with DfT firmly rejects.“With so many people’s homes and livelihoods affected by the construction of the railway, there is no justification for the department and HS2 Ltd having been so opaque about the delays and budget overruns,” said the committee.“The High Speed Two programme has gone badly off course … We are unconvinced that there will not be further cost increases, such as those we have seen in Crossrail and many other programmes, especially given that the route and forecast cost of the northern sections of the proposed railway is still very uncertain and will remain so for years to come.”The report found that lack of transparency over cost had undermined public confidence in HS2, which is currently due to begin services between London and Birmingham between 2029 and 2033 and extend to Leeds and Manchester between 2036 and 2040.The forecast cost of undertakings and assurances made during the passage of HS2 legislation through parliament has “exploded” from £245m to £1.2bn, the MPs noted.PAC chair Meg Hillier said the committee was now demanding “an honest, open account and evidence of learning from past mistakes” in regular six-monthly reports from the DfT.“There is no excuse for hiding the nature and extent of the problems the project was facing from parliament and the taxpayer,” she said.“The government unfortunately has a wealth of mistakes on major transport infrastructure to learn from, but it does not give confidence that it is finally going to take those lessons when this is its approach.”The committee’s deputy chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said the report was “one of the most critical, in both the transparency of government and the handling of a project, that I have seen in my nine years in total on the committee”.Ms Kelly’s failure to inform the committee of HS2’s troubles was “a serious breach of the department’s duty to parliament and hence to the public”, he said.A DfT spokesperson said: “The current secretary of state has been clear that this project must go forward with a new approach to parliamentary reporting, with clear transparency, strengthened accountability to ministers, and tight control of costs.“This includes appointing the first dedicated HS2 minister, bi-annual updates to parliament and establishing a monthly ministerial task force, chaired by the secretary of state, to ensure the project has a rigorous scrutiny like the 2012 Olympics.”The DfT said that Ms Kelly had acknowledged in May 2019 that the project was facing cost pressures, but said that discussions to resolve them were commercially confidential.Department for Transport\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

They seem to react much better to Caravaggio than Monet. And these are Peruvian penguins, so we were speaking a bit in Spanish, and they really appreciated art history.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All you need is a TV and the inclination.But while many will have used this virtual house arrest to shake off some unhealthy old habits , the reaction to Adele’s weight loss suggests that, for some, her transformation is a betrayal of everything fat activists hold dear.Of the , largely positive comments about the star losing an incredible seven stone, some sniped that she looked “unhealthy”and questioned how she lost it — the inference being that she had succumbed to having a gastric band.But as Pete Geracimo, her former personal trainer, points out: “It was never about getting super-skinny. It was about getting her healthy.”Not least, one suspects, for the benefit of her seven-year-old son Angelo. He adds: “She embraced better eating habits and committed to her fitness and ‘is sweating!’ I could not be prouder or happier for her.”Hear hear. Yet alarmingly, research out earlier this year found that millions of women hid their efforts to slim for fear of being mocked or labelled “anti-feminist”.Saints preserve us. The truth, of course, is thatsomeone is deeply insecure about their own weight, they either pooh-pooh or, worse, lash out at the efforts of those who manage to transform their lestyle via willpower and hard slog.Far easier to do that than take a look at our own bad habits and attempt to change them. True, there are plenty of people who look overweight but are physically fit.And there are plenty of skinny malinkies who can’t run for a bus without needing oxygen. At the end of the day, being happy within yourself is not about how you look, but how you feel.Andyou feel that you are unfit thanks to lousy eating habits and lack of exercise, then you should be able to do something about it without being taken to task by those who don’t have the same self-discipline.Particularly as last week’s research from the University of Liverpool found that obesity increased the risk of dying from coronavirus by  per cent. You can’t argue with that.BOREDOM at Moore Towers has reached such a crisis point that, on Sunday, I linked my iPhone to our portable speaker, put the songs on Shuffle and said we had to endure enjoy whatever track came up.At first there were plenty of goodies from Floyd, Bowie, Prefab Sprout and Talk Talk, but then Twinkle Twinkle Little Star popped up, followed by You Spin Me Round by . . . Alvin And The Chipmunks.For the record, our youngest is now . It seems it’s not just the kitchen cupboards that need a clear-out.BRINGING million people out of lockdown was never going to be easy.But Boris’s much-trumpeted grand statement was a damp squib that’s left us as confused as Adam and Eve on Mother’s Day.In a nutshell, four-year-olds will be able go to school with lots of kids they’re not related to but not see other kids in their family, we can go to work with colleagues but not have a chat with them in their garden, we can do unlimited exercise which we could have done anyway,we go abroad we have to self-isolate for a fortnight . . . unless it’s France, and you can drive to other destinations but not too far, whatever that means.As for “stay alert”, is that the same as Police  presenter Shaw Taylor’s old mantra of: “Keep ’em peeled ”Except we could actually see someone coming at us with a crowbar.A virus that can fit squillion times on to the head of a pin might prove harder to spot.GIVEN that the use of face masks is being actively encouraged but not the professional ones needed by key workers, a number of DIY versions are being suggested.Some involve an element of seamstress skills, but for those who want a quick and effective mask they can drum up with the minimum effort, this is my favourite.Loop a child’s hair tieover each end until it resembles a boiled sweet, then fold over the ends to meet in the middle .Then simply place the wrong side against your face, loop the hair ties around your ears, and voila.You’re welcome.FASHION designer Freya Edmondson – daughter of Ab Fab star Jenner Saunders and actor Ade Edmondson – has posted this photo of herself doing a “sumptuous, heart-opening backbend”, while writing on a notepad.Freya, who teaches free online yoga courses, is just  and, therefore, wonderfully flexible.As a former enthusiastic gymnast, it reminds me of my youth, when I would watch TV while doing the box splits – with my legs stretched out at right angles to my body.With my th birthday looming this Sunday,I attempted it now it would take four paramedics and a system of pulleys to get me on my feet again.ACADEMICS may lord it over the rest of us when it comes to quadratic equations, subatomic phenomena or the three components of the epidemiological triangle, but when it comes to common sense they are often found lacking.Quite how “Professor Lockdown” Neil Ferguson thought he could preach to the rest of us about social distancing while inviting his mistress to his house is anyone’s guess, but he did, and now he’s rightly had to resign for hypocrisynothing .He says: “I accept I made an error . . . I thought I was immune.”From Covid- . . . or criticism THE latest series of Killing Eve may have had a lukewarm reception from critics, but central character Villanelle’s fashion choices have been attracting a lot of attention.One frock cost £,, another £,, and her red leather catsuit would set you back an eye-watering £,.I know these are desperate times for all businesses, but since when have fashionistas been clamouring to get their clothes on the back of a psychotic murderer It gives a whole new meaning to “dressed to kill”.HAIRDRESSERS are to stay closed until July  at the earliest.Up to now I have been making do with the occasional fringe cut using a pair of nail scissors.But given that my “style”is supposed to be choppy bob, and I now resemble Richard lll, it seems I will have to tackle the rest of it too.Worse, The Bloke will have to do the back and, God forbid, baldlygo where no man has gone before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That may still sound a lot. But it means nearly  out of every  people don’t have it.Evenyou were unlucky enough to catch it, coronavirus becomes serious overwhelmingly among the old, sick or obese, of whom the vast majority survive.Your chances of staying safe become much greater stillyou take every precaution at work: Social-distancing wherever possible, wearing PPEavailable and a mask in enclosed public spaces, washing hands regularly.The Sun is not downplaying Covid-. The UK’s , overall deaths, and the stubbornly high daily toll, tell their own story. But statistically you are still highly unlikely to get infected and ­vanishingly less likely to die.That does not give firms an excuse to swerve doing everything necessary to protect workers, allay their fears and cut them some slack. Those who fall short will deserve the flak they get.But le involves risk. Covid- has made it a fraction riskier still. We will do ourselves MORE damage long-term by refusing to venture back.Once-healthy firms are staring into the abyss. Today’s GDP figures will be dire. And while we cannot fault Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s dedication to keeping people afloat, by extending his generous furlough payments to the end of October, the sums are staggering.We shudder at the damage repaying that extra debt will do to our economic future — and at the message it sends the public about how feasible it is to pay them to stay at home. Covid may be with us for years. We simply MUST get back to work.It is a reckless fantasy to imagine a Government could keep this gargantuan bailout going until the coast is clear.THE teaching unions’ opposition to any moves to reopen schools is a disgrace.Millions are going the extra mile to get through this crisis and help others.That is exemplied by our frontline NHS and care workers. By our supermarket workers, delivery drivers and bus drivers. And it is true too of those teachers diligently preparing, setting and marking schoolwork online.This disease has very little impact on kids. They are not thought to spread it much.The Government’s top medical and scientic advisers say reopening schools would have little effect on infections. Even so, it would be done with enormous care, very slowly and not yet.But even this is branded “reckless” by the National Education Union, which has urged teachers to boycott any moves even to discuss or plan a possible .Yes, they have their members to think of.

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are . million people, give or take, working in social care and all of those people needed to be tested every week.The , tests per day that the government has announced really should be deployed on that basis only into social care.But of course you have to test the rest of the country as well so the Government needs to scale up testing dramatically.Because at the moment the testing isnt adequate and to simply do a single-point test one would have to question whether that is a benefit to us as the operator or to the government for their statistics.Covid- has had a devastating impact in care homes bringing the grim tally to ,.The Government has been criticised for being slow to address the problem as the virus ripped through care homes throughout the country.Staff and managers called for protection and testing, hitting out at the delay from ministers.And yesterday the Government published the latest R number - rate of transmission - saying it was between . and .However, the figures do have a two to three week lag, officials admitted.Its thought that the majority of transmission of cases are now in hospitals in care homes, but the rate for the community is far, far lower.The cash will help to make sure that members of staff only work in one care home at a time, and dont travel between them.It will also appoint a clinical lead in every care home, and give them access to NHS PPE training, Mr Hancock said.Care workers will get mental health support with a workforce app - designed with Hospice UK and Samaritans.The Fund, which is ring fenced for social care, will be given to local authorities to ensure care homes can stop the the spread of coronavirus.And the extra cash will pay the wages of anyone who is self-isolating. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: We’ll test every resident and every member of staff in our elderly care homes between now and early June.This £ million Infection Control Fund will help as we continue to reduce infections in care homes and save lives.From the very start of this outbreak, we have been working to protect our brilliant social care workforce and the most vulnerable in our society.Our package sets out clearly the extra steps local councils and care homes should be taking as we stamp out the spread of this virus.The latest figures show more than , care home residents in the South East and , in the North West have died involving the killer bug - making it the hardest hit regions.The North West also has one of the highest R infection rates in the country.Covid- was the leading cause of the death for male care home residents, accounting for . per cent of deaths.It was the second leading cause of death in female care home residents, after dementia and Alzheimers disease, accounting for . per cent of deaths.Those aged between  and  accounted for the highest proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in both male and female care home residents - . per cent and . per cent respectively.There has been anger among care home operators, staff and relatives the government has underestimated the severity of the impact of the disease in care.The Prime Minister has admitted he bitterly regrets the coronavirus epidemic that has spread like wild fire the countrys care homes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said scientists are looking at what youngsters will be allowed to bring into school to minimise the risk of Covid- being passed on.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson today defended plans to partially reopen primary schools from June  - admitting teachers and parents are anxious about the move.Under new guidance, children will not be allowed to bring in their own pencil cases. Schools will also have to increase measures to make sure surfaces and items which children and adults touch are clean. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here   Dr Harries told the Downing Street daily briefing: The basic public health principle is you want to keep everything as clean as possible - touch pointsyou like, so the things we normally think of as door handles and those sorts of things, wipe down and clean frequently. I think the thing in a childrenaposs environment is there are certain things that you can control pretty well, which might include pencil cases and things that you use routinely during education, and by doing that, schools can provide them and ensure that they are maintained clean.  The issue about lunch boxes is theyaposre quite personal to the child eating the lunch, and I can almost guarantee that one child wonapost want to eat the lunch of the one sitting hopefully two metres distance from them. Responding to a question from the Sunday Mirroraposs Nigel Nelson, she continued: And actually when youaposre eating youaposre also putting your hands up to your mouth and to your face so there is a dferential there around risk both on what iniduals need and what the school can supply and on managing the hygiene around it.  She added hygiene was important for both lunchboxes and pencil cases, and stressed the need to encourage children to wash their hands before and after eating. The Government expects children to be able toto nurseries and childcare settings, and for reception, year one and year six pupils to be back in school, from June  at the earliest. She said: Although it is recognised that small children will run around and interact, we expect them to, but you can still distance. I know this is the plan.  She also suggested that desks could be placed appropriate distances apart from one another to prevent long periods of close contact. Dr Harries added: A child rushing past another one in a normal area is probably not much of a risk. Butthey were sitting directly opposite to each other in a very small space, close together for a long amount of time - that might be more of a risk.  All of the interventions are designed to minimise those, while still allowing children to learn.From next month, Mr Williamson said, children will qualy for coronavirus testingthey show symptoms.A track-and-trace system will be introduced to prevent the killer bug spreading as a result of schools reopening, he told the daily Downing Street briefing this afternoon.

The Prime Minister may have survived Covid-, but the British people will not forgive him for the way the disease has engulfed the nation. In an exclusive Sunday Mirror poll today,  per cent of voters blame the Government for the highest death toll in Europe, and one in three of those cites the PM’s poor leadership. When specic health advice is called for, he rambles. When a straight answer is needed, he blusters. We get confusion when clarity is most required. Mr Johnson has shed some pounds since his illness and as PM he is now being exposed for the lightweight he is. A cheeky smile and a ready joke are no substitute for the competent leadership Britain needs at a time of peril like no other since the Second World War. The grotesque chaos in our care homes has left at least , dead. Health Secretary Matt Hancock must shoulder responsibility for the failure to test and the lack of PPE which caused that. When the care sector desperately needs money just to survive, it is not getting through. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick is responsible for that. First Secretary Dominic Raab and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps are bargain-basement barrow boys, Home Secretary Priti Patel is merely second-rate and only Rishi Sunak has emerged with any sign of sure feet.  No wonder the Chancellor is being talked up as Boris Johnson’s replacement. Because it is with the PM that the buck stops. We now know that he ordered lockdown too late, and unease is growing that he is lting it too early. Only one in five of those questioned in our poll thinks it safe for children toto school next month. And it is telling that the UK is no longer united as the devolved administrations choose to move at dferent speeds. That shows how confidence in our leader is ebbing away. We accept that dealing with a novel virus would test any government. We appreciate that Mr Johnson has probably not fully recovered from his own brush with death. But when thousands of lives depend on his decisions, what we get is not good enough. We endure minister after minister telling us at the daily No update how clever they are.

I was born with a genetic condition, retinitis pigmentosa, and, over the years, my eyesight gradually deteriorated. The best way to describe it is like looking through a straw then cling film being layered over the end. At school I couldn’t read the blackboard and I had to use a big magnying glass for books. By the time I got to university in Bath to study Chemistry it had got to the point where I couldn’t really see images at all, only the dference between light and dark. And a few years later, once I was in the first year of my PHD, I was almost % blind. When I was young I used to get very angryI encountered something I found dficult or couldn’t do because of my eyes. But over time I learned that wasn’t a helpful response. There’s no point getting wound up by the fact I can’t see, because it won’t change it. I’m an only child. My mum was a teacher and marriage guidance counsellor and my dad ran a charity, and they’ve always encouraged and supported me in everything. And technology is a blessing. For example, text to speech is kind of a saviour. For my job, I’m a principle patent engineer, looking at patent portfolios for tech companies. My computer and my phone read text out to me. And I’ve got an app on my tablet which will read out things like The New Scientist. But, of course, my great passion is climbing and there aren’t digital aids and solutions for that. I started climbing when I was young, my dad took me up my first rock route when I was two. All my early climbing was outdoor traditional climbing, and bouldering in Fontainbleau, France. My dad had been in the Mountain Rescue and was part of a mountaineering club, so we would go for weekends away climbing throughout the UK.  He taught me everything I know and I led my first route outside when I was . At this time I had about % blurry central vision and no peripheral vision. I could just about see well enough to place rock gear, but not well enough to pick out the routes from the ground. People are usually amazed when they discover that not only do I climb, but I also lead climbs. ‘Trad’ climbing is when you start at the bottom, and as you climb up, you put the bits of gear into the cracks and you loop the ropes through them as safety mechanisms, and you hope you won’t fall off! This is dferent to ‘sport’ climbing where someone has been up beforehand to drill metal bolts into the rock that you can clip the rope through, rather than having to find a crack yourself. At university I joined the Mountaineering Club and was able to climb much more frequently. We had regular trips to indoor walls and weekends away outdoors. I developed a great circle of climbing friends and went on multiple trips to Europe. On these I started Alpine climbing and ice climbing too.  But when my sight dropped to a level where I could no longer read, it started to be dficult to place gear as I couldn’t see whether it was properly seated. I also stopped being able to pick out the holds at indoor walls. There was a time when I thought I might have to give up leading as my eyesight got worse. But I never thought I would stop climbing, I just learnt to adapt with the support of my friends. People often ask me, ‘Why rock climbing, it doesn’t seem like a good activity for a blind person ’ But when I think about the danger, crossing the road is far more dangerous, and also it’s something where I’m not in control. It’s quite possible that I wouldn’t be as good a climberI weren’t blind –I didn’t have these challenges. It wouldn’t focus me. That determination is built through my disability. I met my we Molly at a climbing club during freshers’ week. Though we didn’t climb together very much because we were both very experienced so were normally partnered up with those who hadn’t done as much as we had. We were just friends at first, but eventually romance blossomed.  I actually proposed to her in  on a climbing trip to Greenland. It was my most ambitious trip yet, camping in temperatures below -°C and claiming the first ascents of two previously unclimbed mountains, which I believe is a first for a blind climber! Neither Molly nor I are jewellery people, so I didn’t have an engagement ring. Also, when you go on expeditions, all your kit is scrutinised by every member of the party, so it would probably have been found and spoiled the surprise. And I might have lost it. In the end I went down on one knee with an injured finger ring from our First Aid kit. She said yes, but then I stumbled and somehow dropped the ring. So it’s still there in Greenland! The thing that hurts most as I’ve lost my sight is not being able to see Molly’s face any more. That’s what I’m missing. There’s a photo from when we went to the Alps, of her with a pair of sunglasses on, that’s my mental image of her.  Molly was my climbing partner last year when I finally fulfilled my ambition to tackle the Old Man Of Hoy, a famous m ft sea stack in the Orkney Isles. This was the most adventurous rock route I’ve done, it was truly epic. It’s an iconic route and it’s not easy. That’s why you do it. You do it because it’s hard. You do it for the challenge, you want the satisfaction, and you don’t get that unless there’s a chance of failure. The climb itself was only half the story. It started with wild camping then an hour’s walk to the headland, followed by a tricky descent on treacherous grass slopes and then a scramble across to the base. A late start waiting for the wind to drop led to us not reaching the top until .pm. That was followed by three massive abseils back down, then repeating the tricky and slippery scramble to get back up the clf relying all the way on step-by-precarious-step instructions from Molly.  And lastly the hour-long walk back to the tents, reaching my sleeping bag at .am with the sun threatening to rise again. It was such an amazing day, unreal. When I reach the top of a climb, I don’t get to appreciate the view, but the feeling of accomplishment is incredible. There are many dferent challenges to climbing. There’s the strength element: am I physically strong enough to pull up off this small hole  And then the technique and skill elements: have I minimised the risk  If you get it wrong you can’t pull the ropes through. And, of course, there’s also the mental side where you’re constantly thinking things like, ‘It’s  metres since I placed my last piece of gear, soI fall off here I’m probably going to the hospital. Let’s try not to freak out’.

It’s been revealed that she kept a diary all the time she lived in Britain, covering everything from her engagement to Harry, the wedding and beyond. Well,any of us wondered how the Sussexes would finance their new le together “out of the limelight” in Los Angeles, we need wonder no more. A diary, even a tame one, would make a bombshell memoir and a prize beyond price for both Meghan and any publisher brave enough to bid for the rights. And we’d all be daft enough to buy it. We’re already pre-ordering the book we KNOW she’s been ­controlling. It’s called Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, and it’s due out in August. If the very title ­annoys you like it does me then you can only imagine what self-serving conceit lurks inside. How, only two years married, can they claim to understand the making of a modern Royal Family  Especially since they’ve turned their back on royalty  Meghan says she hopes it will “finally set the record straight and show the world why they were left with no other choice than to leave the royal le”. She also apparently believes “readers will finally understand the monumental anguish and turmoil she had to endure with a stf upper lip” and “see her ­vulnerable side, something the book does in great detail”.  We may be curious, even scornful, but she’ll be laughing all the way to the bank. As for the diary, we don’t knowshe’s even thinking of making it public – but what a nest egg, should she ever need it. I can’t help but wonderHarry knew his lovely bride was sitting down to chronicle her thoughts as the royals flailed around in their futile attempts to welcome her and make her happy. In my day, women were ­encouragedto build themselves a ‘F*** Off Fund’, should their relationships go bad. The idea was to keep it a secret from your ­husband or boyfriend sothings ever went south, you could flee in a ­flurry of independence and set up on your own.

The award-winning documentary-maker was given access to the top-security Porton Down laboratory where vaccines from two of our top universities are being tested. Michael told the Sunday Mirror: “Everybody is moving ahead with the belief we’ll have a vaccine by the end of the year. The speed at which it’s happening is astonishing as vaccines normally take five to  years.” Michael, , met Miles Carroll, deputy director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, at the sprawling base in Salisbury, Wilts, for a BBC Horizon special. Researchers there are looking at vaccines produced by Oxford University and Imperial College London. A million doses of Oxford’s vaccine could be ready as early as September.  Around , people will take part in its trial, half receiving the vaccine and the other half receiving a meningitis vaccine, and results are expected to begin to emerge next month.AstraZeneca, the Cambridge-based pharmaceutical group, is teaming up with Oxford University to manufacture and distribute the vaccineclinical trials are positive. Michael, who created the : diet, said: “Our own scientists are storming ahead. It’s brilliant. They got the funding and the scientists were there to rock and roll.  “The Americans and Chinese are amongst the leaders but British vaccine leaders are at the forefront. One scientist I spoke to this week was confident at least one vaccine will be available this year.” Scientists at the centre also trialled the Roche antibody tests, which they judged to be % accurate. That is now being rolled out across the country and is seen as key to getting the nation back to work. Michael said: “Porton Down is one of the few places you can test these things.  They have the live virus down there. It’s odd when you see them in their hoods and protective clothing. “The thing that’s causing all these problems is right there. They’re manipulating it and testing it right in front of you. It’s strange being so close to something which is causing distress around the planet.” Michael was last at the site in  for a BBC show. He said: “Back then they were talking about the risk of a pandemic exactly like this one. People have been worrying about it for years.”  Michael said authorities were caught out by the pandemic after previous outbreaks such as SARS and MERS were contained in Asia and the Middle East and did not affect the UK. “People got complacent,” he said. “So when Covid happened we were ill-prepared.” And he fears there are more outbreaks ahead, adding: “The rate these viruses are emerging is accelerating. There’s no doubt in my mind there are others coming down the track. Hopefully lessons have been learnt and we’ll be better prepared for next time.” But other scientists say a vaccine is unlikely to be available for general use before .  Business Secretary Alok Sharma is spending £million to speed up the building of a vaccine manufacturing centre on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire. But he will say today that although it will come on stream a year earlier than planned, it will not open until next summer. Any vaccine will take at least six months to produce after that. There are  research projects worldwide using £million of UK funding. Eight are now using people for clinical tests. But most experts predict vaccine discovery to be a year to  months away.

Currently, the NHS say a persistent cough and a fever are the two main Covid- symptons. However, people diagnosed with the virus have complained of other symptoms, with a loss of speech a possible sign of the disease. Experts at the World Health Organisationsaid dficulty speaking could be accompanied by a lack of movement, and anyone experiencing these symptoms should see a doctor. The WHO said: Most people infected with the COVID- virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Serious symptoms: Dficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, loss of speech or movement. Seek immediate medical attentionyou have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. But, a loss of speech may not necessarily always be a sign of coronavirus. Speaking dficulties could also be a sign of other medical or psychological conditions, such as hearing loss, hearing problems, certain toxins, or selective mutism. Earlier this week, a new study highlighted another, lesser-known symptom - psychosis.  Researchers at Orygen and La Trobe University in Melbourne have warned that coronavirus is causing psychotic episodes for some patients. Dr  Ellie Brown, co-lead author of the study, said: “COVID- is a very stressful experience for everyone, particularly those with complex mental health needs.“We know that psychosis, and first episodes of psychosis, are commonly triggered by substantial psychosocial stresses. In the context of COVID-, this could include stress relating to isolation and having to potentially remain within challenging family situations.” In the study, the team looked at research on viruses such as MERS as SARS, to examinethere was a connection on how these viruses might impact people with psychosis. The results suggest that some coronavirus patients may experience psychotic symptoms, such as hearing voices. Professor Richard Gray, co-lead author of the study, said: “Maintaining infection control procedures when people are psychotic is challenging. “In order for them not to become potential transmitters of the virus, clinicians and service providers may benefit from specic infection control advice to mitigate any transmission risk.” While mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety are already being focused on amid the pandemic, the researchers hope their findings will spark further research into more severe mental health conditions like psychosis. Professor Gray added: “This is a group thataposs probably going to need more support, with isolation, physical distancing, hand washing etc, and clinicians may be the ones who need to be thinking and working on this to assist this vulnerable population.

A US study claims that infected people can release thousands of droplets when speaking, which can then remain airborne for up to  minutes. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, come after scientists used laser lights to study how oral spray travels. As part of the study, a person was filmed saying the phrase stay healthy for  seconds in an enclosed space. The location was then filmed for  minutes, to analyse how many particles remained in the air. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Maryland then studied the images, which showed that loud talkers can release thousands of fluid droplets per second.This suggests that coronavirus can be spread through normal conversation, and not just coughs and sneezes.These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments, the authors said. It has long been recognised that respiratory viruses can be transmitted via droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. It is less widely known that normal speaking produces thousands of oral fluid droplets with a broad size distribution. It comes as Brits are now advised to wear face masks on public transport and in enclosed spaces such as shops to slow the spread of Covid-. Earlier this week, Transport for London urged rail and bus passengers to cover their faces as some begin ing to work as per new lockdown rules.

The thrilled player was among  people from Cwmbran in Wales who shared a £million jackpot on Peopleaposs Postcode Lottery. They were one of the six biggest winners pocketing £, but when officials broke the good news - delivered before the lockdown - they realised they had bought two tickets so were actually due a whopping £,. The remaining winners received cheques ranging from £, and £,, depending on how many tickets they play with. Local finance worker Louise Harris was among the big £, prize winners. She said: “I’m totally speechless. I never expected to win this kind of money and the champagne will definitely be popping tonight.  Since hearing my postcode area had won, I haven’t been able to stop singing the ‘someone’s knockin’ at the door’ song. I’m ecstatic.” Louise has a few ideas on how she’ll put her winnings to good use, including a few treats for her nine-year-old daughter, Daytona. She added: Daytona had her heart set on a dressing table for her bedroom. She kept saying ‘it will be a big win, mum, I’m sure’ and she was right! I’ve also always wanted to take her on a safari holiday. South Africa would be top of my list and thanks to winning, I’ll be able to make it even more memorable for us both.” Nursery teacher Joanne James, , and her husband Huw, also landed £,. She said: This is going to make a huge dference to us. Our children, Tom and Georgina, both have bad eyesight, and this means we’ll be able to get the operation that our Georgie needs. That just by playing we are helping raise money for charity is hugely important to me. I lost my mum to cancer and I suffered so badly with the loss. What charities do to support people is just incredible and so important.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here  The vast majority of the measures imposed on March  still apply, with Boris Johnson previously warning it was not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.But the overall message has switched from stay at home to stay alert - a situation that has prompted alarm and anger. Many say even the limited easing comes far too soon - with England still seeing thousands of new Covid- infections and hundreds of deaths per day. And Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all stopped short of easing the lockdown in the way Mr Johnson has. Despite the new freedoms in England, people were asked ahead of the weekend to think carefully before visiting national parks and beaches. Police forces, tourist boards and park authorities across the country urged caution. On Thursday, Cleveland Police and North Yorkshire Police issued statements alongside the North York Moors National Park Authority asking the public to avoid large gatherings.Assistant Chief Constable Mike Walker, of Cleveland Police, said: As we move into a new phase of eased restrictions and many of us are now able to spend more time outdoors, personal responsibility is now key. Please think carefully about where you are going and how you will be able to keep your distance from others.

Drinkers at the The Betsey Wynne in Swanbourne, Buckinghamshire, will enter and leave through a one-way system and be seated at tables two metres apart that are separated by Perspex screens. Customers will be urged to keep their hands clean with gel dispensers visually displayed throughout the premises and they will use disposable menus to place their order using a phone app. The pub would have a limit of  customers but the premises is spacious and also has a big beer garden. Peter Borg-Neal, CEO of Oakman Inns which owns the pub said is being used as a prototype to demonstrate how the scheme could offer pubs a leline. He told The Sun: “The country is desperate for a proper pint in the pub and we are asking the Government to treat us like grown-ups and let us open. “We strongly believe in this idea and are presenting it to the Cabinet Office via our trade body, UK Hospitality. A government adviser is reportedly supportive of the measures and brewery chiefs say it can be in place three weeks after getting the green light. The innovative plan comes hospitality bosses have warned that around , pubs may have to close their doors permanentlythey are among the last businesses to be allowed to reopen by the government. Boris Johnson previously announced the hospitality sector - including pubs and bars - must remain closed until at least July. The British Beer  Pub Associationhas warned that up  per cent of Britainaposs pubs cannot survive beyond September with the current level of financial support being offered by the Government. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA, said despite looking for a glimmer of hope, the industry now faced further weeks of uncertainty. With insufficient clarity as to when pubs will reopen, our sector remains in limbo and facing severe uncertainty and financial devastation, she said. Mr Borg-Neal echoed her claims adding that pubs need to reopen to get the economy aposgoing againapos.  He said when the lockdown was announced  barrelsfrom The Betsey had to be ed to the brewery. He added: “I can get on a Tube train with a load of strangers but I can’t go and have a pint in the pub with a mate. Where is the logic ” Government adviser Professor Robert Dingwall said: “If it is a sunny weekend and the pub has a garden and the landlords are prepared to accept responsibility for not overcrowding it, I see no particular reason why it should not reopen.” Mr Borg-Neal added: “We’d need three weeks’ notice to get in deliveries so evenwe got the all-clear on Monday we wouldn’t open until next month.

As Brits enjoy the first weekend of lockdown in which sunbathing, picnics and unlimited exercise are allowed in England, temperatures are forecast to keep climbing. The Met Office predicts today will bring dry and sunny weather to much of England and Wales, with the mercury hitting the low s. Temperatures of C will be felt widely, including in Exeter, Southampton and Norwich. Parts of the northwest are likely to see some rain and drizzle, but conditions should brighten throughout the day. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here The mercury is set to climb further still next week, reaching the mid-s in the south on Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday could even see blazing temperatures of  or  degrees But Brits keen to make the most of the glorious weather have been asked to heed social distancing advice. Anyone visiting parks, beaches or other beauty spots is urged to remember to stay m away from anyone outside of their household. Speaking at Fridayaposs Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock asked Brits to be sensible and to help avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections. Giving the latest forecast, BBC weatheraposs Ben Rich said: Temperatures are set to climb over the next few days, peaking around the middle part of the week with highs of  or  degrees. A lot of dry weather to come as well but the further north and west you are, there is the chance of seeing some rain across Scotland and Northern Ireland through Sunday morning, and the odd spot of drizzle for northern England and north Wales. That should tend to peter out and the rain further north should tend to fizzle through the middle of the day, before more wet weather s from the west later in the afternoon. The further south you are, itaposs fine with some spells of hazy sunshine temperatures up to  maybe  degrees in the south east. Those temperatures continue to climb on Monday and Tuesday getting well up in the middle s celsius in the south always some rain at times towards the north and the west. A Met Office spokesman added: As we look towards Sunday, it is going to be a cloudy and wet day across northern parts, some of the rain could be heavy at times but there should be some brightness here. The best of the sunshine though will be across much of England and Wales where there will be y sunny spells and temperatures getting into the low twenties celsius. It should feel warm in the gentle breeze although further north it is going to be quite blustery. Looking ahead towards next week, after a wet start in the north there will be a lot of fine weather for a while, however with temperatures hotting up we are likely to see things a bit more unsettled.

The -year-old was found by a patrol officer in Missouri in the middle of the night walking in traffic. His face, legs, and arms were covered with bruises, according to the officer, who said the child had a packed bag with him. The boyaposs parents, Christopher Crets, , and -year-old step-mother Nicole Crets, were arrested the next day with felony child abuse. Mr Crets was also charged with kidnapping along with four counts of unlawful possession of a firearm. Warren County Sherf Kevin Harrison said it was a aposmiracleapos the child wasnapost seriously injured.He told KSDK: It’s just a miracle that this boy wasn’t seriously injured. His eyes were swollen, his forehead was swollen, this boy was beaten and tortured at the hands of mom and dad so I’m very happy that he slipped out and I’m glad the trooper was there and that my detectives and deputies were able to be part of rescuing him from the situation.” According to the sherfaposs department, the child was taken to hospital and diagnosed with refeeding syndrome — the result of reintroducing food after malnourishment or starvation. The boy said he used to weigh between - pounds four months ago, but weighed at just  pounds at the hospital. The child is now in protective custody while his parents are in jail awaiting their next court appearance. Detectives searching the home reportedly found handcuffs attached to the boyaposs bed.

Brian Hitchens previously said he didnapost think Covid- was real, and stated that God is bigger than this virus will ever be. But just a few weeks later, Brian and his we were both hospitalised after contracting coronavirus. From his hospital bed, Brian, a rideshare driver from Florida, is now urging people to take the virus seriously. He told WPTV : I thought it was maybe the government trying something, and it was kind of like they threw it out there to kinda distract us. Brian took to Facebook in April to play down any concerns about the virus, which has so far killed almost , people in the US. “Iaposd get up in the morning and pray and trust in God for his protection, and I’d just leave it at that. There were all these masks and gloves. I thought it looks like a hysteria, one post read. However, Brian and his we are now recovering from the disease at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. I don’t want to see anyone go through what I went through, he said. My we’s on a ventilator. It’s been like that for three weeks, and it’s tough. It’s sad,” he added. The couple were still in hospital as of Wednesday, and are unable to see eachother. Brian is unsure when they will be discharged. “This wasn’t some scare tactic that anybody was using. It wasn’t some made-up thing. This was a real virus you gotta take seriously,” Brian recently said on Facebook. More than , coronavirus cases have been reported in Florida, along with , deaths. It comes as US President Donald Trump set experts a target of delivering a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year. Under Operation Warp Speed, the US government will invest in leading vaccine candidates and get ready to distribute them on a mass scale, the President announced yesterday. A crack team drawing from the government, military and pharmaceutical industry will work with other countries to find a jab that can prevent Covid-, widely seen as the only long-term way to bring the global pandemic under control. At an event in the White House Rose Garden, President Trump revealed that former GlaxoSmithKline executive Dr Moncef Slaoui and army general Gustave Perna will head up the operation. Most health experts believe it will take  to  months or more to get a vaccine ready for the public. However Dr Slaoui, who will be the teamaposs chief scientist, claims he is confident that millions of vaccines can be delivered by the end of the year. I have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine, he said. And these data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of . Trump then played down the importance of a vaccine. Vaccine or no vaccine, weaposre back, he added. Weaposve got countries that are allies ... we have some countries, frankly, that arenapost allies where weaposre working very closely together.

Most of my nerves had been strangled out of me as my tie was so tight. Any that remained were put to rest as my blushless bride drew level… and for good reason. My soon-to-be we Teresa had hardly come dressed for the occasion, opting for denim jeans, black jumper… and no veil. For while this was my first time, Teresa had been here before – many, many times. “We have come together in the presence of God to witness and bless the joining together of Luke Phillips and Savana Bishop,” incants “minister” Tom Kennedy. Turning to me, he asks: “Chris, as proxy for Luke, will you have the woman, Savana, to be your we, to live together in the covenant of marriage  “Will you love her, comfort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health and forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live ” “I will,” I proudly reply. And within no more than  seconds, the new Mrs and Mrs Phillips are pronounced husband and we. There was no kiss or even embrace. There was no time. Because we were not done yet. We had another wedding. And then, another. Because this is Montana, the only state to allow the double-proxy wedding, where the presence of neither the bride nor the groom is required. Instead, the couples simply need a pair of willing stand-ins to act on their behalf. This is where I came in. The man marrying myself and my proxy bride, who by now has been wed almost , times, was none other than her husband. Together, former LA firefighter Tom and wedding planner Teresa run a business arranging marriages for thousands of people around the world unable to attend their own ceremonies. Acting as a proxy I had joined an elite club – taking part in a style of wedding that had seen Henry IV, Charles I and Napoleon all marry using surrogate spouses. The obscure Montana law dates back to the gold rush in the s and was initially designed as a way to help out miners.  Tom explains: “Their girlfriends could be hundreds,not thousands, of miles away. It was not seen as proper to bring them to tough all-male mining communities to get married.” In those days, double-proxy marriage was legal in the Treasure State for anyone who applied, from anywhere in the world. But as lawmakers grew wise to its potential abuse the law was changed some  years ago. Now one of the two getting wed must be a resident of Montana – or on active armed services duty. The Kennedys run their Armed Forces Proxy Marriages from their home in Big Fork, and have married thousands of couples since , including dozens of UK brides.  The proxy marriage is not a lesser form of union, and comes with the same responsibilities as any other. And while Montana offers proxy marriages, proxy orces are out. Tom says: “It’s a very historic law that many are unaware of, including many government officials. When marrying in Montana you don’t need to be a minister, a magistrate or a judge to conduct the service. The only qualication you need is to be of sound mind. People can even marry each other.”While Tom and Teresa normally marry around  couples a month, the coronavirus has seen April surpass  ceremonies.Couples who would usually marry in the few days off between basic and advanced training have been unable to leave their bases. The need for them to tie the knot is not only out of love, but in some ways out of necessity. Tom explains: “As a girlfriend or boyfriend of someone in the military they hold no rights. But as a husband or we, they benefit from all that goes with being in the forces. Everything from housing and health is taken care off, but crucially it allows couples to remain together wherever they are stationed throughout the world.” The cost of their wedding, which covers all court, legal and arrangement fees, is a small price for the benefits once married. Over the years the Kennedys have seen brides and grooms aged from  to , have had “repeat customers”, and once wed a serial killer in the army, serving his time in a military prison. “That one didn’t last long,” Tom says.

China has always insisted that the outbreak began in a so-called wet market in Wuhan, where live animals were being sold. But analysis of data by an expert scientist points to the virus having been taken into the market by someone already carrying the disease, according to the Mail on Sunday. Alina Chan, a molecular biologist, and Shing Zhan, an evolutionary biologist told them: The publicly available genetic data does not point to cross-species transmission of the virus at the market. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Health authorities in Beijing believe the virus came from an animal in Huanan market, Wuhan. The market was closed by officials a day after the World Health Organisation was informed. It is believed samples from animals were taken but results have not been shared, even now. Guan Yi, a University of Hong Kong expert, said: The crime scene was completely gone. How can we solve a case without evidence   Earlier this month the World Health Organisation said the focus of the research was on transmission from animals. Donald Trump has previously claimed he had “seen evidence” that Covid- came from a lab. He declined to describe the evidence, but his remarks will ratchet up tensions with Beijing over the origins of the deadly disease.

My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.20373533-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.20373533-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.20373533-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.20373533-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united johnny russell transfer news","story":"Ex-Dundee United star Johnny Russell is open to ato Tannadice.Russell is back in training with MLS side Sporting Kansas City, with whom he has established himself as a fan-favourite.But while he is loving le in the States, Russell is not against the idea of finishing his playing career back where it started.“I had a great relationship with the fans – hopefully at some point I will maybe get the chance to get myself there,” Russell said of United to the BBC.“I wouldn’t say I have got a desire to come back – I love it where I am – but I would never turn my nose up to come back and play in Scotland.”Russell spent five successful years with Derby County after leaving United in .His subsequent move to the US, aged just , came as a shock.But his red hot MLS form has led to continued Scotland recognition – and paved the way for former United man Gary Mackay-Steven and ex-Celtic kid Lewis Morgan to join him in the States.For Russell, success in America has vindicated his leap of faith.“I said at the time that I felt it was the right decision.

If you had to have them it would be in a final, but the draw was kind to us with Raith.“They’d been doing well under John McGlynn but it gave us an opportunity to go to Hampden.“One of the things that sticks in my mind is we had the Sunday game but on Saturday, Ross County were playing Celtic.“We were going to the Westerwood Hotel in Cumbernauld to stay overnight.“We’d trained at Tannadice and headed down. I was off to Falkirk to watch them play St Mirren but Gary Kirk and Paul Hegarty went with the team on the bus.“I was listening to the radio all the way and about half-way down Ross County went one-up.“By the time I’m in the car park at Falkirk, Ross County score again with minutes to go to make it - and it really hit me then.“That was the first time I thought to myself, ‘There’s only three teams left and we’re now the favourites for the cup’.“I felt a bit of pressure going into the Raith Rovers game that we had to go out and do our business.“We were nervous but, thankfully, I had a group of players behind me who were magnicent and we beat Raith comfortably after a slow -minute start.”Although they were indeed favourites at that stage to go on and lt the cup, Houston insists that wasn’t always the case.The -year-old believes the Tangerines still had to do it the hard way in beating Partick, St Johnstone and champions Rangers after a replay to get their shot at Hampden glory.He continues: “A lot of people say Dundee United had it easy because we played Ross County in the final but they forget about the journey.“The fact is we had an away game at Partick Thistle then we were away to Premier League St Johnstone in the next round. That’s never an easy fixture.“We went down there and I remember Gary’s father had died during that week.“The players decided they wanted to wear black armbands and dedicated the win to Bobby Kirk, who was an ex-Hearts league and cup winner way back.“It was a nice gesture for the players, that’s the type of boys they were.“We went to Ibrox after that to play a strong Rangers side, who were the champions.“That was three in a row away from home in the Scottish Cup so we didn’t have an easy draw.“We were - down after Rangers got a couple of penalties, the usual at Ibrox, but to our credit we scored goals.“To see Andis Shala and Mihael Kovacevic on the scoresheet was something unusual. We got a wee break as well with wee Morgaro Gomis’ volley being deflected in.“They thought the game was won at -. They had downed tools a bit and the crowd was away to miss the traffic.“That set us up for our only home tie, the replay at Tannadice. That was a memorable game for the supporters.“The treble-buster, as he calls himself, David Robertson scored with his backside in the last minute.“That was the best thing for us because there wasn’t much time for Rangers to go and put up a comeback.“We were the better team and deserved to win.”United would see off Ross County in the final thanks to a second-half strike from David Goodwillie and a Craig Conway double.Nearly , Arabs rejoiced in watching on as Houston  Co climbed the steps to lt the Scottish Cup for the first time since .He continues: “It hits you when you’re walking out prior to kick-off and it’s just a sea of tangerine.“There were , Arabs there and that was a sight to behold. It’s so colourful.“A lot of people thought it wouldn’t be a good atmosphere because it was Dundee United and a smaller club like Ross County but to be fair to them I think Dingwall emptied for that day.“It was a busy final and the pressure was on us that we should win this cup.“There’s an added pressure there because you’re desperately keen to not mess it up for the fans.“The Saturday night and Sunday celebrations at Tannadice and City Square were amazing.“It’s something you can’t take away from that group of players and it will never leave my memory.”The celebrations would go on for days after but it is only now Houston looks back at their win as greatness achieved not bestowed.He credits predecessor Craig Levein for laying the foundations and admits there is a special sense of pride at achieving Scottish Cup glory, something the man who started it all, Jim McLean, couldn’t do.“As you get older you start asking yourself, ‘Where did those  years go to ’” he says.“It brought joy to a lot of United fans who’d only seen them win it once prior with Ivan Golac.“It felt surreal that Jim, who was the best manager of them all, hadn’t been able to get it over line with the amount of times he took United to Scottish Cup Finals.“It was great for me, personally, being the manager of United then and doing that.“The big thing for me was we had a brilliant group of players.“Craig and I had went in a few years before and he deserves credit as well. Him and I worked really hard building a new squad.“We were bottom of the league when we went in back in . Wee Eddie Thompson’s only words to Craig and I were, ‘Just keep my team in the top ision’.“We managed to finish ninth that season then fth for the next couple of years.“I was delighted that when I took over and Craig went away to be the Scotland manager we finished third, won the cup and went into Europe three years in a row.“It had been a long time for the club since it had been on that stage and they haven’t been since.“A lot of people forget that, yes we won the Scottish Cup, but we finished third behind a very strong Rangers and Celtic, and nine points ahead of Hibs.“It was a magnicent achievement and turned out a wonderful season.”Dundee United#s Scottish Cup-winning boss Peter Houston hopes Robbie Neilson can lead Terrors to Hampden triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-peter-houston-robbie-neilson embed # secretIXeWqxySKj\" data-secret\"IXeWqxySKj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/sundaypost/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/05/Home-Farm-Care-Home-300x174.jpg ","title":"revealed dario bonetti kicked rugby park","story":"The Bonetti era at Dundee didn’t throw up many dull moments – and Kilmarnock fans will certainly remember the night assistant Dario entertained them in the stands at Rugby Park.A combination of a car accident, a paperwork error and Bonetti missing a Killie goal saw Ayrshire fans that night experience both sides of the charismatic and, at times, volatile Italian.With no place on the bench for Dark Blues assistant manager, Dario watched the game from the press box behind the home supporters in the main stand.The Evening ’s former senior football writer, Tom Duthie, had a front-row seat to the spectacle.He said: “Most of the squad had travelled the night before the game, but Dario Bonetti was heading west on the Saturday.“Unfortunately an accident blocked the main road between Glasgow and Kilmarnock and along with most fans, and press, Dario did not arrive at Rugby Park in time for kick off.“When he got there he found his name had not been included on the official list of those in the Dundee technical area and, for once, the assistant manager had to head for the stand to observe the action.“Along with full-back Marcello Marrocco, who was injured, he decided to join us in the press box at the back of the main stand.“Given that the stand is for home fans, it crossed my mind this could lead to problems because I knew there was no way the passionate Italian would stay quiet. He didn#t.“But as well as kicking every ball for his team, big Dario also engaged with the punters sitting nearby and gave them what must have been one of their most entertaining match experiences ever.“Unfortunately for Dario his late arrival meant he missed an opening goal for Killie and although Dundee equalised before the break he was still unaware of it as he headed for the dressing-room at half-time.“There were some confused players in there as he blasted them and told them they were lucky to be ahead.“When he repeated that opinion on retaking his seat for the second-half I can remember a couple of awkward minutes as Marrocco, Dundee#s press officer Niall Scott and I discussed who should be the one to tell him the correct score.“I escaped that dangerous task by pointing out I was not a club employee and they were.“If memory serves me, it was Marrocco who broke the news, to be met with an eruption from his assistant gaffer.“I should add that outside of game time, Dario was as charming as his brother.“In their first season together the pair steered Dundee to a top six finish and produced a team capable of playing football that was as pleasing on the eye as anything theof the country.“As their second season progressed, however, Ivano was making increasingly frequent trips back to Italy and it was clear all was not well behind the scenes.“It came as no surprise when he was replaced by Jim Duffy in the summer of  and in just over another year the extent of the club#s spending during the Bonetti experiment became clear as it plunged into administration and was on the brink of extinction.“For all that, Dundee fans understandably remember those two years with great fondness, as do press men like myself who experienced a time the like of which is highly unlikely to be seen again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

Also, the programme is finishing later than the initial desire to do so by December .#Aberdeenshire Council have been successful in securing £.m of matched funding from the Scottish Government through the Low Carbon Infrastructure Transition Programmeto carry out a trial project at  Council homes called Smart, Solar and Storage.#The project uses PVs and battery storage combined with Smart Technology which offers energy savings to tenants and also has the potential to generate an income for the council.#For those on lower incomes, there will be a real economic challenge and the whole transition to Net Zero needs to be just and fair for all, but as yet how this will be achieved is not detailed in this interim report.#Aberdeenshire Council added that solutions for low carbon heat provision in rural and remote communities will be the biggest obstacle to delivering the targets.It added that it hopes case studies and solutions for infrastructure that will support net zero for all will be produced.The report adds: #If all sections of our population can see how this can apply to them, then the buy in to the transition will undoubtedly increase and the likely hood of success be far greater.#Councillors will be asked to approve that the report is submitted to the Scottish Government as a final response.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/Mark-Robinson-e1589205634200-127x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"online yoga sessions to be held for north east festival","story":"The annual Aberdeenshire wellbeing festival is set to feature a number of events including online yoga classes.The popular event aims to raise awareness of how iniduals, groups and communities can support mental wellbeing for all, reduce stigma and promote recovery.Featuring throughout the festival, is YogaHealth #

who came through the Pittodrie youth ranks and made more than  first team appearances between  and  # played under Dane Skovdahl, who handed him his debut, as well as Steve Paterson and, later, Jimmy Calderwood in his time at the Dons.Speaking on the Evening Express and Press and Journal#s Northern Goal podcast, in a bonus episode which will be released today, Dundee-native McNaughton revealed he was most fond of Brondby legend Skovdahl#s approach.He explained: “What suited me, especially with Ebbe, was that he was very laidback.“Over the course of my career, I found whenever I worked with anyone who was fairly chilled out and left you to your own devices, I shone.“That was the approach he had.“There were times when we came in after defeats and he’d be pretty chilled out and he’d be chatting away aswe hadn’t lost the game.“It was just his nature.”Despite only securing one top-half league finish # in   # in his time as Reds boss, McNaughton says Skovdahl and his staff taught him training methods which helped him have the career he had, which included nearly a decade at Cardf CityThe former full-back said: #He was ahead of his time in the stuff he was doing with Olympic weights and things like that.“When I went down south, I found a lot of the clubs were doing the stuff he’d been doing five or six years before.“The stuff he did at Brondby, he’d put videos up.“For the older players it was sort of dficult to accept, and they weren’t keen on it.“But being a young lad I bought into it and, over the course of my career, I done a lot of the stuff I learned under Ebbe, like going into the gym.“It was down to John Sharp as well, who worked behind the scenes and was an underrated physio in my opinion.“I would go back to him for advice.”In Skovdahl#s time at Aberdeen, there were a lot of foreign imports playing for the Dons first-team and McNaughton also spoke about about the lasting impact made on him by two of these players # Morrocan magician Hicham Zerouali, who was killed in a car crash in , and Norwegian hitman Arild Stavrum.McNaughton said: “Hicham especially, I remember he came in on trial and within about two days a few of the guys said ‘why have you got this guy on trial  You need to sign him right away!’“They’d obviously been sent videos of him which had shown him in a good light, but you knew within a training session with the lad he was a good player.“He was an instant hit because of his quality and he was also great in the changing room.“Some foreign lads find it hard. He was quiet, but had a way about, a really good character and integrated with the boys.“Him and Eoin Jess during my time in Aberdeen were at a dferent level from everybody  in terms of what they could do.“Arild was dferent in that he was just a natural goalscorer, but I don’t even think he liked football.“He actually said at one point ‘I don’t enjoy playing football, I just do it for the money’ and I was blown away.“He said ‘I think I want to write my own book or go into coaching. I think I’d prefer to do that.’McNaughton went on to explain, although Stavrum#s workrate wasn#t the highest, he was the type of talent who would #do nothing for  minutes and score two goals#.Injury and a less warm relationship with Paterson during Pele#s year-and-a-half at Pittodrie saw #Super Kev# making fewer Aberdeen starts, before his final two seasons under Calderwood, where he was once again a mainstay of the team.McNaughton revealed he thinks Calderwood#s tendency to chop and change his team and the lack of a domestic cup run were his downfall, despite top-six finishes and # after McNaughton#s departure # a fantastic run in the UEFA Cup which included meetings with Atletico Madrid, Lokomotiv Moscow, Copenhagen and Bayern Munich.In the episode of Northern Goal, which is available on your favourite podcast app, McNaughton also reveals the real story of his Dons departure, his reflections on owner Vincent Tan, FA Cup and League Cup losses in his time at Cardf City, as well as counting the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Craig Bellamy and Robbie Fowler as team-mates.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 11 coronavirus and the masters","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of other things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre.This week we discuss the effect of the Corona virus  on the tours, Steevie#s discovery of old golf clubs which he hopes might make him his fortune, Rangefinders and other golf tech and we take a quick visit to the old course in St. AndrewsAn entertaining listen which you can download for freePlay or download the episode in the link below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll rallyers in inverness action","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe opening round of the  KNC Groundworks Scottish Rally Championships took place in and around Inverness last weekend with a good entry of  cars.The event, on Saturday March , was three weeks later than usual to try and avoid the worst of the weather. There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day. Freddie Milne and Patrick Walsh in the Fiesta R were third overall.Next up is the Speyside Rally in Elgin on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre has its finger on the pulse","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Soccer Centre volunteers have received vital first aid training.Sports clubs are required to ensure a number of their volunteers have a valid first aid certicate and when Lochgilphead Soccer Centre looked to secure the services of an accredited firm to provide the required two-day course, outdoor and first aid coach Andy Craven was happy to help.Covering theory and practice of all fundamental aspects of first aid, the volunteers were grateful to Andy for his informative and interactive approach to learning important skills and knowledge to safeguard the welfare of players and spectators.Soccer Centre chairman Stuart Green  said: #It is not just about having the relevant certicate, but ensuring a good number of our volunteers have the knowledge, skills and equipment to look after our youngsters and their friends and families.#Knocks and sprains are common in football and we deal with them every week, however, even as volunteers, we have an obligation to be prepared with any eventuality and Andy was first class in guiding our volunteers through a range of scenarios.#Andy said: #Whilst first aid is a serious business, the folks at Lochgilphed Soccer Centre were a great bunch.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved.

reopening, Mr Eustice said: ldquoI think our view is that probably a McDonaldrsquos drive-thru is made for the social distancing situation we are in, in that people do not leave their car, they place

be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks, where possible.The measures will be implemented across all of the companyrsquos own-brand hotels, and will also be made ldquoavailable to joint-venture and partner hotels.Guests will face limits on their range of entertainment and activities, with football tournaments set to be banned.Only events, sports and entertainment that involve a small number of participants, and without close contact, will be made available.Other measures include online check-ins, maintaining social distancing in public areas, such as gyms and corridors, and reduced capacity in restaurants, with longer opening hours to spread guest usage.There will also be an increase in disinfectant dispensers throughout TUIrsquos hotels, and ldquoextensive new cleaning practices will be implemented for rooms.TUI said that its new  point plan is in addition to statutory regulations, which will be put in place at all of the holiday destinations where it operates.The safety measures it has set out for after lockdown form part of a wider package that includes plans in its retail outlets, as well as on flights, transfers to hotels, local excursions, and

A resilient food economy is predicated on supporting our native farmers. Yet major food retailers, companies fond of bragging about how they support British and Scottish farming, are loading their beef shelves with imported meat.Why on earth are retailers favouring Irish beef over Scotch  Itrsquos not asScottish farmers canrsquot supply enough to feed us. The answer is disconcerting. Irish beef is more profitable to stock because the Irish government is paying a Covid- subsidy to its beef industry. This allows it to dump cheap beef onto the UK and Scottish market leaving our local beef suppliers out in the cold.For supermarkets,you view it purely as an economic proposition, subsidised Irish beef is a no-brainer. They can buy it cheaper than Scotch, yet sell it for the established retail price, and be quids in. Bear in mind that our major flood retailers arenrsquot short of a bob or two at the moment.The UK Government has handed them hundreds of millions in business rate relief ndash thatrsquos our taxpayersrsquo cash ndash while they support the food chain in Poland and Ireland. And as the eating out sector has disappeared, supermarkets have benefited directly, showing their strongest sustained sales period for years.Make no mistake about it. If supermarkets get away with building their beef supply chain on imports, Scottish beef farmers might as well shut up shop now.Given the rate that state-aid subsidised meat imports are flooding into the country, we wonrsquot have a livestock industry left. So,you do buy your beef in supermarkets, herersquos my plea. If you spot Irish beef in your store, embarrass the retailer in question by putting a picture on social media, accompanied by the obvious question: lsquoHerersquos supermarket X selling imported beef instead of Scotch. Why Or make an online complaint. Even speak to the store manager, from a suitable distance away, of course. This is a really important consumer battle.If we want Scotland to keep on producing its world renowned, grass-fed beef, we must embarrass the retailers that undermine our native beef farmers while posturing about their steadfast support for them. In fact, why not dump supermarket beef shopping and start buying from an independent butcher, farm shop, or online, direct from the farmer I avoid shopping in supermarkets, but evenyoursquore a supermarket regular, yoursquoll likely accept that meat is not their strongest department. Neither the eating quality of their beef, nor their butchery, can compare with that of a skilled, specialist butcher. And they donrsquot stock a full, nose-to-tail range of cuts, preferring to sell us mountains of nondescript mince and anonymous lsquosteakrsquo and lsquostewrsquo cuts that are taste ndash and tenderness ndash challenged.Proper butchers, by contrast, can be relied on to source Scotch beef first and foremost, beef that eats well. The best amongst them usually know the farm and farmers that produced it.Stocking up family freezers before lockdown, I gave my daughter mince from my local butcher. When she got round to cooking it, she phoned me up to ask me what it was. ldquoIt smells so good, and itrsquos just so dferent from supermarket mince. The smell as you fry that up makes me feel sick.

This could have added benefits such as a drop in carbon emissions as people will spend less time on the roads.Here the government has a role by making sure connectivity is improved. Kumar is hopeful this will happen with the advent of G and believes those areas where connection is poor should be prioritised.Online business is also expected to become more relevant. Digital payments and online commerce have already increased.ldquoMore of us are ordering online and that trend will continue, he said.ldquoBusinesses will have to improve their digital footprint to manage these changes in citizen and consumer behaviour.It is not only the private sector that will have to change but also the public sector as people will expect better communication, for example.Many local authorities still use snail mail to communicate with residents even though simple messages could be sent more cheaply, quickly and safely by SMS or email.ldquoElectronic communications are better in situations like this and local authorities will have to think about how they engage with citizens as opposed to the traditional ways for simple communications, said Kumar. ldquoItrsquos about being smarter in terms of dferentiating the services for dferent citizens.Good information sharing between dferent organisations has also shown to be lacking by the crisis.ldquoWhat we need across both the private and public sector is an infrastructure that allows us to share information securely and quickly, Kumar said. ldquoIt is really necessary for the infrastructure to be improved. We can see this especially in the social care sector - how do we get real time information out on what is happening in care homes, especially for families who have loved ones there and also for the health care agencies so they can provide a better service Another problem caused by the virus is the effect on the economy and Kumar warned there would be a lot of pressure on both the private and public sector to become more cost effective.ldquoFor some time there might be pressure on doing more with less and how we do that ndash itrsquos easier to use automation and so you can focus on more complex things where you need people to get involved, he said.ldquoThe key thing for organisations is to work with their employees and think about their development. They need to make sure their journey is managed with the right skills and training to help them move in their jobs.For example, said Kumar, many organisations have been giving low quality customer experience because their employees are bogged down by mundane tasks rather than focused on customer experience.ldquoAutomation can help that,he said. ldquoOrganisations should be enabling employees who have great insight and experienceand moving them into highvalue jobs.How technology can protect employees and the economyTALK ofrobots may have many people thinking of Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator but the reality is far from terrying and more about how they can improve our lives, according to Kirsty Ramsay, vice-president of CGI UKrsquos Consulting Delivery Centre.She believes the coronavirus pandemic is making society and business stop and think about where we could have been had automation been thoroughly embraced sooner.While public and private sector businesses, have established an element of automation, Ramsay thinks this will speed up in order to make sure employers, employees and students are safe, organise themselves quickly and are able to work and study remotely -there is a second wave of the virus or something similar.As someone with a background in the public sector, she is acutely aware of how efficiency could be improved with more automation and digitalisation. This will be crucial as so much of organisationsrsquo budgets are, quite rightly, being used to support critical services, support clients and employees and introduce new services that mitigate the effects of the virus lockdown.However automation, she says, is not about job losses but about making sure that employees are focussed on the most valuable tasks, so they are not swamped with mundane jobs but can concentrate on what is really important.ldquoWe are not saying that huge swathes of people will disappear and be replaced by robots, she said.ldquoThat is not what is going to happen but some organisations may not, for example, be able to carry the same amount of vacant roles and will start to consider how employees can focus on critical tasks and process exceptions.An example of how automation can help can be seen in a robot that speeds up the process of referral of a patient to a consultant by a GP.ldquoThe number of steps this one task goes through is signicant but actually the doctor is raising a request for a patient to see a consultant, the appointment is put in his diary and a letter is sent out to the patient, said Ramsay.ldquoWe have built a robot that can carry out this repeatable task. Introducing this into the mainstream processing means time is freed up and can be used to deal with exceptions or more value added tasks.ldquoMany organisations have staff with a lot of experience and we should be thinking about how we can reduce repeatable tasks and give them time back to deal with process exceptions or value added work. It is about how we can help organisations get more from the investment made in their people."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-pretence-transparency-not-scotland-needs","story":"In recent weeks, ministers north and south have been falling over themselves to embrace their fallibility. Mistakes will be made in the handling of the coronavirus, they say. Wersquore learning on the job. But trust us, wersquore doing our best.Nicola Sturgeon, for example, told Holyrood on Wednesday: ldquoI said that I would make mistakes and that the Government would make mistakes, and I am sure that is the case.ldquoWe are dealing with an unprecedented situation.Irsquom sure she and counterparts are doing their best as they wrestle with the unknown, and footling administrative bungles are being conceded along the way.But when it comes to the big stuff that could have cost lives, itrsquos back to the usual spikey defensiveness.The UK Government missing its , tests a day target  Not a mistake, ministers cry every pm. You lot donrsquot understand success.The Scottish Government missing its , tests a day target  Not a blunder either, comes the response. Itrsquos all going pretty well, considering.Just donrsquot mention it would take almost two years to test everyone in Scotland and the UK at this rate.As for Covid scything through care homes, itrsquos nothing to do with us, Guv.Take Boris Johnsonrsquos misleading bluster when cornered by Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs this week.ldquoIt remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care homehellipwill become infected, the Labour leader quoted from the UK Government official advice in place up to March .ldquoNot true that the advice said that, replied the PM, instantly grasping the political danger of such insouciance,not grasping the facts.But it was exactly what it said.:Councils face poundm lockdown shortfallThe guidance is there on the UK Government website under a warning that it was withdrawn on March .Thatrsquos more transparency than you get with the Scottish Governmentrsquos website, where withdrawn guidance has been vigorously deleted.Like the official advice to care homes published on March  which gives a chilling clue as to why almost half the Covid- deaths in Scotland have occurred under care home roofs.ldquoIt is not advised that residents [with Covid] in long term care are admitted to hospital for ongoing management but are managed within their current setting, it told staff.In other words, Scots homes were discouraged from sending Covid patients to a hospital, despite the fuller range of care on offer and the higher grade PPE there, plus the risk of sick residents acting as sources of infection to others in the home.The latest version of this guidance, published yesterday, says a transfer to a hospital ldquoshould take place after a clinical assessment that is in the best interest of the resident, in keeping with their choices, and where the care required cannot be done in the home.The March  document also says new residents arriving from hospital ldquodo not routinely need confirmation of a negative Covid test. Now two negative results are mandatory.You wonrsquot find it easy to compare one version with the other, however, because the first has been all but scrubbed from the internet. It lingers on in a handful of web caches.But asked on Wednesdayshe thought early mistakes led to excess deaths and testing in homes had been a failure, Ms Sturgeon was emphatic. ldquoNo, I do not, she told MSPs.She then said the high mortality rate was ldquonot caused by our handling the virus in care homes as other countries are it is intrinsic to the dficult nature of the virus. Intrinsic to the virus. Oh well then. Thatrsquos that.The Scottish Government was also apparently blameless in its handling of our first big Covid outbreak, when  people, eight from Scotland, caught it at a Nike conference in Edinburghrsquos Hilton Carlton in late February.Ministers knew about it by March , when cases started appearing, but still let Scotland play France at Murrayfield five days later, and didnrsquot ban large gathering until March .They said nothing about the Nike incident for two months, until a BBC documentary revealed it last week.:Letters: We are being held back by the timidity of the Scottish GovernmentMs Sturgeon denies a cover-up, saying the first case was mentioned at the time in a press release. However, that merely referred to an infected person in Scotland who ldquohad contact with a known positive case, without saying they caught it in Scotland, far less a major outbreak in Edinburgh.The First Minister says she accepted advice that patient confidentiality could have been compromisedshersquod said more, but that was looking at the issue the wrong way around.ldquoThe thing that wasnrsquot said was that there were a number of cases associated with one event, she said. Well quite. Thatrsquos the problem.Ms Sturgeon also says everyone who needed to be contact-traced was contact-traced. But that assumes a perfect system in which everyone remembered exactly who they met for  minutes or more over  hours. Publicising the outbreak would have helped identy people who would otherwise have been missed.Quizzed by the media on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon insisted she was satisfied at the time, and remains satisfied, that ldquoall appropriate steps were taken.However her knowledge of what happened at the time seems hazy.ldquoIrsquom not even sure I knew what the venue was until it was reported in this programme, she blurted out.Itrsquos hard to see how she could be happy all steps were taken without knowing basics like that. The venue was not some isolated country retreat. It was a very large hotel on one of the busiest streets in Scotlandrsquos capital, a few yards from the Royal Mile. That information was surely relevant, and her lack of curiosity looks culpable.This retreat from candour is especially worrying as we pivot to the next phase of the crisis, and the ginger easing of the lockdown. Ms Sturgeon must give an update by May .When Mr Johnson replaced Stay at Home with Stay Alert in England, the First Minister and others complained it was vague and imprecise advice.It was, next to Stay at Home. That was as definitive as it gets. The next phase will be vague and imprecise.Even the Scottish Governmentrsquos latest framework paper on easing the lockdown says people will need to ldquoremain vigilant for symptoms of Covid in others, aka stay alert.Asked for her superior alternative slogan last week, Ms Sturgeon tellingly failed to offer one.The months ahead will be messy. As people go out more, the virus will go with them. The R number will flutter disconcertingly. Politicians will make more mistakes. The stressed-out ones in office will doubtless seethe about mouthy idlers in opposition.But truth and transparency will serve everyone better than carping and sour denials.

Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees Mogg declared this week that the off-the-cuff remarks, the flow of interventions and the ldquobobbing of members waiting to be heard was much missed. Asthe theatre of politics was what makes good laws and holds the powerful to account.The New Zealand Parliament has long had a % rule in place, where the whips of one party can cast % of their partyrsquos vote as long as % of its members are present.

MSPs could spend more time in their constituencies at key moments when a campaign or issue demands their attention is not in Edinburgh. It also might just make elected office more attractive to under-represented groups, particularly those with caring responsibilitiesThe criticism of this system is that it puts too much power in the hands of the whips. But that ignores the untrammelled power they have already, often exercised on a whim and informed by baggage and trades.Keeping MSPs two metres apart at the moment brings the capacity of the chamber down to  MSPs.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-normal-people-dog-owners-football-helicopter-head","story":"Billy Connolly had an observation about the Wee Frees wanting to ban sex while standing because it might lead to dancing.

Humans need art and culture to make sense of pain and suffering.Coronavirus will inevitably prompt a wave of great art ndash movies, novels, music and theatre ndash which will interpret and explain what it was like to be a human when the world closed down and sickness was everywhere.In fact, wersquore already seeing culture respond to the virus. One of the artistic highlights of the last few weeks has been a series of short TV dramas called Isolation Stories ndash subtle, sad, funny takes on le during the pandemic.OriginsWe see humanity struggling to deal with catastrophe and crisis in our earliest cultural offerings: our origin stories.Whatrsquos the story of Noah but a Bronze Age disaster movie  Nearly all cultures have a flood myth. The Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh recounts a flood legend, as do Norse, Celtic, Native American and Aboriginal Australian myths.The flood is a universal story of destruction and survival. Itrsquos thought most flood myths have some root in reality. Perhaps a memory of the Ice Age. The biblical flood was possibly inspired by the ldquoMinoan Eruption of BC when a volcano devastated what is now the island of Santorini. It was one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history, triggering tsunamis which would have caused death on an unimaginable scale. The Minoan Eruption might also be the basis for the Atlantis myth.Some of our greatest ancient literature is about mass death and ruination ndash from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the Viking Ragnaroumlk, to Homerrsquos Iliad and Virgilrsquos Aeneid, both recounting the fall of Troy.Living with the permanence of disaster and devastation laid the ground for a cultural obsession with death which shaped our global religions. End Times lies at the heart of Christianity ndash the final book of the Bible, Revelation, is also known as The Apocalypse, after all.The dance of deathNothing left such a lasting scar on human culture, though, as the pandemics of the second millennium: the Black Death of the s, the plagues of the mid-s, the cholera outbreaks of the Victorian age. For hundreds of years, until the coming of modern medicine, death by infection was commonplace. Disease, fear and grief fed into culture in extraordinary ways.One of the greatest works of literature is The Decameron by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio ndash an immediate and lasting response to the Black Death, which ravaged Europe, killing half the population between -. The Decameron tells of a group of aristocrats who retire to a country house to wait out the plague. While in self-imposed quarantine they tell stories to pass the time. If therersquos one moral to the tales itrsquos this: Death doesnrsquot care who you are, itrsquos just a matter of luck and timing when the Grim Reaper comes knocking.Without The Decameron it is unlikely we would have Geoffrey Chaucerrsquos The Canterbury Tales ndash the foundation text of English literature published around . One of its most famous stories is The Pardonerrsquos Tale, directly influenced by the Black Death. In the story, a group of men set out to kill Death ndash who, wersquore told, took their friend and a thousand others ndash but instead, they end up killing each other. Nobody beats death.But it was through painting that the pain and suffering of the middle ages found the most powerful expression. Memento Mori paintingswere everywhere the skull appearing in artwork after artwork, often alongside the hourglass showing the sands of time trickling away.One look at The Triumph Of Death by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted around , and you will immediately understand how omnipresent mortality and disaster were for our medieval ancestors.It is a carnival of death on canvas. The painting is of a wasteland ndash Bruegel almost invents the idea of the post-apocalyptic. Everywhere skeletons are killing, capturing, torturing and humiliating men and women, from kings to beggars. Itrsquos truly nightmarish ndash and remains terrying.The painting foreshadows the horrors of the th century. One could easily imagine SS guards as the murderous skeletons. In fact, nowhere is Bruegel more echoed than in the  artwork Hell by the Chapman Brothers, featuring miniature models of Nazis engaged in appalling violence.Paintings of the Dance Of Death, or Danse Macabre, became ubiquitous from the s as Europe rebuilt after plague. In Danse Macabre art, Death leads people of all social classes to their graves. Le is fleeting, the allegory says, and what you have on Earth ndash wealth, power, beauty ndash is meaningless.The Danse Macabre persisted as a cultural mot well into the modern period. Most people will associate it today with the music of Camille Saint-Saeumlns, and the theme tune to the TV show Jonathan Creek. With its scratchy, spooky violins and spidery, disorientating cadences, part of the Danse Macabre is even known as ldquodiabolus in musica ndash the Devil in music.Pain on the pageWhen the novel began making a mark on culture in the s, Daniel Defoe ndash a master opportunist ndash was quick to jump onboard and use the memories of his own brush with End Times as a child to artistic advantage.Defoe lived through the  plague which ravaged London. Three years after his success with Robinson Crusoe, Defoe wrote A Journal Of The Plague Year. Itrsquos a fictional account of one man surviving amid the ruins of London, but historians, critics and scientists tend to agree that Defoe was pretty accurate in his rendering of real events.Reading the Journal today is like seeing a mirror held up to coronavirus. The same fears, scandals, emotions and acts of kindness affected people then, as they affect us now. The rich thrive, the poor die therersquos isolation, quarantine and social distancing nurses do the heavy lting therersquos panic buying conspiracy theories science and government struggle to cope. Whatrsquos changed Early Romantic writers grappled with death on a daily basis ndash death in childbirth, infant mortality, outbreaks of cholera and typhoid. To many people,you say ldquoRomanticism theyrsquoll think of John Keats expiring of TB aged just  in . Romanticism and death go hand in hand.Edgar Allan Poe was the dark dandy of the Romantic movement. His story The Masque Of The Red Death both harks back to medieval horrors, and looks forward to the lurid post-apocalyptic sensibilities of the th century. Itrsquos a perfect bridge in the art of the apocalypse.The story tells of a prince who hides out in his castle and parties while the plague rages outside. Itrsquos a clear lt from Boccaccio. At midnight, Death arrives in a blood-splattered robe. The masque ends with a castle full of corpses. Death, here, is like a slasher from a modern horror movie.The Romantics also saw the apocalyptic possibilities of science. Electricity was cutting edge in the late s. It was the erarsquos equivalent to articial intelligence and robots . The cause ceacutelegravebre of the time was experiments with electricity on dead frogs which made their legs kick. Such tinkering with nature had a profound impact on the young Mary Shelley.Her novel, Frankenstein, is the response of a terried society to the suffering science could unleash on humanityunrestrained. The book also marks a turning point in apocalyptic art as plague takes a back seat to manmade threats. Both Frankenstein and The Masque Of The Red Death would become central parts of the horror movie canon in the th century ndash an art-form influenced by two world wars, the Holocaust, and the looming threat of global destruction posed by the Cold War.Nuclear nightmaresThe new science that frightened Mary Shelley was a terrying fact of le come the Victorian era. HG Wells was waiting in the wings to become the purveyor extraordinaire of tales of mechanised apocalypse. His The War Of The Worlds tells of Earthrsquos near destruction at the hands of alien invaders. No longer did disease dominate our fears of destruction, but technology.The mechanised mass death of the First World War saw fears of the apocalypse seep into the deepest recesses of culture ndash most notably in the outpouring of war poetry by soldiers like Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. However, modernism itself was shaped by the trenches. The epitome of modernist poetry, TS Eliotrsquos The Waste Land, is a fractured meditation on death and decline. It ripples with apocalyptic imagery and sentiment, such as the line: ldquoI will show you fear in a handful of dust.German art in the aftermath of the First World War was soaked in death and destruction. Painters like Max Beckmann and Otto Dix, veterans of the trenches, depicted a world of skulls and cruelty, crippled soldiers and deformity. European towns were at this time full of mutilated men, some with their faces hidden behind masks so bad were their wounds. German expressionist cinema became a laboratory for dealing with fear and suffering in films like Nosferatu and The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari.From the , films, TV and books were all exploring themes of the apocalypse, often in the same way ndash via science fiction. Memories of genocide, wartime super-weapons like the V rocket, and the arrival of the Cold War with its threat of total destruction loomed large in our cultural consciousness.Cold War fears played out in three ways: via the metaphor of alien invasion in movies like The Day The Earth Stood Still and Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers. In monster movies like Them! and Godzillashowing the dangers of nuclear radiation. Through gritty realism in films like Threads or Nevil Shutersquos novel On The Beach, about a group of Australians waiting for atomic fallout to hit Melbourne.Fear humansSomething started to change in the late s, though. In apocalyptic art, the threat of global destruction now started coming from us, ordinary people, not just impersonal war or disease. As we entered the mass media age and live footage of murder, assassination and terror entered every home with a TV, culture picked up on the fact that other people were just as scary as bombs and germs. What greater symbol of humanityrsquos gt for self-destruction than the ruined Statue of Liberty lying half consumed by sand at the end of Planet Of The Apes  Mad Max took this ldquofear humans trope to its commercial peak.The zombie film came into being in  with George A Romerorsquos Night Of The Living Dead ndash since then wersquove been deluged with a genre which is about two things: the end of the world and how itrsquos other people we need to fear. Ironically, the zombie genre has eaten itself alive with an endless parade of films and TV shows from The Walking Dead to World War Z, and Train To Busan to Stake Land. Its ubiquity has drained its power. A better exploration of the danger posed by other people is found in the  British TV series Survivors.Literature is now in hock to the post-apocalyptic too. Young adult fiction is dominated by death and disaster with franchises like The Maze Runner and The Hunger Games. Our greatest writers seem compelled to meditate on the end of the world in works like Cormac McCarthyrsquos The Road and Jose Saramagorsquos Blindness.Before the rise of the superhero movie genre , blockbusters over the last few decades were dominated by the end of the world. Think of Armageddon, Deep Impact, The Day After Tomorrow, the Terminator series ndash with their very modern fears of asteroids, climate change, AI and robotics.Even comedy now embraces the apocalyptic with Shaun Of The Dead, This Is The End, and the TV series Last Man On Earth. Documentaries look increasingly at our penchant for self-destruction in programmes such as An Inconvenient Truth or Le After People. Computer games explore apocalypse and pandemic in titles like The Last Of Us.You may not think it, but modern music ndash from punk to pop ndash is also filled with End Times imagery. REMrsquos Itrsquos The End Of The World As We Know It Nenarsquos Cold War anthem  Red Balloons Einstein A Go-Go by Landscape OMDrsquos Enola Gay about the flight crew which dropped the A-bomb on Japan Eighth Day, Hazel OrsquoConnorrsquos rf on the rise of the robots New Orleans Is Sinking by The Tragically Hip, foretelling Hurricane Katrina. The list goes on. Even the most popular, ephemeral and upbeat form of culture is dominated by death and destruction.What it all proves is that wersquove been dreaming this dream of mass crisis and global panic for a very long time. Now we just happen to be living it. But as everyone from Boccaccio to Otto Dix shows us, we can get through it, we will survive. And once we do get through it, therersquoll be a rebirth, a genuine renaissance of art and literature, to explain these strange and sinister times wersquore experiencing."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-first-steps-get-started-injury-free-running-programme","story":"Sue Gyford of JogScotland says the organisation is delighted that so many people are taking advantage of the opportunity to do daily exercise, but stresses the importance of starting gradually.She said: \"Itrsquos important to do it in a way that avoids injury, sopeople are taking up running, wersquod encourage them to follow a programme that helps them do it gradually and safely.

Grief can be lonely, so try to maintain connection with people.Sleep when you can, evenonly for a few hours at a time. It is well known that grief frequently disturbs normal sleeping patterns, and can bring unusual or disturbing dreams, and the lack of sleep can be exhausting. If this persists, speak with your doctor.Avoid tasks that require concentration, when our concentration is not as sharp as usual, thoughts of what has happened can flood our minds, making tasks such as driving dangerous.If you canrsquot face eating, just try small snacks little and often and remember to drink not to become dehydrated. Alcohol is best avoided.Talk about how you are feeling. Grief can be overwhelming, it is common to question the meaning of our own lives following a death, and thoughts of suicide are not unusual either.Dont expect too much of yourself.

This includes the establishment of a joint ministerial committee to discuss the ongoing pandemic and its management.A statement, released this afternoon, Thursday, on behalf of Alistair Carmichael MP and Lord Jim Wallace of Tankerness said: “Across the country, people are worried about their loved ones and their jobs in light of coronavirus – and they are getting mixed messages from governments.”In a time of crisis, confusion and inconsistency breed fear and put people at risk. A collective approach could help to restore public confidence that our leaders are pulling together.This is not about dropping blame at anyone’s door. The reality however is that in recent days and weeks, attempts to formulate responses to the coronavirus are more notable for apparent disagreements between national governments than for policy substance. We need governments to build consensus and create a shared responsibility across the UK.”We are calling for a more joined up response to what is a cross-governmental challenge – by establishing a coronavirus Joint Ministerial Committee “A coronavirus JMC with an enhanced remit, meeting regularly and with an approach based on consensus and shared responsibility would help to reduce disputes, with all governments involved in developing plans.”It would help to refocus coronavirus response based on national and regional needs rather than political borders. This solution could help reduce the chaos of the current political climate – and point the way towards a better long-term crisis response mechanism in future.”We believe that an enhanced JMC for the coronavirus crisis is the right way to give people confidence in their governments during this time – with a message that leaders are working with, rather than against each other.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The UK is currently the co-chair of the Equal Rights Coalition. We have a duty to uphold universal human rights.“Earlier this year I welcomed the legalisation of same sex marriage in Northern Ireland. I am proud that the Liberal Democrats have led the way in supporting equal rights.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He said: “We are very disappointed that we have been unable to carry out a public event in Hoy.#The previous event that we held in Hoy, and indeed public events we have held where in Orkney during the project, have been very beneficial in meeting with the public to talk about Orkney’s Community Wind Farm Project.“The emergency legislation passed by the Scottish Government is vital in keeping projects on track to support our future economic and societal recovery, businesses and jobs and avoiding delays to infrastructure and other developments.“It’s really important to us that members of the public are offered the best opportunity possible under the current circumstances to make their views known about the plans so that we can consider this before we submit our application.#We have worked hard to develop a consultation plan which gives as much flexibility as possible to allow folk to provide that input and are hopeful for a high level of participation.”The council intends to submit a planning application later this year.The project is part of a project which also includes proposed wind farm developments at Quanterness and on Faray in the North Isles.The development will consist of up to six turbines with a maximum blade-tip height of .m, access tracks, crane hardstandings, turbine foundations, underground cabling, on-site substation and maintenance building, a temporary construction compound, potential excavations borrow workings and a permanent meteorological mast.The objective of the PAC is for communities to be better informed about major and national development proposals and to have an opportunity to contribute their views before a formal planning application is submitted to the planning authority.It should be noted that comments made to OIC through this PAC process are not representations to the planning authority. If a planning application is subsequently submitted, neighbour notication and publicity will be undertaken, and iniduals and communities will have an opportunity to make representations on that application to the planning authority at that time.To discuss options for speaking to the project team please contact Kirsty Groundwater, Project Officer, Orkney Islands Council by email on kirsty.groundwater@orkney.gov.uk or by phone on . The deadline for submitting comments to the project team is Monday, June , at pm.Comments can be submitted through:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

To get ahead of them, you need to be quick off the mark.This weekend will see theof their soccer leagues behind closed doors, marking a conclusion to the sporting lock-down due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.With nine games to go, a win for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday would see them cut the margin at the top to a single point by the time leaders Bayern Munich kick off in Berlin on Sunday afternoon.The decision comes after the government gave the green light to games going ahead in mid-May and approximately , tests were carried out on the players, coaches and support staff from all  clubs in the top two leagues at the end of April.The German league website reported a second wave of testing, around the , mark, has flagged up two positive cases which will be monitored.The countrys leader Chancellor Angela Merkel is highly-qualied and holds a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry. She is happy the country has achieved the goal of slowing down the spread of the virus.She handed the responsibility to the organisers of the league and they have put a special sports medicine and match operations task force in place to managed the move back to competitive sport.Tier two club Dynamo Dresden has since put their squad and management team in isoaltion for two weeks after two players tested positive for coronavirus. The rest of the leagues will go ahead.If only we had locked down as quickly in this part of the world. Thank God for local communities and for the GAA, who acted swty to lead people once Leo Varadkar signalled the need to act in early May.The Taoiseach was naiumlve during his appearance on the Late, Late Show to hint at the chance for the All-Ireland championships to be played this year.It is dficult to see how, but the GAA leadership has since issued the statement confirming that there will be no inter-county action until October and club activities wont begin before mid-July,they even do.It leaves uncertainty surrounding the chance of playing games behind closed doors, which is not ruled out, but anyto action – club or county – is subject to public health guidance. googletag.cmd.push SAFETY FIRST When I think back to club month in April last year, there is nothing I would like better than ato action. Laveys clash with Swatragh ending in a draw, Foreglen and Claudy going down to the last seconds and Banaghers clash with Dungiven decided by a point. It would make you jealous thinking about it.Everybody knows how tight the calendar is and that there will only be room for county or club,there is a . But not both.With all players essentially club players and the chosen few on county , it is only fair the GAA cater for everyone and scrap the county scene. It may seem like the nuclear option and an extreme one, but the hierarchy would get huge respect for making such a dficult decision. This reinforces how well clubs rallied around those in need. It was the GAA at its very best.I would feel for Derry hurlers though, who were in a terric situation to eventually get out of Division B. So maybe the GAA could finish out the few games involving the relegation and promotion, so that it is an even keel when  comes around the corner.Deep down and with a realistic hat on, I cant see much being played. The safety of a nation is just far too important. We are not Germany. They got off to a better start, with stronger leadership coming from the top.I just hope the GAA dont force teams to play behind closed doors. It is not an option. There is some dference between Bayern Munichs Robert Lewandowski and say... Derrys Karl McKaigue.Big Lewandowski, now that all the players are tested, can be kept in exile from his family. Professionals can stay in hotels and there is money there to fund that.McKaigue is a physiotherapist and potentially working on the front line. How can he possibly stay in isolation. Are the GPA going to be able to pay himhe stays at home  I wouldnt think so and Derry will not be able to pay him to stay in separate accommodation between games.As regards testing. A GAA player could be tested on a Monday to seehe is able to train and pick up the virus after that. His test could come back clear and he could infect the rest of the  and the opposition come the following Sunday.It just isnt feasible. If it is not safe for supporters to attend games, then players are the same.Watching the Bundesliga this weekend should be a reminder to decision makers of how a country can benefit from acting early and in a calculated manner.Us sporting addicts, we will just have to keep watching it on television.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

It was announced yesterday that fishing will be allowed as part of the easing of the lockdown restrictions. Glenowen Fisheries, which is based within Creggan Country Park, will be among the local facilities to re-open next. A spokesperson for the fisheries stressed that people would need to pre-book and pre-pay before arriving at the facility. Fisheries Minister Edwin Poots has confirmed that the Public Angling Estatewill gradually re-open to local anglers from Monday. Thirty PAE’s across Northern Ireland will re-open to the public for recreational use, but anglers should only use the DAERA facilities within their local area and should not travel long distances. Minister Poots also confirmed that car parking facilities will remain closed until  May . googletag.cmd.push Speaking about the announcement, the Minister said:“In the interests of public health, I shut down the angling estate on  March, to discourage unnecessary journeys and protect my staff as well as anglers themselves, given that the majority are in the + age bracket and many have concessionary angling licences due to underlying health issues. “While car parks will remain closed until  May to discourage long journeys, I have decided to permit local anglers back on to the Public Angling Estate so that they can participate in their favourite recreational activity. “By its nature, angling is a solo sport or hobby, and its participants can enjoy a day’s fishing without being in close contact with others. The sport has huge benefits for people’s mental and physical well-being and in this time of uncertainty, I know that many people have missed the solitude and peace that angling and being outdoors with nature, brings them. googletag.cmd.push “However, let me be clear – anglers must continue to follow social distancing guidelines, practice good hand hygiene and walk to their nearest PAE, fishing alone or with a member of their own household. I do not want to see crowds of people near the river banks and fisheries.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

Second was Ballymoney farrier John Mawhinneyrsquos Motalee, ridden by Denis Macauley who in later years bred Brave Inca. Strahane Last took third ahead of False Modesy, ridden by Ballygowanrsquos I Kerr for Tom Kerr.This was double success for Lisburn vet-surgeon Robert Steele, as he had earlier won the second race of the day, the R E Hamilton Hunter Chase Championship Qualier, value pound, on Eurowin. Second was Meadow Hawk, ridden by William Gault, from Randalstown, with Downpatrickrsquos painter Kieran McLoughin third on the Leo McGrady-owned Le Bambino.Irsquom not sure where I watched all the races, but I do recall that I went to the second fence on the course to watch the final race, the Ashley Bar Mares Maiden Race. In those days the fence was an open ditch and permanent.The leader going into the fence was Miss Alex, trained by Victor Robinson at Portadown and ridden by Tom Howley. The six year old never lted, firing her rider onto the ground, and in the process brought down Colin McBratney on More Cloud. Somehow the other  runners avoided Howley as the race progressed.The eventual winner was Bonnetys Bridge, a rare ride and a sole career win for Don Ferris from Poyntzpass, Newry, who is now the father-in-law of top local amateur Mark OrsquoHare. Second past the post was Dalaray, owned by Banbridge farmer Robert Mulligan and the mount of Ian Buchanan, who was a dentist in those days. Third was Staboe Lady, ridden by her owner, M CampbellThe meeting was run under the stewardship of Craig Caven and Mrs Doreen Johnston. The hon secretary was Ballydrainrsquos Jim Pooler, while his son, Chris, was the announcer. The clerks of the course were Denis Macauley and Tom Edgar and among the honorary surgeons was Mr Alan Archbold from Seaforde. In those days Billy Cromie from Clough was well known as the board marker.Among the advertisers were Charles Keown, Renault dealer Royal Ascot Roadhouse, Carryduff Seaforde Transport CJ Foy MPS, Irish Street, Downpatrick The Old Tom Bar, Castlewellan Watt and McBriar Ltd, Saintfield Abbey Grill, Downpatrick and Irwinrsquos Superfoods, Ballynahinch.Following on from the only career wins of Lavery and Ferris, it is interesting to record that in  Craig Caven, Ardglass farmer and long time master of the East Downs, was able to achieve a long held ambition to ride in a point-to-point when partnering Nightmasterrsquo, a course specialist owned and trained by John Macauley, in the opening Alan Dunlop Confined Hunt Race.It was a very wet and windy day mdash only eight of the  entries took part mdash but Craig won from ldquoTullumgrange, bred and owned by Ardglass farmer Dick McConvey, and ridden by Darragh Cross rider Paul McMahon. Red Gazette, owned by Frances Haw from Ballynahinch, came third.Felix Burns, who is now over , from Rossglass, had a runner in the race called Bright Spree VI. It is also interesting that More Cloud, ridden by Colin McBratney, won the concluding race, the Joseph Walls Mares Maiden Race, from Comber owner Elizabeth OrsquoPreyrsquos Yankee Lass and No Time for Tears, in the colours of Drumaness owner Phil Kimber, this one ridden by Tom Howley,Other runners in the race were Eddie Armstrongrsquos Barcora Maidrsquo, ridden by Yvonne Armstrong, both from Saintfield, Craig Queen, owned by Tom Stronge from Killinchy, and Turkish River VI, owned by Strangfordrsquos Dickie Murphy, the mount of Paddy Fitzsimons.Liam Lennon broke a bone in his foot when colliding with a rail on Sam Hamiltonrsquos OrsquoBriens Daughter and had to be helped of his mount.It was sad to learn that former Downpatrick flat jockey, Michael Mathers, has passed away recently..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Gondola.jpg","title":"Newcastle gondola tourism project edges closer  ","story":"PLANS for a poundm investment in a flagship tourism project in Newcastle have received formalsupport from the Northern Ireland Executive.Over poundm of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration and tourism projects across Northern Ireland has been made available by the Stormont administration to match-fund a number of so-called City Deals.The City Deals are designed to provide local authorities with packages of funding and decision making powers to boost their respective economies through large development projects.Newry, Mourne and Down Council, which is part of the Belfast Region City Deal, is spearheading the Mournes Gateway project with the series of ambitious plans including a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains.The ambitious proposal mdash designed to revolutionise tourist facilities in the resort and signicantly increase visitor numbers mdash also includes an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy.Other aspects of the scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a lsquogreen travel networkrsquo which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.Confirmation of the NI Executiversquos funding for a series of schemes across the Province was confirmed last week, with the poundm Stormont investment package viewed as a crucial component in helping rebuild the economy post-coronavirus.The ious proposals which form the core of the Mournes Gateway project have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service, Environment Agency and other key agencies, with confirmation of NI Executive funding welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He said it is very signicant that the Executive has weighed in with its support for the Newcastle project as part of the Belfast Region City Deal.He described the government support as an ldquoimportant milestone on the road to delivering the flagship tourism proposal which, he said, has the potential to firmly cement Newcastlersquos place as a key visitor destination.But Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project is not just about visitors, explaining it is also about catering for the needs of local people, with the NI Executive funding representing another critical piece in the development proposal jigsaw.ldquoIt is my understanding that the projectrsquos business case has been submitted, he said.ldquoWhat we are talking about is ensuring that we deliver a sustainable tourism venture, one that will also focus on the arearsquos pre-Christian and Christian heritage and also Newcastlersquos industrial heritage.ldquoIt is important to look at the overall picture of what is envisaged. There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them. It is also vital that was is created is used all-year-round, not just during the traditional tourism season. The focus is also in on making the most of the natural environment that we have in Newcastle and the surrounding area.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said that the Belfast Region City Deal represents a major investment.He said in the Newry, Mourne and Down area, the investment proposals focus on the Mournes Gateway project and several schemes in the Newry area, including a city centre regeneration project, new theatre and conference facility and southern relief road.ldquoFunding is also being made available for digital infrastructure enhancements and enhanced skills and employability provision across the region, said the spokesman.He said the vision from the City Deal investment was to deliver inclusive growth, deliver up to , more jobs and increase the value of goods and services produced in the area by poundm annually..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Going.jpg","title":"Newcastle man’s extraordinary job post at the South Pole  ","story":"IMAGINE looking out of your kitchen window and seeing a humpback whale idly swimming by, or a small team of seals at play in the water.Therersquos snow and ice everywhere, animals outnumber humans, noise is completely muted but yet you have never felt more alive or connected to the world.Thatrsquos the extraordinary experience Newcastle man Kit Adams enjoyed when he took up a job offer which saw him as postmaster at the Port Lockroy research station on Goudier Island.Itrsquos located off the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, more commonly known as the South Pole, and is one of the most remote places in the world.The  year-old mountaineer lived and worked with a small team of people over four months in what has become an important heritage site and a tourist destination for people who want to see the thriving penguin community.Employed by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, Kit handled the postcards sent by hundreds of holidaymakers on Antarctic cruises who visit the island and claim to have set foot on earthrsquos most southerly point.Back at his familyrsquos home in Newcastle, Kit has had time to reflect on what the experience meant to him.ldquoThe one thing that became clear to me is that itrsquos the type of environment that I want to spend more time in, said Kit, who coped with freezing temperatures of up to minus seven degrees fahrenheit.ldquoIt really affirmed what I thought I wanted to do, and thatrsquos spending more time in the polar regions. Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

However, over the past few weeks clarityhas been provided by Ministers through a set of guidelines which it is suggested, should be address prior to any formal decision to reopen being made.As such council officers have proposed an initialoperating model to see the borough’s four main sitesreopen.The report states that services at these premises would be availableto the general public on weekdays from am to pm.A Saturday morning slot would,these recommendation are approved by Council, be available only for health care and associated workers.It is also suggested that initiallywaste is limited to black bag and potentially green waste and that only cars are to be permitted.The need to limit the reopening to the four main recycling initially, is, the report claims, “based on a mix of waste product capacity and maximising the use of key staff ”.The report concludes by stating that the implementation of this model is dependant on Council’s abilityto redeploy staff and on the speed at which waste operators could get their service operational, ensuring that the vehicles are road worthy.Given these considerations the report suggests it may take up to five working days from a decision being made to the actual reopening of the four sites.This issue is due to be debated at tonight’s virtual council meeting.The meeting is set to get underway at .pm and members of the public can watch the debate by clicking hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The borough’s five other sitesare to reopen at an unspecied later date.Addressing this plan, the Director acknowledgedthat the Executive’s announcementhad changed the nature of the debate.“There was an announcement this afternoon [Thursday] from the Executive that said travelling to recycling centres is, from Monday, an appropriate reason for travel,” said Mr Parkinson.“With that in mind, what I would suggest to members is that we progress with the proposed model initially. However in the following days, we work to open the other five sites shortly afterwards.”Addressing the issue SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon asked that this matter be dealt with under scheme of delegation in order to ensure that recycling centres can be opened promptly.He also asked that Council’s bulky waste collection service be “restarted in tandem” with the reopening of recycling centres and queriedhow recycling centres could cater for those who are shielding.His comments were address by Council’s ChiefExecutive, Roger Wilson, who said party group leaders had made their “desire to get centres open as quickly as possible” clear.He also said it would be a “matter of practicality”the decision were to remain under delegationas this would “remove the element of having to go through a call in period”.Council’s Strategic Director, Mark Parkinson, said he would agree with Councillor O’Hanlon “on the point about bulky waste collection restarting at the same time” as recycling centres reopen.Ulster Unionist Party councillor, Julie Flaherty, commendedthe “fantastic job” waste men and women are doing across the borough and said her party would support steps to reopen these centres quickly and safely.The Alliance Party’s Cllr Eoin Tennyson asked about PPE for staff and was informed by Mr Parkinson that the council has a sufficient supply of PPE.The Director also informed Cllr Tennyson that Council is meeting with unions “every morning” to make sure “the equipment is reaching the right people” and the supply of this equipment is “reviewed on a regular basis”.Councillor Darryn Causby welcomed the fact Council can now “get these centres open” and asked what type of material would be accepted at that start.He was informed by Mr Parkinson that in line with the initialproposal the sites will accept “black bags and general waste until processors are back up and running” and that “over a period of time, we will expand the waste cycle”.Independent Councillor Paul Berry called for a “common sense approach” to allowing certain trailers access to recycling centres.“Some areas across this borough, do not have a brown bin for their garden waste and I think their needs to be a common sense approach towards letting some trailers with garden waste have access to these sites,” said Cllr Berry.Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell, agreed with this point. However, the Council’s Strategic Director explained that restricting sites to cars and black bags only is an attempt to deal with an expected initialpeak in demand.“We will get a vast number of people looking to bring black bags and access the centres,” said Mr Parkinson. “We are limiting it to cars initiallyto manage capacity. Once we are over that peak, and we expect that to be within a few days, we can look at allowing access to trailers and white vans.“In regards to smaller sites, the other thing to consider is their size,we get the demand we expect, we will be forced to close them again very very quickly as they will be at capacity.”DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said he was concernedthatsmaller sites were not opened quickly, residents in those areas could feel “short changed”.His party colleague Alderman Gareth Wilson, said this issue was one the general public are “engaged with” and are aware that it is a service that can be offeredwith “social distancing kept in place”.He also said Council needs to be very careful about getting the message across about what type of material can be accepted at these centres.This view was agreed with by DUP Alderman Paul Rankin who said thatany announcementwas to be made, Council would need to “give a timeframe or specydetails on when the other five sites are going to open”.SDLP Councillor Thomas Larkham enquired about the openingtimes for the four main centres and was told they would open from Monday – Friday am to pm, initially, in line with the report presented to members.It was also made clear, following a query from SDLP Councillor Eamon McNeil, that a special time slot for NHS and other care staff would be in operation on Saturday mornings from am to  noon.DUP Councillor Margaret Tinsley then asked that Saturday opening hours be extended to allow all those back at work to access to the sites.An announcementon the issue is expected from Council tonight , following a party group leaders’ meeting where the issues raised during the debate will be discussed.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "}]
