The published figures reveal very little about this.’The note admits ‘the published figures have NOT revealed the scale of the intervention on 16 September’. She fears that informed commentators may ‘suggest that the total underlying fall we have published since September is well short of the full effect and to speculate that part of the effect has been concealed’.‘The latter would, of course, be correct’, she admits bluntly.

Boys tend to be lighter at that age as they often haven’t started puberty, unlike most girls.The figures were compiled by Public Health England, who said they were ‘extremely worrying’ and very difficult to reverse. Researchers have previously warned that severe obesity is as bad for someone’s health as a lifetime of smoking.A severely obese adult dies ten years earlier than someone of a normal weight and is much more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.Previous figures have shown that a fifth of children who leave primary school are obese, and a third are either overweight or obese.Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ‘The rise in severe obesity and widening health inequalities highlight why bold measures are needed to tackle this threat to our children’s health. These trends are extremely worrying and have been decades in the making – reversing them will not happen overnight.’Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ‘Although shocking, this new data is not surprising.‘For many years we have been calling for bold action and it appears for these young children, it did not come soon enough.’Professor Jonathan Valabhji, National Clinical Director for Obesity and Diabetes at NHS England, said: ‘The country’s growing obesity epidemic poses problems for the NHS but is also extremely worrying for the nation’s overall health as obesity in childhood paves the way to obesity in adulthood.’Last month the Government published an updated obesity strategy, which ordered all restaurants to reveal their calorie counts on their menus.They are also consulting on banning discount deals on snacks and ‘guilt lanes’ at supermarket checkouts, lined with sweets and chocolate.But critics described the strategy as ‘namby-pamby’ and accused ministers of caving in to the food industry.They have asked firms to meet voluntary targets on sugar, fat and calorie reduction but evidence in May suggested these were having little impact.Severe obesity is defined by a child’s body mass index, or BMI, the relationship between their weight and their height. Children are classed as being severely obese if their BMI is in the highest 0.4 per cent for their age.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/20/20/001C322300000258-0-image-a-116_1532113585364.jpg","title":"Full fibre broadband coming UK 2023 Quick speeds available 4 country","story":"It will take until 2033 for super-fast ‘full-fibre’ broadband to be available across Britain.

For example, with Bonnard’s The Studio with Mimosa 1939-46, being loaned by the Centre Pompidou in Paris, it often takes some time for observers to notice the figure in the left-hand corner.Frances Morris, the director of Tate Modern, also plans to introduce bigger labels for the show so people will not have to crane in to see the title and lender.“It is the biggest complaint we have from members of the public, that they cannot read the labels,” she said. “It disrupts the looking. To show Bonnard in this closely attentive way will be a revelation.”There will be about 100 works in the exhibition that will focus on his intense colours, which, the show will argue, transformed painting in the first half of the 20th century.Curators said the show would trace four decades of the artist’s work, from the emergence of his distinctive style in 1912 to his death in 1947, and it would highlight less well-known aspects of his career.For instance, two rarely seen works showing Bonnard’s response to life during the first world war will go on display together in the UK for the first time since they were painted. A Village in Ruins near Ham (1917) shows desolation and misery while The Fourteenth of July (1918) shows national celebration.Gale said Bonnard was a “notoriously shy” man who was widely perceived as a solitary figure. “One of our aspirations of our project is to somewhat insert him back into history, to see how he responded to the circumstances around him.” Musuems and private collections around the world will loan important Bonnard works such as Dining Room in the Country (1913), coming from the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and The Violet Fence (1923), from the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh.After Tate Modern the exhibition will travel to Copenhagen and Vienna.• Pierre Bonnard: The Colour of Memory will be at Tate Modern from 23 January until 6 May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a73c08faa0c35546fbb97228e07f92196e51c61/647_367_4219_2531/master/4219.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eb5221bb05caca6e74d6133c20d64c6","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Emmanuel Macron and Pussy Riot at the World Cup final, Trump and Putin in Helsinki and the wonders of the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b42ced869000ef2da19139d291010a463855b83a/0_720_2525_1514/master/2525.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2ca76b9ff36398b04cf9053bc69de8f","title":"john russell an australian impressionist in france in pictures","story":"Sydney-born impressionist John Russell spent 40 years in Europe, where he cultivated friendships with late 19th-century and early 20th centuries luminaries Claude Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri Matisse, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Vincent van Gogh.

An irate orange figure with a bristling moustache, the Lorax is an environmental activist who wastes no time in berating the axe-wielding Once-ler, a shady money-grabbing interloper who lays waste to the environment to produce peculiar knitted outfits called thneeds.Now researchers say the book may have been inspired by the things Seuss saw on a trip to Kenya, and that the bristly character may have been based on the orange moustachioed patas monkeys indigenous to the area.Donald Pease, a Seuss expert and professor of English and comparative literature at Dartmouth College who is a co-author of the research, sees a parallel between the relationship of the patas monkey to its habitat and that of the Lorax to his truffula trees.“The patas monkey is in a commensalist relationship with the whistling thorn acacia trees,” said Pease. “That means that it depends upon the acacia tree as its primary source of nutriment but it doesn’t threaten the survivability of the acacia trees.” The authors suggest the Lorax might have been similarly dependent on the truffulas, meaning his future and that of the trees are tightly linked, rather than the Lorax simply being an outraged eco-policeman.“No one is claiming that the patas monkeys and the whistling thorn acacia trees are the actual referents for the truffula trees and the Lorax the claim is they are plausible inspirations for that remarkable invention,” said Pease.Writing in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, the authors note how a trip to Mount Kenya Safari Park seemed pivotal to breaking Seuss’s – real name Theodor Geisel – writer’s block as he worked on his book.There are also physical resemblances, the authors say. Geisel changed the Lorax from blue to bright orange, while spiky plants left in the wake of the Once-ler’s thneed enterprise seem rather familiar.“When fully tufted, the truffula tree looks nothing like a whistling thorn acacia,” said Pease’s co-author, Nathaniel Dominey, an expert in primate evolution. “But there is one depiction of the tree without its tuft, and that does very much look like a whistling thorn acacia.” The team report how they made a composite image of the Lorax’s features from 13 images of his face, and used a machine-learning system computer analysis to reveal that the Lorax is much more similar to patas monkeys than is another orange character from a different Seuss book.And there is more. “Even the voice of the Lorax (a ‘sawdusty sneeze’) resembles the ‘whoo-wherr’ vocalisation of patas monkeys,” the authors write.But Charles Cohen, a Seuss expert, said he was not convinced by the alleged physical resemblances made by the authors. Pease stressed that not all of Seuss’s creations were drawn from nature. “Many of them are completely fanciful, I think – he loved to invent,” he said. “I find it very difficult to imagine a creature in the Arctic or Antarctic that would resemble the Grinch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33ecc11ff2df5e9eb71fbf2411f555da9871bf8/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9b2c6896e171ef09515a70b5ab458ab","title":"man booker prize 2018 longlist nick drnaso sabrina ondaatje graphic novel","story":"Nick Drnaso’s Sabrina, which explores the disappearance of a young woman, ‘does just what good fiction should do’ – and will compete with Michael Ondaatje’s WarlightAlso in the running for the UK’s most prestigious literary award is a thriller from the crime writer Belinda Bauer. Snap opens with a mother abandoning her three children in a broken-down car and plays out as they struggle to deal with her disappearance. The judges called it an “acute, stylish, intelligent novel about how we survive trauma”, which “undermines the tropes of its own genre and leaves us with something that lingers”.“I’d read it even before I knew I would be a Booker judge and it seemed to me to be an outstanding novel,” said McDermid. “My fellow judges read it and one said, ‘This transcends genre’, and someone else said, ‘This shows what genre can do at its best’ ... It is an extremely clever piece of storytelling with characters you care about, and that’s what we were looking for – something well written that engages with mind and heart.”A longlist that stands out for its “willingness to take risks with form”, according to chair of judges Kwame Anthony Appiah, also features debuts from Sophie Mackintosh and Guy Gunaratne. Mackintosh’s The Water Cure “unpicks patriarchy at its core”, according to the panel, while Gunaratne’s In Our Mad and Furious City is “an inner city novel for our times”. The poet Robin Robertson mixes verse and prose in his first novel, The Long Take, while Daisy Johnson’s first novel, Everything Under, is enough to put the 27-year-old alongside Sally Rooney, picked for Normal People, as the youngest authors on this year’s list. Johnson and Rooney are “looking at the world from the perspective of their age and their books have a very different flavour”, McDermid explained, “but they’re there because they impressed us”.Only one former winner made this year’s Booker longlist: Michael Ondaatje, for Warlight, which opens in 1945 with London still reeling from the blitz. The other major name in the running for the Booker is the Pulitzer-winning novelist Richard Powers, selected for his novel The Overstory. With US writers having won the last two Man Booker prizes after the award was opened up to authors from outside the UK and Commonwealth – a decision that Julian Barnes described as “daft” earlier this month – naysayers will be celebrating the fact that just three US writers were longlisted this year: Powers, Drnaso and Rachel Kushner, chosen for The Mars Room. Called “terrifyingly authentic” by judges, The Mars Room follows the story of a woman beginning two consecutive life sentences, plus six years, at Stanville Women’s Correctional Facility.The  first book award-winner Donal Ryan makes this list with his story of a Syrian refugee, a care worker and a crooked accountant, From a Low and Quiet Sea. Esi Edugyan’s Washington Black, the story of a slave who becomes the personal servant to an eccentric scientist, and Anna Burns’ Milkman, a look at Ireland during the Troubles through the perspective of a young girl, complete a 13-strong longlist assembled from 171 submissions – the highest number of books ever entered for the prize.“We tried to read blind as much as we could,” said McDermid. “We didn’t care where the writers came from or whether it was their first book or their 40th. I read most on my iPad so I really was reading blind, with no author bio or publisher information.”Appiah said that he and his fellow judges had been struck by the way the novels on the longlist “disrupted the way we thought about things we knew about, and made us think about things we didn’t know about”.“Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the times,” he said, “there were many dystopian fictions on our bookshelf – and many novels we found inspirational as well as disturbing. Some of those we have chosen for this longlist feel urgent and topical others might have been admired and enjoyed in any year. All of these books – which take in slavery, ecology, missing persons, inner-city violence, young love, prisons, trauma, race – capture something about a world on the brink.” Appiah is joined on the panel by McDermid, the critic Leo Robson, the feminist academic Jacqueline Rose and the artist and graphic novelist Leanne Shapton. The shortlist for the Booker will be announced on 20 September, and the winner on 16 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/352e98e27193894358c017dbcbf2beecd661044c/14_149_3486_2091/master/3486.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e48009cfe224b82a079213646aaf8fd4","title":"ministers set to be given new powers to block foreign takeovers","story":"Proposals cover all sectors of the British economy on national security groundsMinisters will have the power to block foreign takeovers across all sectors of the British economy on national security grounds under new government proposals designed to protect some of the UK’s most important and technically advanced businesses.The business secretary, Greg Clark, wants to widen the scope of the current system, which is limited to large transactions and certain industries such as defence, to cover all UK firms including small businesses as he seeks to keep vital firms and technologies  out of foreign ownership.The proposals, which will be subject to a 10-week consultation, will allow ministers to halt or unwind takeovers and even the smallest asset sales that could be deemed to jeopardise Britain’s national security.Potential targets under the new rules are likely to be Chinese and Russian takeovers of defence-related industries. Technology firms, including cybersecurity businesses that already have links with the Ministry of Defence, or are viewed as crucial to the development of the UK’s financial and commercial defence systems, are also expected to top the list of ministers’ national security concerns.Clark allowed the £74m takeover of the handset maker Sepura by the Hytera Corporation of China last year, making it only the second review of a transaction on national security grounds in 18 months, after the MoD raised concerns this month over the sale of Northern Aerospace to a Chinese buyer. The Competition and Markets Authority later cleared the Northern Aerospace transaction, by which time it had lapsed. Under the proposals, buyers and sellers will be under no obligation to notify civil servants of a purchase, but face five years in jail if they are found guilty of infringing the new regime.The Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp Industrial Strategy (BEIS) expects civil servants to consider 200 cases a year under the new rules, leading to 100 formal reviews of which 50 will result in remedies, which could range from deals being blocked to ministers imposing conditions on a sale.Some lawyers have argued that the proposals would result in a radical change in the UK investment landscape and could subject a broad range of transactions to potentially costly and lengthy reviews. The white paper, which follows similar moves by France, Germany, the US and Australia to give ministers greater powers, will require civil servants to review each case within 15 days of notification.Under the current rules stemming from the 2002 Enterprise Act, ministers can only intervene in mergers worth more than £70m and only on limited grounds. New rules will cut the minimum threshold to £1m on all deals. Certain industries will be cited as the most likely to targeted, but all business transactions will potentially fall under the new system.Ministers are understood to believe that the race to secure the latest defence-related technologies will lead to a spate of takeovers and asset sales by foreign firms.The industry minister Richard Harrington said last month: “These new rules ensure mergers and takeovers in key areas of the economy cannot risk our national security, while maintaining the openness to trade and investment that is underpinned by our modern industrial strategy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0352bbd2bbf7492e1078a54b5a1e9896dcd0ac01/0_0_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce81fee6182a0d33f11aacae8c8be121","title":"darwin comes to town how cities are creating new species","story":"From the nut-cracking crows of Sendai to ‘Turdus urbanicus’ (the new urban blackbird), animals are changing their behaviour and evolution in cities – and in dramatic and surprising waysOn the eve of the Euro 2016 final between France and Portugal, ground staff at the gigantic Stade de France in Paris had left the stadium’s lights on, for security reasons. Attracted by the blinding floodlights, thousands upon thousands of migrating Silver Y moths descended into the empty arena. Those not killed by the heat of the lamps eventually ended up among the grass of the playing surface, where, after the lights were turned off, they hid throughout the day of the big match.As evening fell, 80,000 spectators took their seats and the lights were turned back on. The sleeping moths stirred, and soon thousands were zigzagging among the players. Photographs taken that night show annoyed football officials picking moths off each other’s suits, while the swarm blocked the lenses of TV cameras and hung from the goalposts. Perhaps the highlight came when Cristiano Ronaldo sat injured and weeping on the pitch, while a lone Silver Y sipped his teardrops away.As the Portuguese superstar had discovered, the mingling of urban development with the natural world can throw up some weird and wonderful occurrences. Cities are like mad scientists, creating their own crazy ecological concoctions by throwing all kinds of native and foreign elements into the urban melting pot, then spicing it up with artificial light, pollution, impervious surfaces and a host of other challenges. Researchers around the globe are documenting how globalisation and urbanisation are changing the behaviour and evolution of animals.Indeed, evolutionary biologists no longer need to travel to remote places like the Galápagos to discover their holy grail: speciation, the formation of new and distinct species in the course of evolution. The process is going on right in the very cities where they live and work. In tune with their human population, cities have been assembled from immigrants from around the globe. Either intentionally or accidentally, people have been ferrying flora and fauna across the world for as long as they have been trading and travelling. The ubiquitous Javan myna birds of Singapore first arrived as pets from Indonesia around 1925, sought after at the time as virtuoso impersonators. They now rival the human population in terms of numbers (and noise). The bright-green ring-necked parakeet, originally hailing from India and Africa, has established itself in European cities thanks to the caged-bird trade for much of the 20th century. In London, they feast on seeds of horse chestnut trees brought from Greece.Releasing 40 parakeets in 1974 “because Brussels could use some more colour”, the owner of a Belgian zoo singlehandedly founded the country’s entire population, now numbering some 30,000 birds. At the end of the 19th century, drug manufacturer Eugene Schieffelin decided to bring to the US every bird ever mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. In 1890 and 1891, he shipped 80 breeding pairs of European starlings (Henry IV Part 1) from England and released them in New York’s Central Park. Today, there are about as many starlings as there are people in North America.Our gardens, balconies and parks are stocked with plants from all over the world, which then provide food for a motley crew of animals from all continents. In Malaysian cities, European rock pigeons are ripping out the flower buds of Chinese hibiscus bushes planted along the pavements. In Perth, the Indian northern palm squirrel was released in 1898 and since then has maintained a healthy population thanks to the abundant fruits of African date palms and other exotic palm trees in the city. The urban loom weaves food webs from weft and warp that are thrown together by chance, linking species in new and exciting patterns.Places where human activity reaches fever pitch abound with exotic species. These urban ecosystems are formed not by ages of evolution or the slow colonisation by species under their own steam and of their own choice, but by human diligence alone. And that human urbanisation has had a sometimes surprising impact on the behaviour of animals.In the Japanese city of Sendai, the local carrion crows famously discovered how to use passing traffic as a nutcracker, dropping nuts among the wheels of slow-driving cars and picking up the flesh after the car had passed. For nearly a century in the UK, the milk bottle top-opening skills of tits – lively songbirds with a handsome pattern of yellow, black, and blue and olive-green – have been astounding and annoying city dwellers. Indeed, when manufacturers eventually introduced metal caps, the birds simply learned to hammer a hole in and then pull away the foil in strips.In Vienna, spiders have been observed to ignore their natural preference for the dark in favour of weaving their webs on sections of a bridge lit with fluorescent tubes. The spiders in the artificially lit “habitat” caught up to four times more prey in their webs than the ones that stayed in the dark. And when ornithologists in Mexico discovered an abundance of cigarette butts in the nests of house sparrows and finches, they were unsure why. Was it simply because the butts made the nests more comfy, or could the birds have noticed that nicotine – an anti-insect agent – could help to keep mites, fleas and lice at bay?The impact of cities is not just evident in the behaviour of animals – urbanisation has also changed the course of animal evolution.The shape of a bird’s wing is not something that evolution can mess with with impunity. It is very closely wedded to a bird’s way of life. Long pointed wings are better for fast flying in a straight line, while short rounded wings are good for making rapid turns or for quickly taking off.The conclusion was inescapable: only cliff swallows with wings short enough to take off vertically from the tarmac to escape an oncoming car had managed to get away and spread their short-wing genes in the gene pool. The tardier long-winged ones ended up as ex-swallows on the hard shoulder, their long-wing genes excluded from the pool. And, as the surviving swallows became ever better adapted at evading approaching vehicles, the number of casualties plummeted.It is precisely this quick-response benefit of more rounded wings that may be one of the reasons that the settler starlings evolved. In those 120 years since Schieffelin had released the starlings’ founding fathers in Central Park, the human population in western North America (the part of the continent that the starling expanded into) grew almost fifty-fold. What had been tiny settlements when the starling arrived blossomed into metropolises in a matter of decades. And with urbanisation came new dangers for urban birds: cats and cars. It is quite likely that this is what caused the American starlings to evolve a wing shape that helped them get out of the way of a pouncing cat or a speeding motorcar hurtling towards them.Cities have even begun to form new species, and for evidence we need look no further than Turdus merula, the blackbird – one of the world’s oldest and best studied urban animals.First, blackbirds began wintering in the city. Then, sometimes only many decades later, a few winter visitors stuck around for spring and eventually took up breeding with one another, gave up migration altogether and turned into resident city-birds, abandoning the forest.That’s about as much as one can glean from field guides and birders’ reports. To really get a feel for what makes the new urban blackbird different from its ancestral forest blackbird, we have to look at the work that an entire cottage industry of urban blackbird researchers has been doing over the past 20 years. In almost every European country, a team of biologists has stepped up and jointly built a veritable urban evolution fest around this one bird species. All this research seems to point in one direction: that the urban blackbird is evolving into a separate species, a case of true speciation.Across Europe and North Africa, city blackbirds have been found to have shorter, stubbier bills than forest blackbirds, presumably thanks to the easy pickings at bird feeders and other places in the cities where food can be had without pecking, probing or pincering. Whether it’s due to those different beaks is not sure yet, but urban blackbirds sound different too. The urban background noise forces the blackbird songsters to change their pitch and timing. As researchers in the Netherlands found out after recording almost 3,000 songs, urban blackbird concerts are performed at a higher pitch than forest ones, while a German research team discovered that, as foretold by Paul McCartney, urban blackbirds are singing in the dead of night. In the city centre of Leipzig, they start a full three hours before sunrise, well before the trams and cars start creating a racket. Forest blackbirds open their beaks only at dawn. They also start breeding earlier in the year than their sylvan relatives, as their biological clocks are advanced by more than a month.A second reason that the city blackbirds breed earlier is that they don’t migrate. They spend the winter in the city, leisurely picking food off feeding tables, and can start breeding when they feel like it. The forest blackbirds on the other hand are, by and large, migratory: to escape the cold and the scarcity of food, they spend the winter in the south and only when they return to their home ground can they begin breeding. By that time, the blackbirds in the city are already smugly ensconced in their nests.It is important to know that many of the differences were revealed in the laboratory, with forest and city blackbirds that had been reared as chicks under the exact same circumstances. So, they differ by nature (that is, genetically), rather than having learnt different modes of life. One could argue that over the past centuries, Turdus merula has spawned a new species, Turdus urbanicus, if you will. It’s not quite there yet, but it’s a matter of time for the process to be completed. The chances are that Turdus urbanicus will be the first in an ever-growing compendium of new species to have evolved in that new, expanding environment: the city. As things stand, cities are still a new phenomenon on Earth, and most urban animals and plants have only begun adapting to them for the past few centuries, millennia at the most. But if we can sustain our urbanised existence into the distant future (a big if), future generations might see the evolution of a unique and truly urban ecosystem.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2899ed4e0053a0a4e655dfcbb97c683d002f182f/0_0_5514_3308/master/5514.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94cb2d0d53dc1066f1353095824571fd","title":"48 hours in denver how to spend a weekend in the mile high city","story":"From biking, hiking and high-altitude running to sleeping, eating and hitting cocktail hour in style – insider intel on the Colorado capital’s attractionsSome used to consider Denver a small town stopover en route to the glamour of Aspen and Vail, but recent years have seen Colorado’s capital emerge as a destination in its own right. Smart city planning has made Denver more accessible than ever. Urban bike trails connect downtown to outer neighbourhoods and the new light rail whisks travellers from Denver International Airport to the buzzy new Union Station hub. Coors Field, home to the Colorado Rockies baseball team, ranks as one of America’s best urban ballparks, and is credited with the renaissance of lower downtown.At the same time, this meat-and-potatoes town has found its culinary groove. The city has a strong brewing heritage, but that’s now complemented by craft beer makers, star chef restaurants, cool cocktail spots and innovative food markets.Outside, the mile high city – nicknamed for its elevation one mile above sea level – delivers sunshine 300 days a year, and has one of the biggest urban park systems in the US, plus Rocky Mountain national park is just a day trip away, so you’ll want to pack your hiking boots as well as your cowboy boots.Plan the ultimate weekend in Denver with this 48 hour itinerary:Friday afternoon: check in and cocktailsCheck into the hot new Ramble hotel, located in River North art district (RiNo). Once home to great stretches of run-down warehouses, this neighbourhood north of downtown has become one of the city’s hippest areas, packed with food halls, urban wineries and of-the-moment restaurants. New York City cocktail gurus Death \u0026amp Co are responsible for everything guests imbibe, from the spirits stocked in the minibar to the handcrafted cocktails served in the hotel’s effortlessly cool drinking areas, which include a glamorous lobby bar, an outdoor garden bar, and an intimate, reservations-needed, mezzanine bar. Each of the 50 rooms feels like a Parisian pied-à-terre, decorated with finds from the owner’s travels to France and Morocco.Friday evening: pan-Latin dim sumA meal at Super Mega Bien, located next door to the Ramble, is like a whirlwind trip through Latin America. First, there’s the decor – a wild display of Mexican lucha libre wrestling masks and wall-to-wall Brazilian street posters. Then there’s the delicious food, inspired by the flavours of Peru, Cuba, Mexico and Brazil. Family-style dim sum portions, plus large-format drinks, make this a great spot to dine with a group. Join uber-fit locals for a 2.3-mile run around Washington Park. And don’t worry, there’s no shame if you need to stop to catch your breath at 1,600 metres. Reward your efforts with a latte and a buttery kouign-amann cake from nearby Devil’s Food Bakery.Discover Denver’s creative side while browsing the galleries, boutiques and studios in the Art District on Santa Fe. Then head over to Stanley Marketplace, where you’ll find more than 50 independently owned business under one roof. There are countless food options, but try to snag a table for brunch at locally loved, farm-to-table spot Annette, and be sure to ask about the quiche of the day.Saturday evening: Mother Nature’s music hallCatching a show at Red Rocks Park \u0026amp Amphitheatre is on more than a few people’s bucket lists. Thirty minutes from downtown Denver, this acoustically perfect concert venue has been carved out of 70m-year-old sandstone rocks. The 2018 summer line-up includes acts like the Avett Brothers, Yo-Yo Ma and Jackson Browne.Denver’s bike-sharing program, called B-cycle, has stations throughout the city. Relatively flat trails, like the Cheery Creek bike path, make for easy urban exploring. Fuel up with brunch at Señor Bear. You can’t go wrong with the chilaquiles or serrano ham-spiked soft scramble though you can easily overdo it on the bottomless sangria. Denver has demonstrated an ability to brew beers of virtually any style. Brewery-hop by bike and sample the sours at Crooked Stave, saisons at Baere Brewing Co, and the IPAs at Comrade Brewing Co.Sunday afternoon: the great outdoorsBreak out your hiking boots and tackle the 355 miles of trails in Rocky Mountain national park. Just 70 miles from Denver, the park makes for a perfect day trip. Out-of-towners can start with the 3.6-mile round-trip hike from Emerald Lake to Bear Lake. It’s great for those still acclimatising to Colorado’s elevation, and affords plenty of Instagram-worthy views.Sunday evening: a taste of la dolce vitaHead to Union Station, a beautifully restored historic landmark that now houses restaurants, coffee shops, bars and boutiques. Book in advance for dinner at the nearby Tavernetta, a sexy new Italian restaurant from the award-winning talents of James Beard. Request a table at the chef’s counter to watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen. Italian wine fans should be prepared to geek out the list here runs long and is updated weekly by wine director Carlin Karr.

Today, she’s the CEO of Icelantic Skis, a Colorado-based, made-in-America ski company that’s recognised worldwide for its vibrant topsheet artwork.Lovelie has adventured far and wide, but Colorado still stands apart for her. “Here, you can explore a new place every weekend and not see the whole thing,” she says. “And you can get really high up really quickly. Mount Evans is 4,267 metres – the stars are brighter up there, the air is crisper, and all within 30 minutes of a major metro area.” As for Denver: “It’s just a cool, hip, up-and-coming city with a lot of young energy,” she says. “There are so many makers and crafters and small businesses, and a lot of people are really into the outdoors.”Any advice for first-time visitors? “Access to wilderness takes effort and energy. There are all sorts of state and government agencies, conservation groups and nonprofits that take care of these places. Take a moment to appreciate the fact that they exist and be mindful about how you leave them.”Rock climbing in Clear Creek CanyonIt’s the best outdoor climbing close to Denver. There are routes for all levels, there’s sport and trad climbing, and you’re on the creek the whole time. Even to just drive around and watch the climbers is a really cool thing to do.Confluence Park This is a great example of nature meeting urban. It’s called Confluence Park because it’s where Cherry Creek and the South Platte River come together in downtown Denver, but I think it’s cool to look at the confluence of urban and nature, too. There’s always a lot of energy there – boaters and people swimming. It’s a really fun place to go. Bentgate MountaineeringBentgate has been around for almost 25 years, with super helpful staff that can answer any questions, and it’s stocked with everything from guidebooks to tents to trail food to climbing shoes. It also hosts cool educational community classes, which are so important for people who are just starting to venture into the outdoors.Topo Designs Everything about this outdoor clothing and gear company just embodies the Colorado lifestyle – the aesthetic, the function, the quality. It’s in the RiNo (River North Art District) neighbourhood, which is one of the coolestparts of town. Movement Climbing + FitnessPeople are moving to Colorado to live this outdoor lifestyle – and climbing is one of the top activities they go for. So it’s no wonder there are so many cool climbing gyms popping up they’re a great way for people to access the sport. South Platte River Trail and Clear Creek Trail They’re beautiful because they run along water and they’re actually used for transportation and commuting in the city. Clear Creek is amazing. Once it’s fully finished you’ll be able to bike from downtown Denver almost all the way to Vail on cycle paths. I think that’s so cool – it should be a destination for bike enthusiasts.New Terrain Brewing Co.New Terrain is housed in a beautiful new building on the east side of North Table Mountain in Golden (about 15 miles west of Denver). The brewery has a big open deck for outdoor drinking and two food trucks that come every day, so there’s always something good to eat. In the summer, there’s live music. It’s a chilled vibe. You just feel like you’re outside in nature. Plus, there’s kombucha on tap for the non-beer drinkers.Happy Leaf KombuchaI think it’s cool to go to a brewery that makes something other than beer – kombucha. It’s like a modern bar. It’s totally Colorado.

There is usually no “probably” about it. Usually any question that looks beyond the next game or requires a prediction from the Liverpool manager prompts a disappointed frown and curt reply but this time is different. This time Klopp accepts it must be different. The question, of course, is whether Liverpool have to end this season not only with progress, positivity and memories of some genuinely thrilling performances but with the first silverware of his Anfield reign? “You are right and people will say that,” he admits. “It is the next step.”There is expectation on Liverpool every summer, as there should be. Questions about that elusive Premier League title are an annual feature of pre-season. This summer they carry greater weight. Having rebuilt expectation over the course of his three seasons as Liverpool manager, and invested over £170m on new talent ahead of the fourth, Klopp cannot and does not shy away from the demand that has intensified on him and his players. There is no frown as Klopp elaborates at length on the aims for a campaign that he is relishing.“It would be the next step and we need to be ready for that,” he continues. “I cannot give guarantees here but I understand if people think that. I know about the expectations and that is completely normal. First of all we have to play the football that gives us an opportunity to win something. We cannot talk about winning something before we start the season. Football is not like cycling so we have lost a lot of things. The other day I put on a session and had to stop it and start again. I was: ‘Four players, one row, that’s how we defend.’ It’s not that the boys wanted to do it a different way but there’s a big change at this moment – new players coming in from another club, players in after a long time out you are starting new more or less. When you have the complete team together you can build on the basis a little bit more. I am confident we can build on last season. It’s not that we lost things completely but you have to work on it to get it back. The football the boys played last year was not easy. There was a lot of work invested into playing like that. That’s what we will do again. I am not in doubt about our basis or that we will reach it again. I want to have the best start ever but we all know that something can happen and then everything is questioned in a second. I don’t want to prepare anyone for a bad start because I don’t want to have one but it is possible, I cannot ignore that completely.Optimism would be rife at Anfield even without a successful transfer window that has seen Liverpool strengthen in key areas at considerable expense. The Brazil international Alisson, signed for a world record fee for a goalkeeper of £65m, Naby Keïta, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri have all been bought for more money than Klopp spent in his seven years at Borussia Dortmund. Liverpool opened their pre-season tour of the United States with a 3-1 defeat by the German’s former club in Charlotte on Sunday, once again fielding a team that will be unrecognisable from the side that starts the Premier League opener against West Ham United, and face City in New Jersey on Wednesday and United in Michigan on Saturday.Liverpool’s belief is built on more than lavish spending. Last season’s exhilarating run to the Champions League final, Mohamed Salah’s record-breaking debut campaign of 44 goals and a defence bolstered by the £75m signing of Virgil van Dijk, plus the emergence of Trent Alexander-Arnold and blossoming of Andy Robertson, are significant factors.An unbeaten home league record last season and scoring four or more goals in 14 matches – the most in 121 years – provide more. Now, with midfield options multiplied and the long-running, costly goalkeeping problem acknowledged, expectation carries a demand. Klopp accepts that means silverware, although insists progress is measured in various ways.Despite ending City’s unbeaten league sequence and swatting them aside 5-1 on aggregate in the Champions League quarter-final the reality, one that cuts into the feelgood factor at Anfield, is that Liverpool finished 25 points behind Pep Guardiola’s champions last season. They also took one point fewer than in 2016-17 as Klopp navigated a route to Kiev while unable to rotate his midfield due to several injuries. Liverpool also finished behind Tottenham Hotspur and United despite losing two games fewer than both. Twelve draws, compared with United’s six and Spurs’ eight, represent an obvious area for improvement.“It is, of course, consistency,” claims Klopp, when asked how Liverpool take that next step and bridge the gap with City. “It is not just that we have to be more consistent, we have to create circumstances where we can be more consistent. Nobody is consistent with 11 players. What we are working on is the depth of the squad because you need it. The first part of last season when we did the rotation and we were quite active with it, I think we did six or seven changes from one game or the other, we still had quality on the pitch that felt perfect. As long as you could do that it was really good. We need to make sure we can do that much longer over the season and that is only possible if you have the squad.City’s flying start to last season put them in effect beyond Liverpool’s reach before Klopp’s team found their rhythm. The Liverpool manager believes the World Cup, and the involvement until the latter stages of several players from his club, City, Spurs and United, could hinder a repeat by any of the title contenders.“The first games are absolutely important,” he says. “I don’t ask for an easy way. I think City had more players in the semis than we had, Tottenham for sure, so it’s not that we have the biggest problems. But it’s not like the good old times when you had your squad for six weeks in pre-season and spent one week team-building by going to a forest in Sweden with nothing to eat, like I did when I was young. That’s not possible any more.“We are used to these circumstances. We have West Ham and Crystal Palace to start with and that’s tough enough. I don’t know how many players West Ham had at the World Cup but they are signing player after player and they will be a new team for sure. It’s a tough start, as the Premier League always is, but I am fine with that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/553886d3424aff4df4b4416dced251d0c8e6b752/0_22_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6410c4da10292e733a8dc5945774f1f","title":"loris karius homework stay liverpool goalkeeper","story":"Maybe, just maybe, Loris Karius needs to stop seeing himself as an artist and start thinking like a scientist? Perhaps his faith in the powers of instinct could do with being underpinned with a few more specific details?Liverpool’s goalkeeper has been having a rough time of things at work – or at least rough by the standards of anyone commanding a basic wage of around £25,000 a week – since his two glaring errors in the Champions League final defeat against Real Madrid in May.Undiagnosed concussion was subsequently cited as the cause of the German goalkeeper’s two concentration lapses in Kiev and Klopp was sympathy personified – before swiftly spending £65m on Roma’s Alisson. That decision appears vindicated by a few, instantly magnified, errors made by\u0026nbspKarius in pre-season games which\u0026nbspserved as a cruel reminder that, while outfield players can often\u0026nbspget away with myriad mistakes, goalkeepers rarely succeed in camouflaging slip-ups.Following a 3-1 defeat against Borussia Dortmund in North Carolina – a setback in which Karius was judged responsible for conceding two goals – the Twitter-sphere turned hostile and hysterical. “To those who take joy in seeing other people fail or suffer, I feel for you,” the keeper retaliated in an emotional post. “Whatever it is that’s happening in your life to hold this much anger and hate, I pray that\u0026nbspit passes and good things come\u0026nbspto you.”Mohamed Salah felt moved to intervene. “Stay strong Karius,” the Liverpool striker tweeted. “It has happened to the best players. Ignore those who hate.”Sound advice indeed but the keeper could possibly question the implicit trust he places in instinct. Asked, last season, if he made a point of studying strikers’ idiosyncrasies, Karius said: “It’s not something I particularly do. To a certain point it’s good to analyse but, at the end of the day, you don’t know what’s going to happen.”Such a fatalistic approach seems at odds with a character obsessed by the fine details of his nutrition and sleep quality but Karius believes the goalkeeper’s art to be “extremely instinctive”. He has a DVD library of impressive saves made for Mainz and Liverpool to endorse that point but it is also true that the best footballers tend to supplement the video preparation routinely done with club analysts by burning the midnight oil at home.The Everton and England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford spends hours studying the movement and technique of opponents. When last September Pickford stretched out a foot to deny\u0026nbspJermain Defoe a goal at Goodison Park with the Bournemouth striker clean through, he explained it was down to having prepared by visualising assorted scenarios involving Defoe and researching what he was most likely to do.“I’d done my homework so I didn’t have to guess,” said Pickford. “I was pretty sure Jermain would put his shot to my right so I waited, he did, I saved it and we won.”If a lack of research did not prompt the fumbled free-kick which handed Tranmere a goal against Karius in another pre-season friendly at Prenton Park, a blend of pressure and lost confidence was surely responsible.Professor Steve Peters, the sports psychiatrist who has worked extensively with Liverpool in recent\u0026nbspyears, predicted it would take\u0026nbspKarius three months to recover from his Kiev trauma.The problem for Karius is that, by August, Alisson could well be Klopp’s established No\u0026nbsp1. “Of course that’s not perfect for me,” the 25-year-old agreed. So might he depart before next month’s transfer deadline? “I don’t know,” he replied. “I cannot say what I’m doing right now.” Considering that Liverpool’s manager paid Mainz a modest – in a Premier League context – £4.75m for Karius and bought him primarily to challenge Simon Mignolet, Klopp possibly regards the German’s signing as a relatively low-risk gamble that did not quite pay idends.The question now is what happens next? With Karius’s wages beyond many club budgets and a contract until 2021, a loan deal seems quite likely. Alternatively, if Mignolet moves on – possibly to a reserve role at Barcelona – a return to the Anfield bench may yet beckon.Once there he would be an Alisson injury away from a dramatic recall and a starring role in one of those redemption narratives around which\u0026nbspfootball revolves. But first Karius could do worse than remember the adage about the devil really being in the detail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f05a242fda7800b82f575f21fa0f300531fcee3f/0_453_3691_2215/master/3691.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=374a6e869d29639d08386449a6cac465","title":"mesut ozil international retirement germany","story":"When a Radio 5 Live newsreader referred to “the English rider Geraint Thomas” in an item on the Tour de France this week, the response from those with Welsh blood in their veins ranged from a pained wince to a weary shrug. It was ignorant. It was annoying. But no one was going to war over it.In other countries and other sports the question of national identity can provoke very different reactions. This week, for instance, Mesut Özil announced his retirement from international football over the response in Germany – and from the head of the DFB, the German football association, in particular – to a row that began when he posed for a photograph with the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in London in May.Özil’s grandfather moved from Turkey to Germany as a gastarbeiter in the 1970s, settling in Gelsenkirchen, in the industrial Ruhr, where Mesut was born in 1988. His mother, he says, taught him not to forget where he came from. “I have two hearts,” he wrote in a statement\u0026nbspresponding to the initial furore, “one German\u0026nbspand one Turkish.”Erdoğan was in London to visit the Queen and Theresa\u0026nbspMay. In itself, plenty of people were unhappy about that. While dismantling the secular state established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk almost 100 years ago, he puts dissenting journalists in prison and calls them terrorists. Still, it seemed to be acceptable for the monarch and her prime minister to have their photograph taken with him on his visit to London. But not a footballer who was born to Turkish parents and has lived in Britain for the past five years.Depending on our political perspective, you or I might recoil from the thought of standing alongside such an autocrat. But we might also try to understand the choice made by Özil – and by another man in the offending photograph, Ilkay Gündoğan, the Manchester City player and a fellow member of the Germany World Cup squad, whose grandfather also moved from Turkey to Gelsenkirchen, and who was invited to London to meet Erdoğan. Özil’s explanation for his decision was calm and lucid. “Not meeting the president would have been disrespecting the roots of my ancestors, who I know would be proud of where I am today,” he said. “For me, it\u0026nbspdidn’t matter who was president, it mattered that it was the president.”Had he gone on to play brilliantly in the World Cup, and had Germany as a result made a respectable defence of the title he helped them to win four years ago, all of it would now be forgotten, or at least ignored. But he did not. Yet although he was far from the only one to blame for the team’s disastrous showing, he was chosen as its symbol – most publicly by Reinhard Grindel, the president of the DFB, who had wanted him out of the squad but who had been dissuaded by Joachim Löw, the head coach, and Oliver Bierhoff, the team’s off-the-field manager.Löw and Bierhoff had the support of Frank-Walter Steinmaier, the president of the German federal republic. After the initial row Steinmaier had met Özil, listened sympathetically to his story, and issued – apparently to Grindel’s dismay – a joint statement with the player.Failure in Russia provided the excuse for renewal of the criticisms, and not just by Grindel and the keyboard warriors of the social media. Uli Hoeness, the Bayern Munich president and a World Cup winner during his playing days, also piled in. “For me Mesut Özil has been a poor excuse for a footballer for years,” he said. “He should ask himself when he last won a tackle.” Nothing there about Thomas Müller, a Bayern player who also disappointed in Russia.“In the eyes of Grindel and his supporters, I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose,” Özil said in a new statement on Sunday. “Despite paying taxes in Germany, donating facilities to German schools and winning the World Cup with Germany in 2014, I am still not accepted into society.”The affair is symptomatic of a world under strain. During the World Cup two Switzerland players of Kosovan descent, Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka, were fined by Fifa for making the sign of the Albanian double eagle after scoring against Serbia, Kosovo’s enemy in the war of 1998-99. Even the ultimate champions were forced to listen to complaints inside their own country that the World Cup had been won by an “African” team. When a website tweeted a list of France’s squad members with the name of each player accompanied by the flag representing his family’s origin, the full-back Benjamin Mendy answered by reposting the list with each flag replaced by the tricolore. “Fixed,” he added.To Germany’s Islamophobes and extreme right, Turkish immigrants such as the Özils and the Gündoğans are guest workers who never did the decent thing and went back. Some in Britain feel the same way about our Afro-Caribbean and South Asian populations they worked in our hospitals, on our buses and in our sweat-shops, and now it’s time for them to go “home”. And yet a squad containing 11 players of black or mixed ethnicity went to Russia and restored pride in the idea of an England team. For once, multiculturalism seemed to regain the upper hand. Sadly, in a polarising world, the suspicion must be that it’s all paper-thin. As France’s\u0026nbspcelebrations died down last week, L’Équipe’s cartoonist depicted a wife saying to her TV-watching husband, “I thought the World Cup of football was over,” and getting the reply: “Yes, but the World Cup of bullshit has just begun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af20c381df6a0c138236c6016614c248e60c9540/0_157_4250_2550/master/4250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baefdad5f3981e6e99179b9e818eb33d","title":"cristiano ronaldo juventus italian clubs bust bari","story":"Juventus agreed to pay Cristiano Ronaldo €500,000 a week in wages while Bari had their water cut off over a €6,000 billBy Neil Morris for The Gentleman Ultra of the Sport NetworkWhile Juventus and Real Madrid finessed the details of Cristiano Ronaldo’s transfer, a distant funeral bell tolled for three historic Italian clubs – a scenario that accentuated the disparity between those at the top of Italian football and those a few rungs down the ladder. Ronaldo’s arrival has been hailed as a coup for the Italian game. Apparently he will raise the profile of Serie A to a level not seen since the 1990s and everyone will reap the benefits. But few fans outside Turin subscribe to this “trickle-down” theory.The news that Bari and Cesena of Serie B, as well as AC Reggiana of Serie C, have all been denied licences for the upcoming season due to financial issues will hardly come as a surprise to anyone who follows Italian football. Since Fiorentina went bankrupt in 2002, 153 Italian clubs have refounded, merged with other clubs or disappeared altogether. Three clubs have dropped from Serie B to Serie D this summer due to financial problems even though none of them finished in the relegation zone.One way or another, most of these clubs return. New legal entities are formed, new owners are found and the clubs begin again in the lower leagues. Some rise from the ashes and thrive. Napoli were refounded in 2004 and nearly won Serie A last season. Parma completed their comeback to the top flight in May, just three seasons after the third rebirth in their history. But the resurrection process can be long and painful for fans. This is a new experience for Bari, who were founded in 1908, and Cesena, who have been meandering through the professional leagues since 1940. That’s 188 years of football history signed away with a stroke of a pen.How did it come to this for Bari, the club of Gordon Cowans and David Platt? In May 2014, after three decades in the hands of the Matarrese family, Bari found new owners, with former referee Gianluca Paparesta the public face of a group who paid €4.8m for the club in a bankruptcy auction. The Matarreses had effectively washed their hands of the club in 2011, leaving the club to stagnate for three years and amass debts of €30m.From then on, the atmosphere around the club changed. Redevelopment plans for the San Nicola stadium were rejected, with Bari’s mayor Antonio Decaro refusing to commit any money from taxpayers. The club were offered a long-term lease and the freedom to develop the ground but, with no funds available, the plans were shelved and the San Nicola was left to quietly crumble, poignantly reflecting the situation behind the scenes.By January 2018, rumours surfaced of wages not being paid, prompting fines from the tax office. In March, it was confirmed that the club was €16m in debt. With no assets to raise funds, promotion was their only hope. The players made it to the play-offs but a two-point penalty for financial irregularities gave them a tougher draw and they failed to reach Serie A.The stadium’s water supply was cut last month due to an unpaid bill of €6,000. At the same time, the club were trying to raise €5m to pay outstanding wages, pension contributions and the registration fee required to compete in Serie B this season. Talks with Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani collapsed and Giancaspro, now under investigation for financial irregularities, walked away from the club.Life outside the top flight has always been a strain for Bari. Their architecturally acclaimed stadium – known as the “Spaceship” – was originally built for Italia 90 and has long been a drain on resources, with neither the club nor the council able to find a sustainable solution. The playing squad always came second to the stadium and sustaining top-flight football proved an impossible task. It’s a similar tale across the peninsula as clubs struggle to maintain municipal stadiums. Even Juventus could not fill the Stadio delle Alpi, the ground thrust upon them in 1990, eventually replacing it with the smaller and more cost-effective Juventus Stadium.The last few years have been exhausting for Bari fans. Issues around the stadium, the revolving door of coaches and players, and a hike in ticket prices during the Giancasparo era have all eroded enthusiasm. The club that attracted 50,000 to the Serie B play-off against Latina in 2014 could only sell 20,000 tickets for their play-off against Novara in 2016. When demotion finally came last week the city’s mayor, Antonio Decaro, declared it “a day of defeat, which burns 1,000 times more than any defeat on the pitch.” Yet this will hopefully not be the end. Revival plans began on Friday as Decaro spoke in front of 4,000 fans at the club’s old ground, the Stadio della Vittoria, where they will likely return. The mayor wants the football authorities to give Bari a place in Serie C in light of their sporting heritage, but that idea is unlikely to fly. New investors have emerged, but details remain vague.Jeremy Bowling, a season-ticket holder at the club since 2009, sums up the mood: “The city, the province and the Tifosi are devastated – us Brits too, who were taken in and welcomed. I am not sure how I am going to fill the void. A city that can send 50,000 to a play-off game deserved better stewardship than this.” Mark Neale, who has been following the club for 35 years, was also stunned: “As the deadline passed, everything was silent. Then fans on Facebook were doing live videos with tears in their eyes.”“The cockerel has failed, 110 years of red and white history has failed, says lifelong Bari fan Alfred Ricci. “When you kill the rooster, when you cut off his head, he lives on for a while. Bari never dies. The people of Bari never die. The resurrection will start again from Serie D. We will be there with our scarves, singing, honouring today, yesterday and forever the white and red colours.”Bari and Cesena will draw inspiration from clubs such as Napoli and Fiorentina who have risen again after suffering similar fates, while Reggiana will try to avoid the mistakes they made after they last refounded in 2005. There may be new names, new stadiums, new opponents and new owners, but the fans remain constant. No amount of accounting, investigating and legal reporting can take away the passion of those who will continue to give life to a club, even after the obituaries have been written.• This article first appeared on The Gentleman Ultra• Follow Neil Morris and The Gentleman Ultra on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/138787b11ac016d24798e1dc3fa621d7ebb98b2a/13_1_1272_763/master/1272.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05255d095f5912d0508d1b891976635e","title":"fluffed it the truth about build a bears day of mayhem","story":"The global company was once lauded for being ahead of the curve, so what was behind the ‘pay-your-age’ misjudgment that left scores of its little customers brokenhearted?Thursday 12 July should have been a red-letter day for thousands upon thousands of kids, and for their favourite shop, Build-A-Bear Workshop. The company had announced a pay-your-age promotion, so customers in the UK, US and Canada could come in to make their own teddies and pay just a fraction of the normal cost: instead of £52 for a top-of-the-range bear, a six-year-old would pay just £6. It sounded brilliant.What Build-A-Bear hadn’t factored in was the devotion of its young customers, and the unending human appetite for getting something cheap. Its shops were overwhelmed with huge queues wanting to take advantage. Police had to be called to help control the crowds outside the Leeds branch. Scores of shops had to close early thousands of people left without getting in. Even some of those who did left wildly disappointed: one parent told the BBC that she and her children queued for three and a half hours to get into the Derby branch, then spent another two hours waiting to get their bears stuffed: “When I look back I will probably think, ‘What have I done that for?’ – especially with what I will end up paying for parking,” she said. The next day’s headlines contained the words no executive wants to see describing their business: “chaos”, “carnage”, “fiasco”.You might have thought Build-A-Bear would take urgent action to ensure a different outcome when its US stores opened, hours later, but no. Ben Bigalke and his three-and-a-half-year-old daughter Astrid arrived at their local Build-A-Bear Workshop in Minnesota’s Mall of America at 9.30am – 3.30pm UK time, several hours into the day of disaster. “The area around the store was completely packed with ensconced, almost camped-out customers,” he tells me by email. “The line zigzagged through the mall’s first floor and wound its way entirely through the theme park in the centre of the mall to the other side of the mall. It seemed like a quarter-mile-long line, at least. We learned later that people began camping out at 6am and there were probably more than 500 people – maybe 1,000 – in line before the store even opened. We were nowhere near the store.”In Minnesota, despite what had already happened in the UK, the events came as a complete surprise to all concerned. The Build-A-Bear store staff didn’t tell customers about how long they might be waiting, or what was happening. “I asked a security guard what to expect and they said they were upset by the situation, saying it was unexpected and that they were not prepared or even forewarned that something like that could happen,” Bigalke says. “They didn’t have any information about how many hours we could be expected to stay in line for, and I feel like they should have known. There also should have been representatives from the store telling us what was happening and what to expect.”Pay-your-age was the first major disaster in Build-A-Bear’s 21-year history, during which time the company has usually been ahead of the game, both as a retailer and a mythmaker. It is rare that a shopping chain has an origin story – its US founder, Maxine Clark, had been shopping with a friend’s children when the little girl commented that they should make their own bears in the absence of anything new in the shops. A lightbulb went on in Clark’s head. Of course, it wasn’t quite as homespun as that: Clark was an experienced retail executive, who had worked for the May Co department store company and been president of Payless ShoeSource. She knew what she was doing.The first part of Clark’s genius – and it was genius – was to anticipate what was to prove the most important shopping development of the internet age before it was de rigueur: experiential retailing. In summer 1998 – a year after Clark set up her first Build-A-Bear Workshop in St Louis, Missouri – Harvard Business Review published Welcome to the Experience Economy, an influential essay that set out the path ahead. “From now on, leading-edge companies – whether they sell to consumers or businesses – will find that the next competitive battleground lies in staging experiences,” wrote its authors. “An experience is not an amorphous construct it is as real an offering as any service, good, or commodity … Businesses must deliberately design engaging experiences that command a fee. This transition from selling services to selling experiences will be no easier for established companies to undertake and weather than the last great economic shift, from the industrial to the service economy.”This was precisely Clark’s business plan. Build-A-Bear has an eight-step process: “Choose Me, Hear Me, Stuff Me, Stitch Me, Fluff Me, Dress Me, Name Me, and Take Me Home.” Everyone who buys from one of Build-A-Bear’s 361 stores or 102 franchised shops – in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Denmark and China – has the same experience. They choose an outer skin from more than 30 options they select a sound chip to go inside (it can be a prerecorded sound, or one they record themselves) they add in a small satin heart (the part of the process that is the most emotionally rewarding, or manipulative, depending on your point of view) they get it stuffed to “just the right amount of huggability” they get the bear sewn up, with a unique barcode for future online participation they get the fur fluffed they accessorise it with clothes and extras. They give it a name to be put on a birth certificate and “passport” (I know of one parent who always takes his children’s bear passport on business trips, in order to buy something from the local Build-A-Bear Workshop and get the passport stamped). Then they are given the bear in a special carrying case to take home.“I think they did something incredibly clever,” says Corin Birchall, founder of the retail consultancy Kerching. “You pick away at the corners and there’s not actually a lot to it. But it absolutely captured kids’ imaginations and turned this commodity into a tangibly valuable product. At all retailers across the world, as the internet makes the market more global, a retailer’s job is to add tangible value to their place in the sale journey. I can’t think of another retailer that has added more value to the process. It’s just incredible how well they can monetise something that seems intangible to an adult. They were ahead of the curve in doing that.”And, for kids, the intangible really is something magical. Nicola Hunt’s nine-year-old daughter, Jenna, has nine bears and the associated accessories – the bears are from parties and gifts, the accessories (where Build-A-Bear makes a huge chunk of its revenue) bought with birthday money. The number of accessories seems unending, all priced at what appears a reasonable level inidually, but capable of mounting up: £4.50 for a pair of bear sunglasses, £14 for a tent, £8 for a sleeping bag, £2 for a headband, and on and on and on.While Hunt feels disquiet at the hard sell given to parents, she admires the way the staff interact with children who visit the stores. “I like the actual process of choosing a bear, I like the way they put the heart in and you give it a kiss. But the bears are overpriced, the quality isn’t good and you can’t wash them.” Nevertheless, she has seen how important her bears have been to Jenna. “She was very unwell last year and in and out of hospital,” she says. “One of the things we did was go to Build-A-Bear and get a bear to go through the process with her. That was really helpful. When she had a drip in her arm, the Build-A-Bear had a drip in its arm. There was something very special about it.”The second part of Clark’s genius was choosing the teddy bear, a toy that has remained fundamentally unchanged since coming to the market 115 years ago. “The teddy bear has become an icon, a symbol of childhood, which is why campaigns aimed at children use the image of a bear – think of Pudsey,” says Deborah Jaffé, author of The History of Toys. “The teddy was the first really mass-produced soft toy. But it was just chance it was bear – it could have been a dog or a monkey. But a bear is a simple shape to make and doesn’t use much material. It’s not as complicated as, say, making an elephant.”They remain popular, Jaffé says, not just because of their simplicity and sweetness – and, truthfully, who does not love a nice teddy bear? – but because animals can stand in for humans in a universal way: bears have neither race nor gender. “You get this in children’s book illustrations: in order to get round gender stereotyping or race and ethnicity, it’s easy to use the animal rather than a human form. When you put a human form in, it gets much more complicated. Mattel have had to make Barbie in lots of ethnicities – but you don’t have to do that with an animal.”Clark had hit on the perfect combination: a universal product and a new way to sell it, and then to continue to sell. By registering each bear with a unique code before it leaves the store, Build-A-Bear gives its young customers the chance to continue participating – and spending – in the Build-A-Bear experience online once they get home: as well as buying yet more stuff, they can participate in Build-A-Bear’s world. “Our website lets children create virtual versions of themselves and their animals and interact with each other online,” Clark explained in 2013.Even before data was such a valuable commodity, Clark had created an idea that meant Build-A-Bear knew more about its customers’ tastes than most toy retailers. As its senior marketing manager for digital explained in 2015: “We’re looking at the data from a macro level to understand whether a particular product resonates with a girl who’s four years old or 12 years old, and as you market to the mother, how do you continue to tell the mother about additional pets or accessories and fashions? We’re starting to get into this from a digital perspective with our loyalty members where we have that type of data collection because they chose the option of us continuing to market to them on a one-to-one basis.”By the time Clark stepped down as CEO in 2013, the company had generated $5bn (£3.8bn) in sales. It also continued to expand its “experiential offering”. As Clark’s reign drew to a close, it was introducing “HyperSound directional audio technology” into some of its stores, which would let Build-A-Bear run multiple interactive kiosks within its shops, offering a specific audio message to customers. Directional audio is yet another of the techniques used by retailers to try to prolong time in-store and increase the amount they spend. Or, as the website Retail Customer Experience put it: “By using directional audio retailers can create an immersive 3D sound environment confined to a specific area … Those outside of the zone don’t hear the sound, and for the shopper the experience is similar to wearing headphones, except they aren’t wearing headphones … The memorable experience delivered via directional audio adds a ‘wow’ factor that increases the effectiveness of advertising messages, ultimately leading to increased sales.”Fearing kids were being lost to screens, it partnered with Samsung to place interactive stations in shops, so customers could build their bears without any of the burdensome physical or personal interaction of the traditional experience.But times aren’t necessarily easy for Build-A-Bear. It made a loss in 2013, when Clark left, before bouncing back into profit. Its 2017 annual report notes that total revenues have declined year-on-year since 2014 last year’s profits are little more than half its 2014 levels. The report admits one of the main contributors to a consolidated net income increase over the previous year was “an increase in gift card breakage revenue”. In short, a big chunk of its profit was down to kids accidentally snapping gift cards they’d been given, and being unable to redeem them.The pay-your-age promotion was meant to be the start of a new thrust. By making it open only to members of the Build-A-Bear Bonus Club, it hoped to entice scores of new customers to register. Doubtless they succeeded. Unfortunately, the offer they made was just too good. In the wake of the fiasco, a YouGov poll found that while awareness of the brand had rocketed, that awareness was almost entirely negative.And, as Birchall observes, the episode was entirely avoidable. First, he says, it is “quite alarming” how badly Build-A-Bear underestimated the level of demand. What’s more, the fact that the whole appeal of the shop is based on a time-consuming experience means it does not lend itself to events with acute peaks of traffic, rather than steady flows. “I can’t fathom how they could be that far out.”At this point, it would be apt to give the last word to Build-A-Bear. I sent them 15 questions, most of which were purely factual, and some specifically about the pay-your-age promotion. After due consideration, the company’s PR people sent back their response. “We greatly appreciate your interest in this story. We are still reviewing and analysing, so we’re not able to answer most of your questions at this time. That said, we did want to share the press release regarding the Build-A-Bear Count Your Candles program to ensure you had the full details on this program that launched last week.”So I go to Brent Cross shopping centre in north London, to the branch hidden away inside the Fenwick department store. There were no customers there on a warm Wednesday morning during term time. Can I speak to the manager, please? Yes, that’s me. Would you be willing to tell me what it was like to be in charge on the Thursday of pay-your-age? She looks panicked and says she has to call her boss. A couple of minutes later, she returns. “We’re not allowed to talk to anyone. No interviews.”At Build-A-Bear, the PR shutters are down. But the bears still sit there in their rows, waiting to be stuffed, fluffed, named and taken home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4f54049158c549e2d90d9a3d9c1014fa414940/273_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b3caf6bfd768ce65f2641075ac2be99","title":"drivers name england worst motorway service station thurrock m25","story":"Thurrock site receives lowest satisfaction rating as toilet renovation works take tollThurrock services on the M25 have been rated by users as the worst in England, in a survey of motorway service stations.

Drivers tell us they feel less stressed and more awake.”But operators needed “to focus on ensuring customers see their experience as value for the money they have paid – that there is good range of food on offer and that buildings are maintained to a high standard”. A spokesman for Moto said: “We are conscious that major redevelopment works at Thurrock and Toddington South had a negative impact on our customers’ perceptions, especially during washroom improvement work. There is still much work to do on improving customer satisfaction even more.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a53ecaadf0fcffb406163265c0401501ff1040/16_15_4148_2490/master/4148.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9299377ffbe4530d29c3d51dfe133f88","title":"poorest 30 of uk households worse off by between 50 to 150 last year","story":"Thinktank says since 2010 child poverty has risen twice as fast as official figures showThe Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank, said its audit of income and poverty levels for 2017-2018 found that income growth slowed for all households last year. The report comes at a time when the government faces accusations that cutbacks to tax credits are pushing low-income families into poverty while the successor, universal credit, is technically flawed, leading to long delays and miscalculated payments.The thinktank said a wide-ranging review of child poverty showed it fell further than official figures show in the New Labour years until 2010, taking thousands more children out of poverty than previously believed, and has risen more sharply during the period of austerity over the past eight years.“Child poverty actually fell from 3 million in 1998-99 to around 1.6 million in 2010-2011 – rather than falling from 3.3 million to 2.3 million, with half a million more children taken out of poverty than official surveys suggest,” the report read. “This means the target to halve child poverty between 1998 and 2010 was almost met, rather than being missed by 600,000 children as previously thought.”Since 2010 child poverty has been rising twice as fast since as official figures show, it said.Adam Corlett, a senior economic analyst at the foundation, said: “Reducing child poverty has been a goal of politicians from all parties in recent decades. But our analysis shows that child poverty is likely to have risen last year and that rises since 2010 have been underestimated in official government data.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c63d37dcb1e5ef7ea75b0fb81291d195d4acf8/380_215_4274_2564/master/4274.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99b82ff69417f23b84975b359ba9d02c","title":"now pop compilation 100 that s what i call music","story":"Now That’s What I Call Music’s 100th edition includes a greatest hits disc that favours the arena titans – overlooking the pleasure of rediscovering the one-hit wonders and sub-genres buried in these pop time capsulesReleased on 20 July, the 100th edition of Now That’s What I Call Music shifts from its regular programming: instead of summarising the last quarter in pop, the second disc condenses 35 years of Now into 80 minutes. It uses the biggest names – UB40, Phil Collins, Wet Wet Wet, Kylie, the Justins (Timberlake and Bieber), Coldplay – to tell its story, which rather misses the point. Now compilations are tamper-proof time capsules, where the most pleasure is found in one-hit wonders and sub-genres that were genuinely – but only briefly – popular. They are proof that history isn’t always written by the winners.Here is how it could have looked. (Listen along below.)The most significant sound of 1983 – for teenagers and the future of pop – was electro, represented on the first Now by the Rocksteady Crew with Hey You, which sounded like Peppermint Patty jumped ship from Peanuts while holidaying in the Bronx. Frankie Goes to Hollywood were huge in 84, and over by 85, but Propaganda (Dr Mabuse, Now 3) foreshadowed a new kind of European pop. Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder created a sad goodbye to the era (Together in Electric Dreams, Now 4) and British pop went into hibernation for much of the rest of the decade. US music became dominant on the dancefloor, with Prince’s success creating space for Cameo (Single Life, Now 6) and glorious one-offs such as Sly Fox’s Let’s Go All the Way (Now 7).Not all was hopeless in mid-80s Britain. Stock, Aitken and Waterman, before they relied too heavily on pre-set buttons, gave us Mel and Kim’s weekend anthem Showing Out (Now 8), while mild experimentalism came via the Communards’ creepy So Cold the Night (Now 9), which used the bassoon as a rhythmic instrument. It wasn’t enough. Some turned to soft metal and the Brontëan passion of Heart’s Alone on Now 10, but the slick and tinny high-80s sound was dying by 1988 Johnny Hates Jazz’s puny but endearing Turn Back the Clock (Now 11) desperately attempting to stop the 90s from ever beginning.The rising sound of 1988 came from Chicago, and the media panic over acid house, but London played its part: the aerosol snare of Theme from S-Express (Now 12) signified an imminent DIY future for dance music. Soul II Soul (Back to Life, Now 15) instigated Paul Oakenfold’s Movement 98 and a tranche of early Ibiza-friendly 98bpm records (the Grid’s Floatation JT \u0026amp the Big Family’s Moments in Soul). By 1990, the primary colours of acid house and the frivolity of hip house resulted in Betty Boo (Where Are You Baby, Now 18) becoming a Smash Hits cover star. The major labels, iron-fisted in the 80s, had lost control of pop and in the chaos the KLF (3AM Eternal, Now 19) became 1991’s biggest selling singles act in Europe. The underground went overground – breakbeat-led hardcore (SL2’s On a Ragga Tip, Now 22) was the foundation stone of jungle, drum and bass, and genres yet to come.Enough futurism – there was other stuff going on. Latin superstar Gloria Estefan was one of the biggest artists of the 90s never to have featured on a Now, but Jon Secada was her songwriter and backing singer, and the slippery, discomforting chords of his Just Another Day (Now 23) went Top 5 in 1992. A TV ad for the Soft Reggae compilation went with the bawled tagline “The softest reggae yet!” – as if L’Oréal had been trying to perfect a formula. UB40’s sound was inescapable in the early 90s, but Chaka Demus \u0026amp Pliers’ Tease Me (Now 25), was soft, witty, and should be an oldies radio staple. The Brit awards saw the future in the form of Guiseley’s Tasmin Archer, (Sleeping Satellite, Now 26), named 1993’s best British breakthrough act – they were wrong.Britpop’s year is remembered as 1995, but dance music was bigger, invigorated by happy hardcore (N-Trance’s Set You Free, Now 30), uplifting handbag house (Livin’ Joy’s Dreamer, Now 31) and whatever the Bucketheads’ joyous disco cut-up The Bomb was meant to be. Oasis aside, the most consistently successful UK act between 1993 and 1997 weren’t Pulp or Suede but Eternal (Power of a Woman, Now 32), whose run of homegrown, Topshop R\u0026ampB singles – 12 Top 10 hits between 93 and 97, twice as many as Pulp, Shed Seven, Sleeper and Menswear combined – ran parallel to Britpop.Spice Girls (Say You’ll Be There, Now 35) brought back a bubblegum sensibility in 1996 that dominated British chart pop for the rest of the nineties (All Saints’ I Know Where It’s At, Now 38 Steps’ Heartbeat, Now 41 Billie’s Honey to the Bee, Now 42). On Now 40, Aqua’s Doctor Jones – the second of three No 1s – was up against portentously titled post-Britpop items such as the Verve’s Sonnet and Legacy by Mansun.A new sound was needed for a new century. Still in demand in 2018 according to posters dotted around the North Circular, DJ Luck and MC Neat’s A Little Bit of Luck (Now 45) was urban, British, minimal and hard as nails, while So Solid Crew’s 21 Seconds (Now 50) was arguably the last time the media was scared by a No 1 single. British bubblegum was killed off by the more grownup, complex and beautifully baffling R\u0026ampB emerging from the US at the turn of the century. Sisterhood may have suffered with the breakups of 90s R\u0026ampB groups such as Jade, TLC and En Vogue, but solo singers produced a new golden age of R\u0026ampB (Aaliyah’s More Than a Woman, Now 51 Ashanti’s Foolish, Now 52 Kelis’s Milkshake, Now 57). Previously a backroom songwriter, Christina Milian produced a masterpiece in Dip It Low (Now 58) – it’s a scandal of Vienna-type proportions that it was held off No 1 in 2004 by the tiresome Fuck ItF.U.R.B. (Fuck You Right Back) craze.Almost undocumented by the music press but huge north of the Wash in the early 00s was the Blackburn-based All Around the World label, which provided donk-heavy foot fodder from acts such as N-Trance, Aquagen and Ultrabeat (Pretty Green Eyes, Now 56). Down south, 3 of a Kind were the ultimate one-hit wonder – one single, one No 1 hit in Babycakes, a last gasp of UK garage and one of its most endearing moments. Based in rural Kent, Britain’s Xenomania production team had scored their first No 1 in 2002 with Sugababes’ Round Round (Now 53) but by 2006 their main project, Girls Aloud (Biology, Now 62), had become broadsheet critical darlings. Girls Aloud were, of course, the product of the 2000s’ talent show craze. While you have to wade through a swamp of Sneddons to find anything else worthwhile, Shayne Ward’s Max Martin-produced gem No U Hang Up (Now 68) is worth a nod.Girls Aloud’s Something Kinda Ooooh and Justin Timberlake’s equally invigorating SexyBack fought drear like Snow Patrol’s Chasing Cars and America by Razorlight on Now 65. The Magic Numbers (Forever Lost, Now 61) were physical and musical exceptions in a landfill indie landscape of identikit Wombats, Maccabees, Frays, Views and Hoosiers. There was a brief flutter of excitement as a bunch of exciting and excitable female-fronted guitar bands (CSS, New Young Pony Club, the Gossip) emerged in the mid ‘00s: the Gossip’s Standing in the Way of Control was on Now 66, alongside the first appearance by Calvin Harris who, along with David Guetta (Flames, Now 100), seems set to remain a Now regular until the apocalypse. Amerie’s Take Control (Now 67) provided a more imaginative way of using guitar riffs than any band in the UK could manage, though it presaged the oddly rock-heavy summer of 2008 (Sex on Fire, I Kissed a Girl, Pink’s So What).November 2008: in came Obama and, lo, a new lightness (Shakira’s She Wolf, Now 74), playfulness (Lady Gaga’s run of 2009 No 1s), and a sense of something regained (Alicia Keys’ Empire State of Mind, Now 75). This optimism soon bled into an over-ripe maximalism, and some of the scientifically loudest records ever made (Rihanna’s Only Girl (In the World), Now 77). Meanwhile, David Cameron’s Britain dabbled in the darker arts of loud but sombre stadium dubstep (Chase \u0026amp Status’ Blind Faith, Now 78 Nero’s Guilt, Now 79). As Madonna and Britney Spears’ careers suddenly faded, a new heroine emerged from the world of country. There had been R\u0026ampBcountry crossovers before (Usher and Tim McGraw, Now 60) but adopting that internationalism made Taylor Swift (We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, Now 83) the biggest country act of all time. She even had Obama on her side, with the president calling Kanye West a “jackass” after he invaded her prize acceptance at the 2009 MTV Video Music awards.Foxes was an example of an emerging, less thrilling, 2010s British pop her Let Go for Tonight (Now 87) was perfectly fine, but it represented a shift to a rather blank, home counties sound, as if Tim Henman had been appointed pop tsar. Sam Smith, Jess Glynne, Tom Odell, Ellie Goulding, and tousle-haired jack of all trades Ed “Hello Dave” Sheeran – this was chart pop as a career, in the way insurance or banking used to be, with a professional distance and a pre-rock attitude. At least Foxes had a proper stage name. The charts were starting to become harder to read – in 2014, Oliver Heldens and Becky Hill’s Gecko (Overdrive) (Now 88) was the last UK No 1 to have made it on sales alone, as streaming became incorporated into the chart the following week. It was also becoming harder for outliers to break through, though Philip George’s Wish You Were Mine (Now 90) – deep house made in his bedroom – was an exception from a period when Robin S’s Show Me Love appeared to have been the most influential record ever made.And so we enter the very recent past, the era of Trump, and some exceptionally good but also exceptionally mopey R\u0026ampB. There was the new tough-but-weepy Bieber (Let Me Love You, Now 95), the Weeknd’s The Hills (Now 93) claimed “when I’m fucked up, that’s the real me”, while Drake bemoaned how “stressed out” he was as a Timmy Thomas sample played on Hotline Bling. Black British music had begun to dominate the second side of Nows (Stefflon Don’s Hurtin’ Me, Now 98 Dave’s No Words, Now 99). Indeed, the second disc of Now 99 was as exciting a sequence as Now had ever produced – Ramz, J Hus, B Young, Not3s, Mabel et al – at least until it weirdly petered out with Maroon 5, James Bay and U2.The rather conservative “greatest hits” choices on Now 100 are therefore all the more disappointing, but no matter – the pop continuum is what counts with Now.

Oh no. Anything but the personal questionIt was more than a year ago, during the general election campaign, that Theresa May last met a member of the public. A blessing for all concerned. The prime minister can’t do touchy-feely. She can barely manage basic personal interactions with her own cabinet, let alone with people she has never set eyes on.Yet for reasons best known to themselves, the prime minister’s minders decided the time was right to send her up to the north-east to explain in person why everyone was going to be a great deal more worse-off after Brexit. It was an idea that was as bold as it was misguided. Emotional intelligence is seemingly even harder to programme than artificial intelligence. And May is lacking in both. So what had been intended as a way of making the government seem more accessible achieved the exact opposite. Half an hour that no one present will ever get back. A black hole of existential ennui. Somewhat later than planned, May finally stepped out on to the shop floor of an engineering factory in Newcastle to take questions from a semicircle of employees who had been press-ganged into the event. Right from the off, she looked awkward, as if she was longing for the event to be over before it had even started. The body language of the audience, all crossed arms and vacant expressions, suggested the feeling was mutual.May did at least manage to identify where she was – an improvement on the morning when she had failed to realise she was in Gateshead – before going into her standard intro. It was great to be wherever she was and she looked forward to never coming back. With a bit of luck, Brexit was going to work out OK, but if it didn’t she wanted everyone to know she was only doing her best to deliver on the will of the people. So it was their fault.“Now it’s your turn to ask me some questions,” the prime minister mumbled anxiously. Nothing. Nada. For a moment it looked as if the audience had made an unconscious collective decision that the Q\u0026ampA would be cripplingly painful for everyone and had agreed to terminate it before it had even got under way. Eventually someone came up with a question. Something for which May looked pathetically grateful.Could she explain why the EU should bother to give us a deal when the Chequers agreement was the government so obviously trying to have its cake and eat it? A silent primal scream. Of course she couldn’t. “Um ... it will be good for the EU,” she said, struggling for language. Any language. Other than English. “What I see around the EU is that it will be good.” May nodded her head vigorously, desperately trying to recall the “How to engage with normal people” YouTube video she had watched on the train up. No one nodded back. Instead a few eyes closed in despair.Another long, embarrassing pause. Then another question. This time about a hard Brexit being damaging for the north-east. “We want to um ... ” May began, before switching to default full Maybot. “Er ... see this free-trade area we’ve been um ... talking about.” Her voice tailed off as she lost her train of thought. At least she was keeping her answers short and sweet. If incomprehensible. Better that than being honest about a Brexit she didn’t believe in.Yet again an agonising wait for the next question. An act of sadism from an audience who had clearly decided to at least have fun while their time was being wasted. “You’ve got the worst job in the world,” one person observed. “How do you relax?” Theresa panicked. Not the personal question. Anything but the personal question. Um ... She liked to go walking. Round in circles mainly. And she liked to do some cooking, because one of the great things about cooking was that you got to eat afterwards. Then you did the washing up. Or Philip did. And if you ran out of food you went out to the supermarket. Or sometimes the corner shop if that was more convenient.It was another wheat field moment. An insight into a world of quiet desperation. “I also er ... quite like watching,” she continued. “Has anyone else, um ... seen it? ... the American crime series NCIS.” The kiss of death. Immediately everyone present made a mental note to never watch the programme.There was just enough time for another protracted silence before the final question. What advice did she have for working women? “Believe in yourself,” she mumbled. Something she was clearly unable to do. “And show your skills.” She had done that bit at least. They just weren’t the skills that most people associated with a prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42ba4d898d3d7b17919ef542ae36100addc5d20/0_84_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd10432152b4ed4bac2b5ba5bcf4563e","title":"theresa may woos north east england with powerhouse talk","story":"Prime minister uses Gateshead trip to reaffirm commitment to promoting growth in northTheresa May has reaffirmed her plans to bolster the northern powerhouse as she kicked off a summer campaign intended to win support for her much-criticised Chequers plan for Brexit at home and abroad.The prime minister chaired a cabinet meeting in Gateshead on Monday before meeting factory workers for a rare town hall-style event, while her ministers fanned out across the region on a series of visits to businesses and public institutions.After initially appearing to lose interest in the northern powerhouse agenda when she first took over at Downing Street, she was said to have encouraged a renewed focus on the plan late last year to rebalance the UK’s economy.She confirmed that up to £780m was being set aside, from previously announced funding, for a pre-planned east coast mainline upgrade and that the “North of Tyne” devolution deal was to go ahead.One of the most important things the government could do for the north-east economy was to successfully establish a free trade area for goods with the EU, she said, as a frictionless border was particularly important to the car industry.She told workers: “The future post-Brexit is going to be what we make it. We want to get that good deal with the European Union, but we have huge benefits here in the UK, with our entrepreneurship, our innovation, our skillset, our workforces.“We can really take those opportunities and have that brighter future. Many people said that immediately after the referendum we would see a collapse in our economy. In fact, our economy has continued to grow.”May came under pressure over securing a Brexit deal after Jeremy Hunt, her new foreign secretary, said on a visit to Berlin that there was now a “very real threat” of ending up with no deal “by accident” because of stalling by EU negotiators.She claimed that EU partners were starting to focus on the detrimental impact to their own economies, some of which traded heavily with the UK, if they failed to reach agreement before the UK left in March next year.“What I see is people focusing their minds now on the impact the future relationship will have on their economies as well as ours,” she said. “We’ve had some constructive responses so far. I won’t say that you won’t hear some negative things being said. So we’re going to sit down and talk to people about it.”The prime minister sidestepped a question over what would happen if parliament rejected any agreement negotiated with the EU, although she confirmed ministers were stepping up preparations for a no-deal Brexit so they were prepared for all outcomes. “My aim is to bring forward a deal that parliament will support,” she said.Asked how she unwound from “the world’s most stressful job”, May told workers that she enjoyed walking, cooking and watching US television crime drama NCIS."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9beaadc95fbcdfed6562bb6335e82834863448/0_0_5940_3563/master/5940.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69961015325b5005e2e1897681e7d023","title":"ministers selling out uk exporters corbyn to say","story":"Labour leader to say lack of industrial plan means firms unable to profit from ‘competitive’ poundJeremy Corbyn will accuse the government on Tuesday of selling out manufacturers by failing to introduce an industrial plan that could have helped them make more of the weak pound since the Brexit referendum.The Labour leader will say that the British economy has become too reliant on imports, meaning that companies have been unable to benefit from the drop in the value of the pound against the euro and the dollar.Launching Labour’s campaign to boost manufacturing after Brexit, he is expected to say: “Our exporters should be able to take proper advantage of the one benefit to them that Brexit has already brought, a more competitive pound. “After the EU referendum result, the pound became more competitive and that should have helped our exporters. But they are being sold out by a lack of a Conservative government industrial plan, which has left our economy far too reliant on imports.”His remarks follow a Labour awayday in central London on Monday, where shadow cabinet members presented plans for a populist leftwing legislative programme so the party is ready for a snap general election.With the UK’s industrial base in decline for years, however, including under the last Labour government, Corbyn’s criticism – and his regret that companies could not make more of the weak pound – is likely to be met with scepticism.In his speech to industry chiefs in Birmingham, he will tell manufacturers that Labour’s policies would drive an industrial renaissance, using public contracts to expand the country’s economic base, secure good jobs and drive up tax revenues. He will urge Theresa May to reconsider the option of negotiating a new customs union, even though such a move was narrowly rejected by the Commons last week. “It’s a matter of practical common sense,” he will say.Sir Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, told shadow ministers at the awayday that they could face a difficult first parliament if elected as a minority government in a snap election.Sources said he talked about the challenges of driving through an agenda and working with the civil service were Labour to find itself in minority government. “Some people are concerned they could act as a block,” one source said.The all-day session took place just yards from parliament, meeting in Transport House, the former Labour HQ, which now houses the Local Government Association. The shadow frontbench was told to come armed with proposals for a draft Queen’s speech, a first budget and legislative ideas to  a five-year parliament that would be easy to sell if Labour found itself in minority government.No general election is scheduled until 2022, but Labour has taken the lead in the polls recently, which critics have attributed to May’s Chequers plan for the Brexit negotiations and a series of cabinet and frontbench resignations. The party has already hired dozens of local community organisers to help with election planning and selected more than 80 candidates for marginal seats, including the director of the Class thinktank, Faiza Shaheen, who will take on Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Woodford Green.Other target seats where Labour has already selected candidates include the former home secretary Amber Rudd’s Hastings and Rye seat, the 1922 Committee chair Graham Brady’s seat of Altrincham and Sale West and the seats of the prominent Tory remainers Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70320ed25b27611b11d4812aba12212b551c4e27/0_253_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2ca9d2551ab61038ab36868442a74fe","title":"theresa may to end pay cap by forcing departments to make savings","story":"The planned new wage increases have come from departmental savings, rather than the Treasury releasing new funds, according to the Sun newspaper.

He added: “I know it sounds like a harsh penalty for something unintentional and where I didn’t put anything prohibited in my body, but a rule is a rule and I accept that there is a technical violation. I am hopeful other athletes will learn from my mistake and be mindful of this rule, as well as others.”Lochte said he took the IV containing B12 and other vitamins available over the counter because his wife and son had been sick and he sought a preventative boost for his immune system.Usada said the ban is retroactive to 24 May, which was the day he posted the photo, and will run through June 2019, ruling him out of the next two major international meets: August’s Pan Pacific Championships and the 2019 World Championships in Gwangju, South Korea. The punishment would appear to cast doubt on his stated goal of making the US team for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, during which Lochte will turn 36.Lochte will also be withdrawn from the four events he’d entered at the US national championships, which begin Wednesday in Irvine, California. “I’ve been swimming my whole life and I’ve been monitored by Usada for my entire competitive career,” he said. “I have never taken a prohibited substance. I have never attempted to gain any advantage over my competition by putting anything illegal in my body. I would never do that. This is very serious to me. I would never intentionally violate any anti-doping rule.“Unfortunately, although the rule is a newer rule and is not as widely known as others, I should know better.”USA Swimming and Lochte’s agent did not immediately respond to separate requests for comment from the .“I may be on the sideline for competition, but I will continue to train every day (for) the opportunity to represent the USA again,” Lochte said. “I want nothing more than to earn the privilege to swim for my country in my fifth Olympics at Tokyo 2020.”The sanction marks the second extended suspension in two years for Lochte, who previously served a 10-month ban and was made to forfeit $100,000 in bonus money that went with his gold medal at the 2016 Olympics for his role in vandalizing a gas station in Brazil with three other US swimmers during a drunken night out at the Rio Games following the completion of the swimming programme.The embarrassing fallout stemming from Lochte’s attempted cover-up story of a ‘robbery’ came to overshadow the final week of the Olympics and cost him four sponsorships, including deals with Speedo and Ralph Lauren. Additionally, Lochte faced charges of falsely communicating a crime to authorities, but an appellate court in Brazil ultimately dismissed the criminal case nearly 11 months after the incident took place.Lochte becomes the second American swimmer to be hit with a lengthy ban during the run-up to US nationals after former University of Texas star Madisyn Cox, an inidual medley specialist who captured a gold and a bronze medal at last year’s world championships, was suspended for two years last week after testing positive for the banned stimulant trimetazidine by Fina, the sport’s world governing body."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16d4cd7ec9b9c0bb090c6175550033f35879ecfe/0_228_3366_2020/master/3366.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd8ff026c9d098163dfb62c55e6b53ba","title":"yorkshire jonny bairstow weighs in pressure lancashire","story":"Jonny Bairstow’s combative 82 has been the standout contribution with the bat in a so far bowler-friendly Roses match, in which Lancashire are chasing an highly unlikely 323. The England wicketkeeper-batsman put a first‑innings golden duck out of\u0026nbsphis mind to help Yorkshire recover\u0026nbspfrom 21 for three in their second innings, having lost the Test captains Joe Root and Kane Williamson cheaply. He then watched on as his bowlers struck six times, including Root getting Jos Buttler.Bairstow’s 67-ball effort looks set to contribute to a crucial White Rose win given the hosts reached the close at 194 for six. A Yorkshire win would be their third from eight matches and give them breathing space from Lancashire, who are heading towards their fifth defeat from nine.Lancashire are without their captain, Liam Livingstone, after he sustained a fractured left thumb fielding on day one and he will surely bat in desperation only. Conditions – swing and some nip and turn – have suited bowlers, meaning the Red Rose side face a mountainous task to salvage victory.Root was trapped lbw for three by a beauty from his England colleague Jimmy Anderson as he was caught in two minds to play forward or back against a delivery short of a length. Graham Onions also had Adam Lyth and Williamson caught behind by Dane Vilas. Williamson, who had a first‑innings golden duck as part of Jordan Clark’s hat-trick, added a single and this was the New Zealand captain’s lowest return in a first-class match in which he has batted twice.Bairstow, dropped on 22 at mid-on by Matthew Parkinson, reached 50 off 38 balls and shared 133 inside 20 overs for the fourth wicket with the promising teenage opener Harry Brook (55) before he was the first of six afternoon wickets as Yorkshire slipped from 160 for four. Onions finished with three wickets.Although Lancashire started their chase with a half-century partnership between Keaton Jennings (30) and Alex Davies (32), they fell lbw in quick succession as the score reached 87 for three. The Warwickshire leg-spinner Josh Poysden, signed on a single-match loan, also trapped Dane Vilas in front before the home middle order slipped, including two wickets in an over for the seamer Steve Patterson.Buttler, who hit 59, and Tom Bailey then shared 80, with the former reaching 50 off 54 balls with a pulled six before falling in the penultimate over caught at leg slip trying to sweep Root’s fifth ball.Elsewhere in Division One the leaders, Surrey, claimed a first‑innings lead of 382 against their fellow challengers Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge thanks to centuries from Rory Burns (153) and Rikki Clarke (111). Stuart Broad claimed two wickets in 19 overs. Notts closed on 57 for one second time around.Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan shared 13 wickets with the pink ball as Sussex beat Glamorgan inside two days at Hove. Ben Stokes (five for 52) completed his first five-wicket haul in county cricket for four years for Durham against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham before falling for three.

In it, the manager described the payments as essential to Tesla’s operation. The leak came soon after Tesla announced it was cutting several thousand jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs. Tesla has been burning through cash at a rate of about $1bn a quarter, or more than $7,430 every minute, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and finished the first quarter with $2.7bn in cash on hand.The company’s rapidly weakening cash position has spooked investors, and comes despite the claims of founder Elon Musk that Tesla is now a “real” carmaker after hitting a weekly goal of producing more than 5,000 mass-market Model 3s, the rate of production that the manufacturer hopes will turn the company’s economic position around.The company has asked for an undisclosed rebate on money it has spent on 10 suppliers since 2016.After the memo was leaked over the weekend, Musk tweeted: “Only costs that actually apply to Q3 \u0026amp beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.”In a statement released on Monday, Tesla added: “Negotiation is a standard part of the procurement process, and now that we’re in a stronger position with Model 3 production ramping, it is a good time to improve our competitive advantage in this area.”Still, industry analysts said it is unusual for automakers to request refunds for two previous years, as Tesla has demanded. “This is troubling for us to hear,” said Morningstar analyst David Whiston in a note to clients.The leak comes as Musk continues to unnerve investors, with Tesla shares falling from a year high of $370 in mid June to around $301 on Monday. An analyst at Baillie Gifford, Tesla’s third-largest institutional shareholder, told the Journal the firm is “ided” on whether Musk is the right leader for Tesla.The latest bad news came after the entrepreneur got into a confrontation with Vernon Unsworth, a British cave er who helped rescue a team of Thai soccer players from a system of flooded caves. Musk launched a personal attack on the rescue worker after Unsworth questioned the usefulness of a mini-submarine Musk offered help in the rescue. Musk was ultimately forced to apologise.In early May, Musk cut off a Morgan Stanley analyst who had asked if the company should raise more capital while it could even if it did not need it. Musk responded that he “specifically” did not want to, and called the analyst’s questions “so dry. They’re killing me.”As a possible crunch for Tesla approaches, Musk has said he has personally taken control of production and that he was sleeping occasionally at the factory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7240c0a2385b47be309fc4328d24400d3842846/0_195_5988_3593/master/5988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92c6d7c5502a6d1e517881f3160192bd","title":"netflix dark tourist extreme travel tv ross kemp vice","story":"David Farrier’s series follows in the footsteps of Ross Kemp and Vice by making titillating television from war zones and disaster sites. It’s shallow and sordidOne of the most unpleasant rumours I can recall emerging from the Balkan wars of the 1990s was of a German agency who organised trips for tourists to “visit” the conflict and even participate. There’s nothing quite so appalling as that in David “Tickled” Farrier’s new Netflix series Dark Tourist, although it does venture into the grotesquely bizarre. He looks at the trend for Nuclear Tourism, for example, in which people flock to soak up the radiation left behind following the disaster in Fukushima, as well as the tourist industry that has built up around the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. He also visits locations in Africa and South America associated with death and destruction that some tourists find somehow attractive, a shameful attraction the makers of Dark Tourist assume is shared to a degree by the viewer.Although there are strong hints of Louis Theroux in Farrier’s chin-scratching demeanour, overall the series is part of a recent trend for making titillating TV from the world’s troublespots. Its soundtrack and graphics fit the bill: pummelling, Wagnerian motifs knocking you back like Tequila slammers, bursts of brutal fast cuts. It feels a little sordid, as if the miseries of the world are mere fodder for some televisual equivalent of the thrills of extreme mountain biking. On the other hand, you feel a bit chastened in your armchair watching Farrier enduring privations such as a voodoo ritual or narco tours in Pablo Escobar’s old neighbourhood.From The Misadventures Of Romesh Ranganathan to the range of documentaries produced by Vice (Uganda’s Moonshine Epidemic, The Cannibal Warlords Of Liberia, Nigeria’s Oil Pirates: The Curse Of Oil), there is a deep ambivalence about this particular strain of television. It’s educational, for sure, and takes some courage to produce but seems more interested in wallowing in the colourful weirdness of strife, as well as the ballsiness and endurance of facing up to it first hand, rather than offering any sort of political analysis or possible solution.A particularly egregious example, it always seemed, was Ross Kemp’s Extreme World featuring the former EastEnders hardman looking suitably engorged, challenging the world’s troublespots to come and have a go if they thought were hard enough. The credits were especially risible, bringing to mind Alan Partridge sitting on the toilet reading Andy McNab’s Bravo Two Zero. Once you got past the posturing and the “I was warned by the locals not to venture here but I’m a Mitchell brother, no one tells me where not to go”, he did actually succeed in exposing viewers to some bleak and brutal truths. In one episode, for instance, he investigated the phenomenon of sex trafficking in India, with thousands of girls abducted from country villages to big city brothels every year. He spoke to both the traffickers and to outraged villagers who were taking matters into their own hands. After all that initial posturing, you felt that Kemp himself shared a feeling of impotence in the face of such chronic evil, while the community response offered a sobering and genuinely strong measure of hope.Meanwhile, in Misadventures, when comedian Ranganathan visits Port-Au-Prince in Haiti, he has a moment of genuine doubt as to what he is doing there. The whole conceit of his stepping bravely out of his comfort zone (a motif of Dark Tourist also) suddenly seems cripplingly irrelevant in the face of the urban despair, while the wry, sidelong glance at the bonkers-ness of it all feels utterly inappropriate, too. “I’m not sure we should be filming here,” he says.Perhaps the master of this mode of television was Anthony Bourdain. In his series Parts Unknown, you never felt like you were being targeted by some amorally tumescent programme commissioner, seeking out macho thrills at the expense of the locals. When visiting Burma, for instance, he revealed its people not as global eccentrics, gun-toting desperadoes or basket cases for our entertainment but as human beings, conversing with them sympathetically, and inviting them to express themselves not through the varied and yet universal language of cuisine.

I let him buy a large plastic box from the Container Store, I let him organize the boxes of medication and syringes and alcohol pads. He stacks the drugs that need to be kept cool in the fridge, next to the yogurt. When the time comes for the first injection, I am too afraid, and ask him to do it. E is kind enough to accept the job without mentioning my change of heart.This is the plan for my egg retrieval cycle: each evening E injects me in the stomach with two drugs. They pause my normal menstrual cycle and stimulate my ovaries to grow multiple egg-containing follicles to maturity. In the morning, I go to the hospital before work along with dozens of other women who are also having egg retrievals, some for IVF, like me. Some to freeze unfertilized eggs for future use. At the hospital the other women and I have blood drawn, to check our hormone levels, and we have transvaginal ultrasounds, to count the number of egg-containing follicles that are growing in our ovaries. The ultrasounds are invasive, but by the fifth or sixth day become routine. I ignore the feeling and scrutinize the screen as if I’m an aspirant sonographer. The doctors doing the ultrasounds take screenshots of the follicles. Each morning I feel like the count is not high enough, although I also don’t know exactly how many I should be aiming for. “You just need one” is something that people write in IVF forums online, to be encouraging. It’s technically true, but statistically unlikely.The benefit of having treatment in a large teaching hospital is access to great doctors and cutting-edge research. The drawback of having treatment in a large teaching hospital is that it is very crowded. One weekend morning I find that there is nowhere to sit in the waiting room because so many chairs are being occupied not just by the women who are being treated, but by their male partners who have accompanied them. I regard the men with rage while I, and several other women, lean against the wall. I text E, who is not there, because the hospital is an hour-long subway ride from where we live. It had not occurred to me that he should come along. If you were here, I write, you would not have a chair! I would not allow it!Of course not, he replies.The hormones are making me moody.They are also making me doughy. My jeans no longer fit comfortably and when I get home from the office in the evening I lie on the sofa and watch Sex and the City until 9.30, when E draws the drugs into the syringes and injects me again. A third drug is added, to stop me from ovulating too soon. I feel like a pallid, slow version of my former self. I can’t exercise, in case my swollen ovaries twist. I don’t want to see friends or go out to dinner or walk the dog.I go to an additional appointment to the doctor, a standard procedure to check my uterus for obstructions that could make it hard for me to get pregnant. Take some ibuprofen afterwards, the doctor advises, and I do, and I go to my office and am overcome an hour later by cramping so excruciating I assume this must be what it feels like to go into labor.After 10 days the follicles are large enough for the eggs to be retrieved. It is time for the trigger shot, which ripens all of the follicles at once so that they’re ready. E and I brace ourselves and he stabs the large needle into the flesh of my bum at the appointed time. It’s an act of love.Isn’t it funny, I say, that some people have sex to have children! We laugh.Thirty-six hours later, we return to the hospital for the retrieval. I will go under twilight anesthesia so that a doctor can pull the eggs out of my ovaries with another big needle. E will go into a small room with pornography to produce a semen sample. Our respective products will be combined by someone in a lab, to try to make embryos.The man in the queue for the small room behind E has the same first name as him. I hope they don’t mix your sperm up with Other E’s, I whisper to E.We’ll never know, he whispers back, that guy also looks like a Jew from New Jersey.Five days later we have the results. Eleven eggs were retrieved. But only two of them survive until the fifth day, which is how long they have to grow before they can be biopsied for the genetic testing, which is the whole reason we’re doing IVF in the first place.I’m sorry, the doctor says, when we have a call to discuss it. You can do another round next month.OK, I say. Yes.This week I learned: it’s not uncommon for numbers of potential embryos to drop by at least half from egg retrieval to fertilization, and the same again from fertilization to day five.

Having now revealed her identity, she tells how she was forced to marry into the mafiaSipping a cappuccino in a cafe on Sicily’s Palermo docks, a woman is recalling a dramatic exchange with her daughter. A year ago, she explains, the 16-year-old had gone up to the attic of their home and opened a big dusty box that lay in the corner. Her parents had always forbidden her from entering the attic, or opening the box, but now the girl was determined to disobey them. Inside were about 10 packages, each inidually wrapped. They were paintings: landscapes, the sea, olive groves, the deep south. All were signed with the same name: Piera Aiello.Her mother entered the attic. “I painted them,” she said. “They’re beautiful,” her daughter replied. “But Mamma, if these paintings are yours, why are they signed by a different name? Who is Piera Aiello?”With tears in her eyes, her mother asked her daughter to sit down. “I am Piera Aiello,” she said. “It’s time I told you who I really am.”A tall woman with dark eyes and black hair, Aiello smiles and gesticulates wildly as she tells her story. Not far away, three armed police guards survey the surroundings, making sure no one gets too close. “My daughter’s curiosity in that attic was one among the many turning points in my life,” she says. “I told her to listen and I started from the beginning, a thousand miles away from that attic, in Sicily, where it all began.”Aiello was born in Partanna, a small village in western Sicily. Her father was a bricklayer, her mother a tailor. “My parents never let me want for anything. It was the best time of my life, by far. But, as they say, it was just the calm before the storm.”That storm arrived when Aiello was 14 and met a boy named Nicolò Atria. She didn’t know Nicolò was the son of Vito Atria, the local mafia boss. The godfather approved of Nicolò’s relationship with Aiello, not with a blessing but an order: Don Vito had decided that Aiello would marry his son. “Nicolò and I had had an argument, I don’t remember why. Don Vito came to my house. He asked my father if he could speak to me in private. He said: ‘You’re young. Take a few days to think it over. But in any case, you and Nicolò will soon be married. I know you love your family very much.” Aiello understood the veiled threat. “My future father-in-law had warned me that if I didn’t marry his son, he’d kill my mother and father. I couldn’t allow that to happen.”On 9 November 1985, in the tiny baroque church of Madonna delle Grazie in Partanna, Aiello became Nicolò’s wife. She was 18. Neither could have questioned Don Vito’s authority. Nicolò, too, was obliged to follow his father’s will and marry a girl he didn’t love. Back then, in Sicily, it often took much less to get killed a glance toward the wrong person, an unreciprocated greeting, was enough. “Once I saw Don Vito throw his wife in the pool because she had ‘humiliated him’ by throwing on the ground an ice-cream he had offered her. My mother-in-law didn’t know how to swim. Don Vito watched impassive from the poolside as she began to drown. Nicolò saved her from certain death. I’ll let you imagine what could have happened had I decided not to marry his son,” says Aiello.Don Vito was a traditional mafioso, bound to a ruthless code of honour. “I once asked Don Vito if it was true what people said about him around town, that he was the head of the Partanna mafia. He looked at me and laughed. He said he was someone whom ‘people came to when they needed to resolve a problem, like to find a stolen tractor or a job for a son’.”Nine days after Aiello’s wedding, he was murdered in the vineyards around Partanna. The illicit interests of the Sicilian mafia were changing. Heroin was flooding the streets of Italy and the new bosses decided to remove anyone in the older generation who refused to invest in the business. “That same day, in the mortuary in Partanna, in front of his father’s corpse, Nicolò swore that he would avenge his father’s death,” Aiello says. “He swore that he would kill the men who murdered his father.”Aiello spent her days making sweets in a pizzeria and cafe owned by Nicolò. Business was good, because people continued to respect “Don Vito Atria’s son”. “We used to take in a million lire a day,” Aiello recalls. Their life at home was less successful. She did not love Nicolò, who, in turn, beat her. Aiello began taking the pill. Nicolò’s desire to have a male heir weighed heavily on her, but she didn’t want to bear his child.“One day he forced me to see a doctor. When he learned that I had been taking the pill, he beat me for a week straight. Then he raped me.”Two years after Don Vito’s death, Aiello was pregnant. Nicolò hoped for a boy and said that he would name him Vito to honour his father. Aiello hoped against hope that she was not carrying a boy, who might become a boss like his father, or, even worse, like his grandfather.Being pregnant focused Aiello’s sense of rebellion against the criminal and chauvinistic culture in which she was trapped. “During the pregnancy, I decided to take the state exam to become a police officer. When Nicolò found out, he started beating me, as he’d always done. I never gave up. My resistance to every slap, kick or insult was my way of fighting Cosa Nostra.”Aiello never became a police officer. She didn’t pass the exam. But she did give birth to a girl she named Vita, or “Life”.Nicolò cared for his daughter like he had never cared for anyone before. On the rare occasions he cooked, it was for her that he made the best pizzas. The last one was in the shape of a heart. Aiello took it to Vita on the evening of 24 June 1991. “That same night, as soon as I’d entered the kitchen, I heard a scream from the front door. It happened so quickly. The curtains moved suddenly and I saw the shadows of two armed and hooded men.”Nicolò had kept his promise to avenge his father’s death. He had spoken about it with his men. And the mafia decided that he, too, should die. They shot him in the head, the arm and the abdomen, a ferocious volley of bullets from a sawn-off shotgun, the typical weapon used in mafia executions.Aiello tried to disarm the killers, but they grabbed her by the hair and threw her to the ground. When they left, Nicolò was already dead. The coroners removed more than 3lb (1.4kg) of ammunition from his gut.“My face was covered in my husband’s blood. I despised Nicolò, but I felt pity for him. He was just a boy, 27 years old, and they killed him like an animal.”One week after her husband’s murder, Aiello met district attorney Paolo Borsellino, who, with Giovanni Falcone, had recently carried out an investigation against the Sicilian mafia that resulted in hundreds of arrests. A strong friendship developed between Aiello and Borsellino. Aiello called him “Uncle Paolo” and he looked after her. He offered her an armed guard, found her a safe city to hide in, and helped her to leave Sicily. Rita Atria, Nicolò’s sister, went with her.Rita was 16, full of life, strong and sure of herself. Aiello had looked after her since she was a young girl. She knew that Rita’s choice would be even more difficult than her own. After all, she was Don Vito’s daughter. Rita had a blood relation within that mafia family. Her rebellion would have left a scar on the mafia’s code of honour that no vendetta could have set right.“We’d spend our days in police stations. Borsellino would often come and see us. We were afraid. We knew that the bosses were already plotting our deaths.“One day, after yet another interrogation, I ran out of the room in tears. Borsellino came out to hug me. I confessed that I was afraid of dying. He told me: ‘Nothing will happen to you.’ Smiling, he added: ‘I will certainly die before you.’”A few months later, in Palermo, on 19 July 1992, the mafia assassinated Borsellino with a car bomb in Via D’Amelio. Two months earlier, on 23 May, the same fate had struck Falcone, assassinated with 300kg of explosives on the motorway between Punta Raisi airport and Palermo. Today, Palermo International Airport is named after them the 13 November 2006 issue of Time Magazine listed them among the greatest heroes of the past 60 years.Aiello was desperate, Rita even more so. The mafia had killed her father, brother and now Borsellino, the man who had become her sole confidant. One week later, on 26 July 1992, Rita jumped off the seventh floor of an apartment building and killed herself.“I was devastated,” says Aiello. “I felt as if Rita had abandoned me. I felt I had the responsibility to carry on her rebellion, too. Only later did I realise that Rita’s gesture was that of a girl who had lost everything.”Rita’s and Aiello’s testimonies led to the arrest of dozens of mafiosi in the provinces of Agrigento and Trapani. Nicolò’s mother and Don Vito’s widow, Giovanna, never forgave her daughter and one day even set out to destroy her daughter’s tombstone with a hammer. “My mother-in-law hated both of us. She hoped they’d kill us. Our decision to become police informants was dishonourable to her. I never despised her. Both of us had been forced to marry men that we didn’t love. She had been raped by her father and never knew the meaning of true love. She was a victim of the mafia culture she grew up in.”Aiello made a new life for herself in northern Italy. She changed her name to Paola and started working as a babysitter. In her spare time, she painted. After a few years, she fell in love. Up to that moment her life had been conditioned by others the mafia chose her husband, the Italian state her new life. The time had come for her to make her own decisions, but there was one problem: “This man knew nothing about me. One evening, I invited him to dinner, and after our meal I asked him to sit down and listen to me.”Aiello told him about Nicolò, Don Vito, Borsellino and Rita. After, he asked her to marry him and they were wed on 8 August 2000. The priest was Don Ciotti, an anti-mafia activist living under police escort. Her witness was Salvatore Borsellino, Paolo’s brother, and among the guests were magistrates and members of the police force engaged in the struggle against the mafia.Her new husband promised to keep Aiello’s secret even from their two daughters. She worked as a babysitter until they were born, then settled into life as a housewife. Once in a while, the police asked her to give speeches in schools, or at events organised by anti-mafia associations. She would do so anonymously, covering her face. Until that fateful afternoon in the attic.“That evening we all gathered in the living room. A few weeks earlier I had been contacted by politicians from the Five Star Movement, who asked me to run for parliament in the upcoming elections. I wasn’t convinced, but my daughter persuaded me. She said that after everything I had been through, this was an important opportunity to bring my experience to parliament.”Aiello began an electoral campaign but, unlike other candidates, she could not show her face, have her photograph taken, or hold public rallies. She was still under police protection, and the authorities were still responsible for her safety. Because she covered her face with a veil or a scarf, she became known as the “faceless candidate”.In March, Aiello was elected to parliament. Most of her votes came from Trapani, and she “was very happy, because Trapani is the last stronghold of the Sicilian mafia, the kingdom of Matteo Messina Denaro, who is still at large”. They also came from all quarters of society – doctors, lawyers, workers, farmers, young and old.“I chose this party because it was the only one that would allow me to express myself freely,” she says. Under police protection, she had realised that police informants are often abandoned by the state after their information has been used. This will be the focus of her agenda in parliament, she says, a decision that has made her an even greater target for the mafia – making the lives of informants better means encouraging people to rebel. The election was not, however, conclusive, and in the tricky days following, the Five Star Movement had to form a controversial and difficult alliance with the Lega, a xenophobic party led by Matteo Salvini, a controversial senator who is now the minister of the interior. One of his first acts was to close Italian seaports to the Aquarius, a ship carrying 629 rescued migrants. Aiello doesn’t conceal her disapproval of Salvini’s choices: “He should talk less. Italy cannot reject immigrants. We must improve the services made available to them once they arrive.”On 13 June, after her election, and 27 years after she first went into hiding, Aiello decided that she had had enough. “I was tired of covering my face,” she says. “In addition to this, the law allows state witnesses to show their faces once they are elected. Cameras were all around in the parliament anyway. So I said: ‘Why not?’” Her assistant got in touch with the , and she gave this paper the first photograph. She chose the day she first landed in Sicily as an MP. “I wanted it to happen in Sicily,” she says, “where everything began.” Once in front of the camera, “I was really embarassed and timid. But it was like coming back to life. That day, in the attic, when my daughter discovered my paintings, my life changed. I, Piera Aiello, have returned and will no longer hide myself in the attic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa32beada49beb13c4fab30bc4f6a21bd373d583/0_0_3510_2106/master/3510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373c692481f3c327b5195245851e4622","title":"ozils resignation sparks recriminations across german politics","story":"Turkish-German footballer’s resignation from national team leads to arguments over integration and racismAngela Merkel has insisted that Germany is “a cosmopolitan country” and praised Mesut Özil’s achievements for the national side, after the Arsenal midfielder’s resignation from the German national team over alleged racism and lack of respect kicked football deep into the country’s political arena.“Özil is a great footballer who has done a lot for the national football team,” a spokesperson for the German chancellor said on Monday, adding that the Gelsenkirchen-born player’s decision to resign “has to be respected”.The World Cup winner’s combative resignation statement on Sunday led some politicians to decry him as an example of the “failed integration” of migrants from Muslim cultures, while others warned that Özil’s acrimonious parting with German football sent a disastrous signal to the next generation of Germans with multiethnic backgrounds.The German player, of Turkish descent, had been widely criticised in the run-up to this summer’s World Cup after he posed for photographs alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in London. His critics said the smouldering conflict had contributed to his team’s poor performance in Russia, with calls for the player, capped 92 times for Germany, to explain himself.But when Özil finally did so on Sunday, via a series of well-orchestrated and carefully phrased statements on social media, he took aim at some of his most vocal critics.Reinhard Grindel, the president of Germany’s football association, DFB, in particular stands accused of having scapegoated a player with a migrant background for his association’s collective failings. “In the eyes of Grindel and his supporters, I am German when we win but I am an immigrant when we lose,” Özil’s statement said.The German FA on Monday vehemently rejected accusations of racism, saying: “The DFB regrets the departure of Mesut Özil from the national team. However, this does not change the determination of the association to continue the successful integration work consistently and with deep conviction.” But the governing body finds itself engulfed in a scandal just six weeks before Uefa will rule on its bid to host Euro 2024. Germany’s only competitor for the tournament? Turkey.If the fallout from Özil’s resignation also has deep political reverberations in Germany, it is not only because Grindel is a former MP for Angela Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union, but also because under Merkel the Arsenal midfielder has been built up as the poster boy for the country’s state-led approach to integrating ethnic minorities.In her 18 years at the top of the CDU, she has never sought to challenge her party’s sceptical view of multiculturalism as a dangerously laissez-faire Anglo-Saxon approach to the challenges of multi-ethnic societies. In spite of Merkel’s staunch defence of open borders during the 2015 refugee crisis, the chancellor reiterated in the same year her party’s line that “multiculturalism leads to parallel societies, and therefore multiculturalism remains a grand delusion”.A comment piece in influential weekly Die Zeit in the wake of the footballer’s resignation from the national team argued: “In Özil, we are also losing faith in a progressive society.” The piece continued: “His withdrawal is a fatal symbol in a time and a country in which rightwing parties are getting ever louder and people on town squares call for refugees to drown in the sea.”Alice Weidel, co-leader of far-right Alternative für Deutschland, on Monday criticised Özil as “a typical example of the failed integration of far too many immigrants from Turkish Muslim cultural circles”.Politicians closer to the centre of the political spectrum said Özil’s combative resignation statement had still not fully explained why he had agreed to take part in a photoshoot that amounted to a propaganda coup for a Turkish strongman president then shaping up for reelection.“No one with a sensible mind wants Mesut Özil to deny his heritage,” said Paul Ziemiak, the head of the CDU’s youth organisation. “But to claim that a photo with Erdoğan – in the middle of Turkish elections – came about without political intentions is naive.”Turkish politicians were quick to endorse the footballer’s resignation as a goal for their own side, with sport minister Mehmet Kasapoğlu tweeting: “We support the honourable attitude of our brother Mesut Özil.”Cem Özdemir, a Green MP of Turkish heritage who is one of Germany’s most vocal critics of Erdoğan’s government, nonetheless said the footballer’s resignation sent out a troubling message, adding: “It is fatal when young German-Turks now get the impression that there isn’t a place for them in the German national side. Strength lies in ersity, not homogeneity. That’s how we won the World Cup in 2014, and France did this year.”Social Democrat justice minister Katarina Barley, who holds dual German and British citizenship, said: “It is an alarming sign when a great German footballer like Mesut Özil is no longer wanted in his country because of racism and doesn’t feel represented by the DFB.”Sawsan Chebli, a state secretary of Palestinian descent in the Berlin state parliament, tweeted: “Özil’s departure is a confession of failure for our country. Will we ever belong? My doubts are growing by the day. Am I allowed to say that as a state secretary? It is, at any rate, what I feel. And it hurts.Germany’s foreign minister on Monday rejected the accusation that the latest chapter in the Özil saga should be read as a verdict on the country’s approach to integration as a whole. “I don’t believe that the case of a multimillionaire living and working in England will give us any information on capacity to integrate in Germany,” said Heiko Maas, during a press conference with the visiting British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt.“Anyway, what matters is what happens on the pitch. That the Germans got kicked out at such an early stage has very little to do with the fact that Mr Özil allowed himself to be photographed with Mr Erdoğan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f76a252eb4cf58454f371f3f6b0c28fbb01016/0_89_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dc0031325852dc1ccf5ab5e5b366474","title":"north korea satellite images show dismantling of missile test facilities report","story":"Work seen as ‘significant confidence building measure’ after denuclearisation pledge made at summit with Donald TrumpSatellite images indicate North Korea has begun dismantling key facilities at a site used to develop engines for ballistic missiles, in a first step toward fulfilling a pledge made to US President Donald Trump at a June summit, reports a Washington-based think tank. The images from 20 July showed work at the Sohae satellite launching station to dismantle a building used to assemble space-launch vehicles and a nearby rocket engine test stand used to develop liquid-fuel engines for ballistic missiles and space-launch vehicles, the 38 North think tank said. “Since these facilities are believed to have played an important role in the development of technologies for the North’s intercontinental ballistic missile program, these efforts represent a significant confidence-building measure on the part of North Korea,” it said in a report. Trump told a news conference after his 12 June summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that Kim had promised that a major missile engine testing site would be destroyed very soon. Trump did not identify the site, but a US official subsequently told Reuters that it was Sohae. The 38 North report comes amid growing questions about North Korea’s willingness to live up to the commitments Kim made at the summit, particularly to work towards denuclearisation. US officials have repeatedly said North Korea has committed to giving up a nuclear weapons program that now threatens the United States, but Pyongyang has offered no details as to how it might go about this. Jenny Town, managing editor of 38 North, which is based at Washington’s Stimson Center, said the work at Sohae could be an important move to keep negotiations going. “This could (and that’s a big could) mean that North Korea is also willing to forgo satellite launches for the time being as well as nuclear and missile tests. This distinction has derailed diplomacy in the past,” she said. On Friday, senior US officials called on Kim to act on his promise to give up his nuclear weapons and said the world, including China and Russia, must continue to enforce sanctions on Pyongyang until he does so.A report in The Washington Post said that in spite of positive assessments Trump has given on progress with North Korea, he has vented anger at aides over a lack of immediate progress. In a tweet on Monday, Trump called this report “fake news”. Last week, Trump said there was “no rush” and “no time limit” on denuclearisation negotiations.Dan Coats, US director of national intelligence, said on Thursday it was technically possible for North Korea to eliminate its nuclear weapons program within a year, but added that it was not likely to happen.

Photograph: iStockMinority faith schools will not be allowed to rank children on the basis of how often they attend church services in their admission policies, under new laws due to come into force next year.The use of “parochial engagement” in prioritising school admissions has sparked controversy following the resignation of a Church of Ireland primary school principal last week.Principal Eileen Jackson resigned from St Patrick’s National School in Greystones, Co Wicklow, on the basis that the school was making admission to State-funded education a “collateral benefit” of involvement in the parish.The Department of Education has confirmed minority faith schools will continue to be permitted to give priority enrolment to children on the basis of religion under new admission laws.However, a spokesman said schools will not be permitted to rank these students “on the basis of the extent to which the child or his or her family are involved in local religious activities”.The measures are contained in the School Admissions Act, which was signed into law last week. It is due to come into force for children starting school in the 2019-2020 academic year.The Act provides for parents to give evidence – such as a baptismal certificate – of the child’s membership of a minority religion. The school will be allowed to take account of this only.The new Act removes the “baptism barrier” for Catholic schools – which account for 90 per cent of primary schools – by banning religion as a factor in school entry.Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the move was to ensure parents do not feel pressured to baptise their children to get access to local schools.An exception was made for minority faiths schools to ensure children of that religion can still access a school of their faith.The chairman of the board of management at St Patrick’s National School in Greystones , meanwhile, has insisted the school is “erse and inclusive”.Its admissions policy states that priority access is given to children who are “accustomed members” of the Church of Ireland parish of Greystones.Admissions on this basis require the signature of the rector, who signs off whether the child is an active member of the parish.It is understood that there are number of cases where local children baptised into the Church of Ireland were not given priority enrolment on the basis that they were not active members of the parish.Rev David Mungavin, chairman of the school’s board of management, said the school was not “going in any new direction and has no plans to do so”.In a letter to staff and parents on Monday, he stated that there “have been no changes to the ethos of the school and there are no plans for changes.“There have been no changes to the admissions policy for the school and there are no plans for changes.“St Patrick’s National School has and will remain a erse and inclusive school under Church of Ireland management.”He said Ms Jackson’s resignation last Friday came as a surprise to him and the board.Another source of controversy at the school involved a decision by the board of management to turn down an extra teacher the school was entitled to for the coming academic year.Some parents claim the move was to prevent school numbers growing and potentially diluting its Church of Ireland ethos.However, an education source said the board of management’s concerns focused on whether the school had the space to cope with extra pupil numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"We Are Church Ireland supports LGBTQI rights, but received no response to applicationHousing scheme rebranded but development in Inchicore still just a glint in Minister\u0026rsquos eyeEx-Labour party politician says democratic forces must realign to combat populismTaoiseach in Zagreb as part of trip to three European capitals to discuss Brexit issuesTaoiseach told ministers doubling \u0026lsquoglobal footprint\u0026rsquo needed in protectionist climateGreystones C of I principal resigns over ranking based on \u0026lsquoparochial engagement\u0026rsquoBritish memo claimed there were \u0026lsquosuspicions that at least two Deputies were bribed\u0026rsquo to vote for HaugheyOfficials arranged for a custom-built headrest to be fitted to deal with her nodding offFiles from 1988 show prime minister was angry at Garda and Haughey response to IRAState papers describe Charles Haughey \u0026lsquobasking\u0026rsquo in president\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoreflected glory\u0026rsquoDavid McCarton (38) recorded video of young girl exposing herself during online contactLamagh collision was one of a series of road traffic incidents on Irish roads on MondayDr Peadar O\u0026rsquoGrady, who was suspended on full pay by HSE three years ago, wants to halt \u0026lsquoflawed\u0026rsquo investigation and return to workMinister for Children says she hopes to bring recommendation to Cabinet by early autumnNBRU writes to Shane Ross after Connolly Station employee assaulted with bottle\u0026lsquoIt sends out a message to other victims as well.

Photograph: Simon DawsonReutersCroatia wants a final Brexit deal between the European Union and the United Kingdom that “suits the interests of Ireland”, Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenkovic has said.The declaration came following a meeting in Zagreb with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, which was dominated by talks about Brexit. Mr Plenkovic described Brexit as “a lose-lose-lose situation” for all parties.Speaking to reporters, the Croatian leader said it is “especially important” for Croatia “ to completely understand” all of Ireland’s concerns about the Border in the Brexit negotiations.Expressing gratitude for Croatia’s “continued solidarity and understanding”, Mr Varadkar said Zagreb has fully understood Ireland’s “unique Brexit concerns”.“We both look forward to a deep and comprehensive future new relationship with the United Kingdom, but that will take many years,” said Mr Varadkar.He went on: “I think everyone understands Ireland’s position when it comes to putting a physical border, a hard border . . . I think we need to avoid that, first of all, through the withdrawal treaty.”Mr Plenkovic said that the UK’s withdrawal from the EU is “a lose-lose-lose situation” from the very beginning: for the former British prime minister David Cameron, the UK and the European project.“Our position is that, in this process that is ahead of us, we must agree upon the withdrawal of the UK and get a clear picture of the future agreement and relationship with the UK,” he said.Currently, the total trade between the two countries is approximately €100 million, though both leaders expressed hopes for significant increases – partly on the back of ties to be developed in 2020 when Galway and Rijeka will both be European Capitals of Culture.Congratulating Croatia on its World Cup performance, Mr Varadkar drew a parallel with Ireland’s performance in the 1990 World Cup in Italy, which had given “the country more self-confidence”, he told his Croatian counterpart.The two leaders also discussed issues of EU budget, migration, security policy and climate change. Later during the day, Mr Varadkar met with Croatia’s president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, and chair of the Croatian parliament Gordan Jandrokovic, before travelling on to Romania.On Tuesday, he will meet with the president of Romania, Klaus Iohannis, and the prime minister, Viorica Dãncilã. Later, he will travel on to Italy.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Brexit is not there of our making or of our choice”The EU should convene an emergency summit in September to resolve the Irish Brexit issues, Sinn Féin has told Michel Barnier. Speaking after a meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator on Brexit, party leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposed Border protocol was the “absolute minimum required to protect Irish interests” and from which there could be no rowing back in talks. That was the case, she said, even if it meant the need for checks on goods in the Irish Sea. “There are already checks in the Irish Sea. So if that is the case then that is the case. The reality is that those who brought us Brexit ought to have considered all of the consequences of that. Brexit is not there of our making or of our choice...” Ms McDonald was in Brussels on Monday with the party’s Northern leader, Michelle O’Neill for the hour-long talks with Mr Barnier.The Sinn Féin leader took issue with the Taoiseach’s suggestion that he should not make preparations for Border infrastructure in the event of a no deal. “The only way that the no-hard-border commitment will be realised is by a legal agreement and by legal text. You can’t wish these things away. Borders are jurisdictional markers,” Ms McDonald said. “ In the absence of an agreement or a protocol there will be a hardening of the Border. De facto. That’s what will happen. So we shouldn’t pretend that that’s not the case...” She said that at their meeting Mr Barnier had been “categorical” in insisting that “that the Irish question must be answered in a legally operable way before the talks move on to the negotiations on the future relationship”. She also said Mr Barnier had strongly defended the Belfast Agreement. “Dublin and Ireland are certainly not alone in wishing to protect Irish interests North and South.” Ms McDonald said British prime minister Theresa May had come to Ireland to “listen and reassure”, but she had done neither. “Her approach was provocative and negative, and consistently rowing back on political commitments entered into last December.” She said two years after Brexit, Ms May’s Conservatives still have no credible answer for Ireland. “What Downing Street need to do is accept that there is an exceptionality in respect of the island of Ireland, that a tailored response is required for the island of Ireland, and they need to start a serious intensive negotiation because a crash is in nobody’s interest. “We have made the case that the British strategy has been to play for time, to talk down the clock. That needs to stop, and we need to know that this cannot indefinitely drift through the summer and into the autumn. “We have made clear that in our view there ought to be a summit in September, and that summit should be the point at which we have the answer to the Irish backstop. We made that case today to Mr Barnier.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

And of course you won\u0027t know happens on these days, while her passport is with her.Social media users decried Ms Alqattan\u0027s comments as racist, and demanded cosmetic brands cut their ties with her. Chelsea Beautique, a make-up company, announced it would remove a video sponsored by Ms Alqattan from its social media channels.Several companies have cut ties with the social media starWe believe that decent working conditions should be provided to everyone and such behavior does not represent our brand’s core beliefs, the company posted on Twitter.A spokesman for French perfume brand M Micallef said his company was shocked by Ms Alqattan\u0027s comments and would end their relationship, Gulf News reported. Ms Alqattan defended her remarks in another video. What do human rights have to do with (the worker) keeping her passport? Even our kids don\u0027t hold on to their passport, she said.Kuwait employs almost 700,000 domestic workers, out of a population of four million. Many of them come from the Philippines, which temporarily banned its citizens from domestic work in Kuwait after a maid was murdered and concealed in a freezer.The ban was lifted this year after Kuwait agreed to grant the workers some protections, after years of complaints by human rights groups against abuses faced by domestic workers in the Gulf emirate. In 2017, Kuwaiti authorities charged a woman after she filmed her domestic worker clinging to a window and pleading for help before falling several stories on to a small metal awning.The woman could be heard taunting the worker, calling her a lunatic.Please review our commenting policyGreece wildfires: At least 20 killed near Athens as residents and tourists fleeGlobal summit shines a spotlight on people with disabilitiesComment: Get things right for disabled people and you make life better for everyoneRoadchef at Norton Canes voted \u0026#39best services in UK\u0026#39 thanks to nice loosTen-fold rise in extreme obesity among school childrenOne in ten female Love Island viewers considering breast surgeryTreachery of Cold War spy Anthony Blunt was kept from Tory prime ministerStoryville: Insha\u0026#39Allah Democracy, review: capturing the dog daysRevealed: White House \u0026#39frustrated\u0026#39 by attempt to dictate trial of the Isil BeatlesThe billionaire rocketmen: Branson, Musk and Bezos in the race for spaceViolence, drugs and sexual diseases: How managed zones for prostitution are failing women worldwideComment: Decriminalising prostitution was supposed to keep sex workers safe – instead, it is more dangerous\u0026#39A disaster from day one\u0026#39: Is this the end of Britain\u0026#39s first \u0026#39legal\u0026#39 red light district?The Bangladesh brothels where men pay child brides for sex – while police look the other wayBoris Johnson warned Government its Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 deal could hurt British opposition to death penaltyBritish expat found dead on Greek Island \u0026#39stabbed to death with screwdriver\u0026#39 How to Get Rich Quick, review: despite honourable intentions, Dave Fishwick\u0026#39s new series was less than titillatingDonald Trump considers revoking security clearance for former Obama-era intelligence officialsBritish opera director criticised by Italy\u0026#39s Right-wing over \u0026#39anti-racist\u0026#39 version of The Magic FluteBritish chemical weapons experts prepare Syria’s doctors for ‘doomsday’ in last rebel strongholdWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"one ten female love island viewers considering breast surgery","story":"Concerns have been raised about advertisements for cosmetic surgery during Love IslandDuty of Care banner adAlmost one in ten women who watch Love Island say it has left them considering breast surgery or botox, a survey shows.Plastic surgeons said such shows were “normalising unrealistic standards of beauty” and heaping pressures on the young.The survey carried out by You Gov shows four in ten female Love Island viewers aged between 18 to 34 said they felt more self conscious about their bodies after watching the show.In total, eight per cent said that watching the reality programme had left them considering breast enhancement surgery, with as many saying the show had increased the chance they would have anti-wrinkle treatments such as Botox.Eleven per cent were now more likely to have lip fillers, with 7 per cent contemplating liposuction, and more than one in five contemplating teeth whitening treatment.Plastic surgeons today joined NHS chiefs in calling for a clampdown on advertising of cosmetic surgery during the programme.Dr Rajiv Grover, consultant Plastic Surgeon and former President of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said the reality shows were heaping pressures on young viewers, which advertisers were able to exploit.“Such programmes, which are frequently aimed at young people, showcase stars who, more often than not, project and normalise unrealistic standards of beauty,” he said.The surgeon said such programmes trivialised the decision to have such treatments - and also left viewers feeling “intense psychological pressure to conform”.Health officials from NHS England have called on the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to consider introducing a “duty of care” for mental health on all broadcast advertisers.It follows warnings from Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS, that advertisements which fuel body insecurity are contributing to mental distress among the young.The research commissioned by feminist campaign group Level Up came from a poll of 4,367 adults, of which 247 were female viewers of Love Island, aged 18 to 34.How to make 2018 the year of better mental healthThe campaigners said it was “irresponsible” to sell advertising space to cosmetic surgery and diet companies.The ASA has said it will meet health officials to discuss how best to protect young viewers.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show on July 1st , Mr Stevens said it is not just the NHS’ job to tackle eating disorders and mental illness in young people, and that social media sites and television shows should take more responsibility.“Take a show like Love Island,” Mr Stevens said.NHS chief Simon Stevens singled out Love Island earlier this month“Look at the adverts being shown alongside Love Island. You\u0027ve got explicit ads being aimed at young women around breast cosmetic surgery. That is all playing into a set of pressures around body image that are showing up.Yesterday a survey by Youth charity YMCA found that 62 per cent of 15 to 16-year-olds felt expectations over their personal appearance had been ramped up by social media. Photoshopped images and the sharing of only flattering shots have shifted young people\u0027s understanding of what a normal body looks like, the charity said.Greece wildfires: At least 20 killed near Athens as residents and tourists fleeGlobal summit shines a spotlight on people with disabilitiesComment: Get things right for disabled people and you make life better for everyoneRoadchef at Norton Canes voted \u0026#39best services in UK\u0026#39 thanks to nice loosTen-fold rise in extreme obesity among school childrenTreachery of Cold War spy Anthony Blunt was kept from Tory prime ministerStoryville: Insha\u0026#39Allah Democracy, review: capturing the dog daysRevealed: White House \u0026#39frustrated\u0026#39 by attempt to dictate trial of the Isil BeatlesThe billionaire rocketmen: Branson, Musk and Bezos in the race for spaceViolence, drugs and sexual diseases: How managed zones for prostitution are failing women worldwideComment: Decriminalising prostitution was supposed to keep sex workers safe – instead, it is more dangerous\u0026#39A disaster from day one\u0026#39: Is this the end of Britain\u0026#39s first \u0026#39legal\u0026#39 red light district?The Bangladesh brothels where men pay child brides for sex – while police look the other wayBoris Johnson warned Government its Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 deal could hurt British opposition to death penaltyBritish expat found dead on Greek Island \u0026#39stabbed to death with screwdriver\u0026#39 How to Get Rich Quick, review: despite honourable intentions, Dave Fishwick\u0026#39s new series was less than titillatingDonald Trump considers revoking security clearance for former Obama-era intelligence officialsBritish opera director criticised by Italy\u0026#39s Right-wing over \u0026#39anti-racist\u0026#39 version of The Magic FluteBritish chemical weapons experts prepare Syria’s doctors for ‘doomsday’ in last rebel strongholdFrench interior minister shifts blame over \u0026#39cover-up\u0026#39 of assault by Macron aideWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"ten fold rise extreme obesity among school children","story":"Health officials said the trends were extremely worrying Ten times as many children are severely obese now as was the case thirty years ago, official figures show.Data from Public Health England (PHE) shows record numbers of children classed as severely obese by the time they leave primary school.In just ten years, the percentage of 11-year-olds with extreme weight problems has risen by more than a fifth in ten years, the analysis shows.Over three decades, the trend is even more stark. In total, 4.1 per cent of such children are now classed as “severely obese” - compared with just 0.4 per cent in 1990.Officials said the trend was “extremely worrying” and showed the need for bold action to tackle the threat to children’s health.Boys are the most likely to carry such extreme weight problems, with 4.78 per cent of them classed as severely obese by the time they leave primary school, along with 3.33 per cent of girls. Children are deemed severely obese if they are above the 99.6th percentile on growth charts from 1990, which were based on typical measurements at the time.Today, 22,000 children in year six at school are in this category, the new statistics show.Last month ministers announced an updated childhood obesity plan including proposals to  ban on advertising of unhealthy foods on television before the 9pm watershed, and two-for-one deals on such foods. Mandatory calorie labelling on menus is also planned, while a sugar tax may be extended to cover milky drinks.Dr Alison Tedstone, PHE chief nutritionist said: “The rise in severe obesity and widening health inequalities highlight why bold measures are needed to tackle this threat to our children’s health. These trends are extremely worrying and have been decades in the making – reversing them will not happen overnight.”Cancer charities urged the Government to implement a TV advertising ban on junk food before 9pm as soon as possible.Professor Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK’s prevention expert, said: “Our research has shown that young people are more than twice as likely to be obese if they remember seeing a junk food advert every day compared to those who couldn’t recall any over a month.Health officials are concerned about the amount of sugar in children\u0026#39s diets “The food industry will continue to push their products into the minds of children if unchecked so we need these regulations to help curb the childhood obesity crisis.”Overall, one in ten children are classed as obese by the time they start primary school - rising to one in five by the time they leave.Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for obesity and diabetes at NHS England said: “The country’s growing obesity epidemic poses problems for the NHS but is also extremely worrying for the nation’s overall health as obesity in childhood paves the way to obesity in adulthood, and overweight or obese people are at greater risk of a number of cancers, heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and other illnesses.”He said the NHS needed to build on current work, including the sugar tax and programmes to encourage weight loss and prevent diabetes.Please review our commenting policyGreece wildfires: At least 20 killed near Athens as residents and tourists fleeGlobal summit shines a spotlight on people

Sketch.Upmarket British label has destroyed £105m of unwanted stock in past five yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBurberry burns £28.6m of clothes and cosmetics \u0027to protect its brand\u0027Burberry\u0026nbspdestroyed £28.6m of clothing and cosmetics last year as part of efforts to\u0026nbspprotect its upmarket brand and guard against counterfeiting.The luxury British label incinerated the equivalent of\u0026nbsp81,000 of its signature plaid scarves, according to its latest annual accounts, in a practice said to be rife among fashion houses.Industry insiders\u0026nbspsay high-end brands burn\u0026nbspunwanted stock to prevent their clothes being sold at knockdown prices and worn by the\u0026nbsp“wrong people”.But the fashion houses\u0026nbspsay surplus goods are incinerated to prevent them falling into the hands of counterfeiters.Burberry destroyed more than £90m of products over the last five years, and the amount burnt annually has increased dramatically. In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

For the rest of the population incomes were stagnant.Inflation spiked above 3 per cent last year, mainly thanks to the record slump in sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote, while average wages remained weak by historic standards.The foundation also calculates\u0026nbspthe official poverty rate – defined as those families living on incomes of less than 60 per cent of the median after accounting for housing costs – rose from 22.1 per cent to 23.2 per cent, the biggest single year jump since 1988.However, Resolution said this jump was “dwarfed” by the increase in the child poverty rate, which shot up in 2017-18 from 30.3 per cent to 33.4 per cent.“2017-18 was a strikingly bad year for lower income households as the 2015 package of benefit cuts began in earnest, in combination with higher inflation,” the think tank said.As part of its drive to eradicate the overall deficit, the Conservatives have, since 2015, frozen the nominal value of tax credits, child benefit and housing benefits. The unexpected spike in inflation after the Brexit vote has accentuated the pain.However, Resolution’s latest “Living Standards Audit” goes considerably further this year than in previous editions, delving into the question of how well official data captures the true UK picture.It points out that grossed-up survey data of benefit spending does not match total government reported outlays and argues that, if one statistically adjusts for this, the picture of the past 15\u0026nbspyears on incomes and poverty changes quite considerably in some respects.First, it suggests that child poverty fell in the 2000s more rapidly than currently thought, dropping from 3 million to around 1.6 million. If correct, this implies that the previous Labour government actually delivered on its pledge to halve child poverty, despite the official verdict that the target was missed by some 600,000 children.Second it suggests that child poverty has actually been rising since 2011 at double the rate implied by official data (although the level of child poverty today would also be lower at around 25 per cent rather than 30 per cent).“Reducing child poverty has been a goal\u0026nbspof politicians from all parties in recent decades. But our analysis shows that child poverty is likely to have risen last year, and that rises since 2010 have been underestimated in official government data,” said Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst\u0026nbspat Resolution.Despite the revised Resolution income series, the think tank still estimates that median incomes began stagnating in the years before the 2008-09 financial crisis, following exceptionally strong growth in the late 2000s.It attributes this slowdown to rising housing costs, a fall in hours for low-skilled male workers, a slowing of benefit increases and a larger share of incomes going to the top 1 per cent of earners.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He said ambition, family situation, socio-economic status and other factors play a bigger role than genes. As with many other outcomes, it is a complex interplay between environment and genetics that matters.Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s.

During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.But he added: It moves us in a clearer direction in understanding the genetic architecture of complex behaviour traits like educational attainment.It would be completely misleading to characterise our results as identifying genes for education, said co-author Daniel Benjamin, of the Centre for Economic and Social Research at University of Southern California.However, social and medical scientists will be able to use the findings to explore the relationship between genetics and the environment in shaping educational attainment.The researchers say some of the genetic variants identified may be linked with educational attainment because they affect people’s health. “Our analyses of genetic overlap suggest that some of the same genes that matter for educational attainment also matter for Alzheimer’s disease, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia,” they said.Gil McVean, professor of statistical genetics at the University of Oxford, said he wasn\u0027t surprised by the findings.Where genetics has been powerful is in telling us about the biological processes we care about, and what this has shown is there\u0027s a lot of variation we come of of the womb with that has an impact later in life.But it did not mean that an inidual cannot be successful, he said. Also it could be that they are good at non-academic things.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But they feared that there was so many smaller galaxies contained within that it would be impossible to learn about any specific one.New computer simulations allowed them to find that while Andromeda had eaten many galaxies, many of the stars found in the halo actually came from one larger shredded galaxy.It was a \u0027eureka\u0027 moment. We realised we could use this information of Andromeda\u0027s outer stellar halo to infer the properties of the largest of these shredded galaxies, said lead author Richard\u0026nbspD\u0027Souza, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan.That galaxy is a long-lost sibling of our own.Astronomers have been studying the Local Group – the Milky Way, Andromeda and their companions – for so long. It was shocking to realize that the Milky Way had a large sibling, and we never knew about it, said co-author Bell, professor of astronomy at the same university.The researchers hope that the discovery can lead to new breakthroughs in understanding how galaxies form and evolve.It also explains some of the strange behaviour in our own universe. It could answer the puzzle of why the\u0026nbspM32\u0026nbspsatellite galaxy near Andromeda has come from – it might be the surviving core of that long-lost sibling, sticking around like the core in a plum.M32 is a weirdo, Bell said. While it looks like a compact example of an old, elliptical galaxy, it actually has lots of young stars. It\u0027s one of the most compact galaxies in the universe.

And when it did, the atmosphere might have been\u0026nbspfar more habitable than it is today, ready to support life, if only briefly.That is according to two senior planetary researchers who found that the Moon might have had conditions to support simple lifeforms some four billion years ago. The same conditions might have arrived during a peak of volcanic activity 3.5 billion years ago, claim the researchers.During that time, the Moon was spewing out vast amounts of very hot gases, including water vapour. Those gases might have formed into liquid water on the surface as well as creating an atmosphere that could keep it there.“If liquid water and a significant atmosphere were present on the early Moon for long periods of time, we think the lunar surface would have been at least transiently habitable,” said Dirk Schulze-Makuch,\u0026nbspan astrobiologist at Washington State University, who wrote the paper with\u0026nbspIan Crawford, a professor of planetary science and astrobiology at the University of London.The Moon is also thought to have been wrapped in a magnetic field that would have kept any lifeforms who lived there safe from deadly solar winds.The earliest evidence of life on Earth comes from about\u0026nbsp3.5 and 3.8 billion years old, in the form of cyanobacteria. During that time, the solar system was a violent place marked by frequent meteorite impacts – it is possible that some life could have been carried up to the moon in the wake of one of those blasts, the researchers suggest.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Things are coming to a head, the source, who spoke on condition on anonymity, told Reuters. He said the latest information from inside the embassy was, It\u0027s not looking good.However, both the Ecuadorean government and British government sources played down suggestions there was likely to be any imminent movement to break the stalemate.Great to smell fresh air says freed AssangeThe Ecuadorian state will only talk and promote understandings about Mr Assange\u0027s asylum, within the framework of international law, with the interested party\u0027s lawyers and with the British government, Ecuador\u0027s foreign ministry said in a statement ahead of the visit.At the moment, due to the complexity of the topic, a short\u0026nbspor long-term solution is not in sight.A British government source also said there was no sign of immediate progress. Last month, Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan told parliament that they were increasingly concerned about Mr Assange\u0027s health.It is our wish that this is brought to an end, and we would like to make the assurance that if he were to step out of the embassy, he would be treated humanely and properly, Mr Duncan said. The first priority would be to look after his health, which we think is deteriorating.WikiLeaks\u0026nbspitself has added to speculation its editor could be facing arrest\u0026nbspafter its Twitter account retweeted multiple news outlets reporting his likely eviction.It comes after 12 Russian spies were charged with election interference in the US. They allegedly hacked the emails of\u0026nbspHillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee and passed them to WikiLeaks, which published them during the 2016 US presidential election.In May, Mr Moreno ordered the withdrawal of additional security from Ecuador\u0027s small diplomatic headquarters in London. That followed a decision in March to suspend Mr\u0026nbspAssange\u0027s communication system and direct voice to the outside world.Mr Assange\u0027s supporters regard him as a champion of free speech who has exposed government abuses of power at great personal cost. His critics see\u0026nbsphim as a criminal who recklessly endangered lives in many countries by exposing secrets.His attempt to halt British legal proceedings failed in February when a judge said Mr Assange appeared to consider himself above the normal rules of law.Britain ended a permanent guard outside the embassy in October 2015 after spending almost £13 million in policing, but has vowed he will be arrested should he leave the embassy.A US\u0026nbspDepartment of Justice investigation into WikiLeaks is continuing but a US\u0026nbsplaw official close to the investigation told Reuters there was no sealed indictment against Mr Assange.Mr Assange has said the US would unveil charges against him if he were arrested by British police and this would pave the way for his extradition.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Seventy-one people were killed after the fire tore through the housing block in KensingtonThe report –\u0026nbspwhich is being presented to the United Nations in Geneva on Monday – called on the government to “ensure that the loss of EU funding does not undermine the UK’s equality and human rights infrastructure, including the already scarce funding available to specialist services, such as those that support women survivors of violence and domestic abuse”.If the Brexit bill were to be passed it in its current form, it would not contain the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which safeguards the rights to non-discrimination, the rights of children and the right to fair and just working conditions.The watchdog also drew attention to the consequences of losing EU funding for schemes to promote gender equality and prevent violence against children, young people, women and other at-risk groups.Wales, for example, reaps the benefits of £370m\u0026nbspa year from the EU, which helps to address the gender pay gap there.The comprehensive report also looks at the position of women living in the UK more generally\u0026nbsp– concluding they are being “failed” in many areas of life.It draws particular attention to a failure in safeguarding women from violence and abuse.Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC, said: “It is estimated that only 15 per cent of survivors of sexual violence report their experience to the police, and social movements such as #MeToo continue to shine a spotlight on areas where women are being failed.“The priority must now be ensuring that women and girls of all ages can enjoy their basic right to feel safe in their everyday lives. Our recommendations are intended to improve the lives of women and girls and to protect their fundamental rights.”The research suggests changes to legal aid have had a “disproportionately adverse” impact on women.It sets out a series of recommendations that include better support for survivors of domestic violence and making moves to\u0026nbspimprove\u0026nbspthe reporting and recording of domestic violence and abuse, and increase prosecution and conviction rates for violent crimes against women and girls.It also calls on the government to ensure services that address the specialist needs of disabled women, black and ethnic minority women, and those with complex needs, are sufficiently funded and supported.While the debate around leaving the European bloc has been heavily centred around the economy, less attention has been given to how it could radically change the rights of Britons.Equality and Human Rights CommissionEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Log inBrexit negotiations appear to be in trouble, with seeming deadlock between Britain and the EU on the issues of the Northern Ireland border and the form a potential trade deal might take. With just three months left until the October talks deadline and few routes to a solution, many are predicting a no-deal. But what does no-deal mean in practice?Theresa May has negotiated a transition period with the EU, during which the UK would continue to follow EU rules (without any say in what they are) for just under two years after it leaves the EU in March 2019.This “implementation period” is supposed to allow time for new post-Brexit arrangements to be put into place – such as a new trade deal for British goods.But this transition period is conditional on a withdrawal agreement being signed. If there is no withdrawal agreement, there is no transition period, and the UK economy faces an abrupt cliff-edge.Under this cliff-edge, the UK would be forced to trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Currently, goods moving between the EU and UK don’t need to be checked at borders and\u0026nbspface no tariffs, and complex supply chains in industries like car-making cross national boundaries.But under WTO rules there would be immediate customs and regulatory checks and the UK and EU would have to pay tariffs on each others’ goods.\u0026nbspThis isn’t something the EU can just opt-out of: the WTO effectively requires countries to charge the same tariffs to countries they don’t have a trade deal with, a rule called the “most favoured nation” tariffs. Grant someone a special favour, and you have to do it to all members.A parliamentary report into a no-deal concluded that “this would almost certainly involve the immediate imposition of tariffs across a range of sectors”.Some tariffs would be more significant than others: the highest would be on British farmers, who would face 30-40 per cent charges for exporting to the EU, effectively making many exports unviable. Lower tariffs would be on things such as\u0026nbspautomotive parts, where a 5\u0026nbspper cent charge would apply.\u0026nbspThese tariffs are what Britain, currently a member of the EU, charges countries outside the EU, as a member of the trade area. Britain would, now outside the EU and without any special opt-out, be on the other side of the fence.We don’t know what precise effect these massive reduction in trade and UK exports would have on the British economy, but it’s fair to say it would not be good. HM Treasury forecast ahead of the referendum, whose most pessimistic scenario was predicated on talks collapsing, suggested that such a Brexit would “push the UK into recession and lead to a sharp rise in unemployment”.Under the WTO rules scenario, the Treasury’s modelling expects unemployment to rise by 820,000 in two years, sterling to fall by 15 per cent, and inflation to rise by 2.7 per cent.As well as economic disruption there would almost certainly be significant physical disruption at ports such as\u0026nbspDover because of the need for customs and regulatory checks on goods.\u0026nbspEven a high-tech system of checking freight lorries requires them to be held for at least\u0026nbspfive or 10\u0026nbspminutes –\u0026nbsplonger if something goes wrong, which it sometimes does.These thousands of lorries a day have to physically be held somewhere. The Independent reported earlier this year that huge dedicated lorry parks planned for coastal areas in Kent won’t be ready for in time for a no-deal in March, after project planning setbacks meant officials had to start from scratch. Instead, the government is planning to close part of a nearby motorway and use it as a massive lorry park.If Britain leaves the single market and customs union the EU says it would have to impose similar border checks anyway, but a transition period would give the UK time to expand its infrastructure to cope.There would be disruption abroad too at ports like Rotterdam which process a lot of British goods.The prices of consumer goods would likely increase significantly under a no-deal, particularly for foods like meats and cheese.\u0026nbspLSE research commissioned by the dairy industry says dairy products would be particularly hit and “see shortages of products and a sharp rise in prices, turning everyday staples like butter, yoghurts, cheese and infant formula, into occasional luxuries”.This, the research claims, is because of the dependence on imported products from Europe and the complex supply chains which would be very sensitive to delays.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab tried to claim at the weekend that the EU would be worse off than the UK from a no-deal, but officials later admitted that he only had evidence that this might be the case for one economic area\u0026nbsp– financial derivatives.The EU economy would likely be damaged by the collapse of talks, but the effects are difficult to quantify.\u0026nbsp53 per cent of British imports come from the EU, and any disruption in trade would work both ways.But the EU27’s economies are about $13.5 trillion compared to the UK’s $2.6 trillion – the two are not equal in size and so the relative importance of the UK’s economy to the EU as a bloc is less than the other way around.The effect would likely be uneven – certain sectors and businesses that trade closely with the UK would be hit hardest. Where there are fewer links, the effect would be less.Under a basic no-deal, EU citizens living in Britain, and British citizens living in the EU, would have no legal status and would technically be illegal aliens in the countries they call home.\u0026nbspEU officials say they want to make contingency plans to stop this happening, but it is unclear what these will be. Like the transition period, the provisions negotiated in the EU withdrawal agreement to protect EU citizens’ rights do not apply in the event of a no-deal, because the whole deal comes as a package.\u0026nbspMinisters have previously said they are using EU nationals as a “bargaining chip” in negotiations.The3Million, a campaign group that represents EU citizens living in the UK, warns that EU citizens are already living in “a new political landscape and an unprecedented uncertainty as to the nature of their resident status in the UK post Brexit.It is questionable whether there would be a majority in parliament to actually allow a no-deal – MPs have defeated the government before to soften Brexit. They could potentially collapse the government over the issue before it happened.Theresa May has however repeatedly said that “no deal is better than a bad deal”, so not getting a deal would not necessarily be the end of her.While the resulting economic malaise and perception of incompetence would probably seriously damage the government in the eyes of the public, many Tory MPs who favour no-deal would probably be fairly content with the outcome.Because it is Tory MPs\u0026nbspand party members who choose who the prime minister is, in absence of an election\u0026nbspit would be down to them whether the prime minister survived.On the other hand, Boris Johnson and anyone else with leadership ambitions currently keeping a low profile might see any political hit for May as their opportunity to strike.From the EU’s perspective, the resulting punishment meted out in the UK economy would probably ensure nobody ever tried leaving the EU again for the near future – lest they turn out like Britain.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/15/air-pol-1.jpg","title":"environment brexit uk air pollution wildlife water quality climate change","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027People only need to look at the government\u0027s utter failure to deal with our roadside air pollution crisis to see why this matters\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsCampaigners say the government\u0027s lack of action on air pollution is evidence of the need for tighter environment protectionsMPs have criticised the “worrying” lack of detail in the government’s long-term plans for the environment and called for legally binding targets to ensure ministers make good on their promises.Air quality, water and wildlife must be all be protected by a “world-leading watchdog” that ensures standards do not drastically slip when the country leaves the EU.Brexit poses a major threat to the current measures in place to protect the UK’s environment, especially if no deal is reached by ministers.The proposed new independent body, modelled after the National Audit Office, will be required to ensure enforcement and rules that are currently the responsibility of the EU are not lost.It would also mean the government and public bodies could be taken to court when standards are breached.Mary Creagh, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee – which produced the report in response to the government’s 25 Year Plan for the Environment – said “if we want a world-leading environment we need a world-leading environmental watchdog”.\u0026nbspDespite the ambitious goals set out in the plan, launched by Theresa May in January, Ms Creagh said based on the government’s record there was a need to tighten these targets.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“In recent months the government has been referred to the EU’s highest court for failing to tackle illegal levels of air pollution in the UK. We are facing a bioersity crisis and risk losing iconic species like the hedgehog,” she said.“The government’s 25 Year Plan is high on ambitions, but low on milestones. The government has more experience of getting rid of environmental watchdogs than of setting them up.”New legislation has already been promised to cover areas like air, waste, water and chemicals that cannot simply be transferred into UK law following Brexit.However, to ensure these pledges are carried out the committee said there was a need to introduce five-yearly plans to ensure ministers are on track to meet their environmental targets.A similar system is already in place to monitor greenhouse gas emissions in the form of the “carbon budgets” set by the Climate Change Act – a system widely regarded as effective and world-leading.“We want an Environmental Governance and Principles Act that sets legally-binding targets and creates a new Environmental Enforcement and Audit Office to measure progress and enforce this new law,” said Ms Creagh.“The government needs to set out detailed delivery and funding proposals for the Plan and departments across Whitehall need to commit to its ambitions, rather than trying to water them down behind the scenes.”Environmental campaigners, who have welcomed the government’s recent announcement that a new environment act is imminent, agreed that current proposals are not strong enough.“No one would argue that we shouldn’t be striving for cleaner air or water along with a vibrant countryside rich in wildlife,” said RSPB conservation director Martin Harper.‘Super-polluting’ trucks allowed to ignore air pollution controlsMajority of young voters would back party that curbs air pollutionGirl\u0027s death first to be linked to illegal levels of air pollution“But to achieve this we need a more transformative piece of legislation – one that delivers ambitious targets for nature, soil, water and air and holds the government to account when standards aren’t met.”Over 100,000 people have signed a Greenpeace petition calling on Michael Gove and Philip Hammond to keep their promise of a world-leading watchdog.MPs are right to call on the government to create an environmental watchdog with powers to require ministers and public bodies to comply with environmental laws,” said Greenpeace’s senior political adviser Rebecca Newsom.“People only need to look at the government\u0027s utter failure to deal with our roadside air pollution crisis to see why this matters.

For the rest of the population incomes were stagnant.Inflation spiked above 3 per cent last year, mainly thanks to the record slump in sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote, while average wages remained weak by historic standards.The foundation also calculates\u0026nbspthe official poverty rate – defined as those families living on incomes of less than 60 per cent of the median after accounting for housing costs – rose from 22.1 per cent to 23.2 per cent, the biggest single year jump since 1988.However, Resolution said this jump was “dwarfed” by the increase in the child poverty rate, which shot up in 2017-18 from 30.3 per cent to 33.4 per cent.“2017-18 was a strikingly bad year for lower income households as the 2015 package of benefit cuts began in earnest, in combination with higher inflation,” the think tank said.As part of its drive to eradicate the overall deficit, the Conservatives have, since 2015, frozen the nominal value of tax credits, child benefit and housing benefits. The unexpected spike in inflation after the Brexit vote has accentuated the pain.However, Resolution’s latest “Living Standards Audit” goes considerably further this year than in previous editions, delving into the question of how well official data captures the true UK picture.It points out that grossed-up survey data of benefit spending does not match total government reported outlays and argues that, if one statistically adjusts for this, the picture of the past 15\u0026nbspyears on incomes and poverty changes quite considerably in some respects.First, it suggests that child poverty fell in the 2000s more rapidly than currently thought, dropping from 3 million to around 1.6 million. If correct, this implies that the previous Labour government actually delivered on its pledge to halve child poverty, despite the official verdict that the target was missed by some 600,000 children.Second it suggests that child poverty has actually been rising since 2011 at double the rate implied by official data (although the level of child poverty today would also be lower at around 25 per cent rather than 30 per cent).“Reducing child poverty has been a goal\u0026nbspof politicians from all parties in recent decades. But our analysis shows that child poverty is likely to have risen last year, and that rises since 2010 have been underestimated in official government data,” said Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst\u0026nbspat Resolution.Despite the revised Resolution income series, the think tank still estimates that median incomes began stagnating in the years before the 2008-09 financial crisis, following exceptionally strong growth in the late 2000s.It attributes this slowdown to rising housing costs, a fall in hours for low-skilled male workers, a slowing of benefit increases and a larger share of incomes going to the top 1 per cent of earners.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Until four years ago Fatima Abu Shedeg was not only unable to swim but had never been in a pool.\u0026nbspYet despite the challenges she has faced, she spends her days dreaming of stepping onto the starting block at\u0026nbspthe Tokyo 2020 Games as Gaza’s first Olympic swimmer.\u0026nbspIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. She saw her uncle’s legs blown off in the same airstrike that killed her father and destroyed most of their home in Beit Lahia, north Gaza.\u0026nbspLike many children in the tiny enclave, she suffered from post-traumatic stress.\u0026nbspThen Amjed Tantesh, 42, a swimming coach and one-time Olympic hopeful, encouraged her to learn to swim as a way of channelling her depression and anger.\u0026nbsp“A week after my dad passed away Amjed called my mum and offered me and my brother swimming lessons. My dad was killed by shrapnel from an airstrike which ricocheted off the wall and hit his heart. The same airstrike blew off my uncle’s leg. We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City.\u0026nbsp“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she added.\u0026nbspFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic\u0026nbspspends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles long.She said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger.\u0026nbsp“I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,”\u0026nbspshe said.\u0026nbspIn June Save the Children\u0026nbspreported that a staggering 95 per cent of children in Gaza had depression, consistent with deep psychological distress. The charity said the constant threat of conflict, the fear of bombs, and the constant insecurity caused by the unstable political situation had created a psychological crisis in the country.\u0026nbspMany fear Gaza is now on the brink of another war with Israel as tensions have reached boiling point.\u0026nbspOn Friday the Israeli army said one of its soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen near the border, the first Israeli military death near Gaza since the 2014 war. The army unleashed a tide of airstrikes that pummelled over 60 military targets in the enclave, in one of the most intense days of violence in four years.By the end of the day, the Gaza health ministry said that at least four Palestinians had been killed. As fires raged through the strip, a shaky truce brokered by Egypt was enforced. On Saturday, the United Nations urged both sides it was “imperative” to step back from the brink of a “devastating conflict”.At the heart of the latest eruption of hostilities is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests near the border fences that the Israeli army has met with force. More than 140 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire since 30 March, when residents of Gaza first marched on the fences demanding right to return to ancestral lands they were forced from during the 1948 war which surrounded the creation of Israel.\u0026nbspSome of the protesters have taken to launching burning kites and balloons attached with explosives at Israel, sparking more than 750 wildfires and scorching 2,600 hectares of land.The Palestinians maintain the protests are peaceful and Israel is firing on them with live ammunition. Israel says their soldiers have been attacked and the wildfires are endangering Israeli citizens.\u0026nbspEarlier this week saw the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza and Israel since the 2014 conflict. Egypt reportedly intervened to stop war breaking out.Amid the escalating conflict, children, like Fatima, have suffered the most.\u0026nbspMr Tantesh said there were few resources or outlets for the youth to deal with trauma, though\u0026nbspswimming had\u0026nbspproven\u0026nbspa cheap alternative.\u0026nbspHe launched his swimming initiative in 1999 and said he has since taught more than\u0026nbsp5,400 children to swim. \u0026nbspBecause he initially\u0026nbsplacked access to pools and so, in the aftermath of the 2014 war, Tantesh built a makeshift sea pool\u0026nbspby using concrete blocks from bombed-out buildings to cordon off an area of the beach in north Gaza, where the water is less polluted.\u0026nbspIn 2015 alone, he taught some 465 children, with most of them receiving free swimming lessons.\u0026nbsp“All of them are war afflicted, they have lost a father, mother, relative or they have had a house destroyed,” he told The Independent.“But our new ambition is to prepare some of those children to qualify for the Olympics. Fatima is by far our best chance, she has developed the fastest and so we hope she will represent Gaza in Tokyo 2020. I have never seen such determination and persistence,” he added.Meet the girl who wants to be Gaza’s first Olympic SwimmerFatima Abu Shedeg, 13, dreams of leaping from the blocks at Tokyo 2020Fatima has survived three wars and until four years ago she was not only unable to swim but had never been in a poolIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.

The United Nations said that more than 100 million litres of waste water are pumped into the sea off Gaza every day.With filthy beaches and not enough electricity\u0026nbspto keep pools clean, trying to train a swimming team is near impossible, according to the Olympic Committee in Gaza.\u0026nbspIn a battered office and sat in front of a battery-powered fan, Munther Masalmeh, the committee’s secretary-general, said it would be a “major achievement” for a swimmer in Gaza to reach the Olympics.“There is not a single pool in Gaza that hits international standards. With our infrastructure problems it makes it even harder. It would be a major achievement to have a female swimmer here because of the lack of resources,” he told The Independent.The Israeli blockade also restricts access to sports equipment. Mr Masalmeh claimed even iron goal posts were banned because the Israelis feared\u0026nbspthey could be used to make weapons.“Sports equipment gets stuck in the ports for year and does not reach the athletes. In addition, the Israelis have in the past banned players from leaving Gaza to participate in international tournaments,” he added.Nonetheless, Fatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.“I want to achieve my dream to be picked for the Olympics, so I can travel and compete in the 100m race,” she said, putting on her swimming pyjamas.“I don’t just want to participate, I want to get first place,\u0026nbspso those who picked me are proud.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and on Monday, temperatures soared to their hottest in the whole year so far.A record-breaking 33.3C was recorded in Santon Downham, Suffolk, after Brits were warned to stay out of the blazing sun as a blast of hot air dubbed the Mediterranean melt moved in.On Tuesday, its set to be another scorcher, with temperatures across the south-east and London area forecast to be around 30C.Temperatures are forecast to reach 35C this week as the scorching conditions creep even higher.Forecaster Craig Snell said: “We are fairly certain the UK could see the hottest spell this year despite this heatwave having held its grip since June.“More warm air will move into from the continent by the end of the week making it highly likely we will at least have the hottest day this year.Overnight there is occasional rain forecast in southern Scotland, moving down into the north-west of England and Wales.This is set to move further south-eastwards on Tuesday, and though the rest of the country should bathe in hot sunshine there may be some isolated thundery showers.The current spell of good weather has gone on and on, but there could be some changeable conditions coming up.Wednesday to Friday: Experts at the Met Office say there will be some thundery showers in the east on Wednesday, although conditions elsewhere should be largely dry.On Thursday the rain is set to spread into the west, with more risk of thunderstorms on Friday.Next week: The weekend is set to be dry with sunny spells, but with some cloudier and windier conditions in the west and north-west, and some rain.Although there will be some fresher temperatures over the weekend, the hot conditions look set to return later on in the week.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 -

She would have let Charlotte run riot in her bedroom, trying on all her designer clothes and shoes and raiding her make-up bag.It’s so tragic that all of these happy times were not to be. When William saw all of his children come into the world, most especially baby Charlotte, he must have felt the loss of his mother even more keenly.Diana would have been there with her arms full of presents, and not just for the babies. There would have been thoughtful gifts for Kate and lots of hugs and happy tears.You can well picture her ­giving newlywed Harry a cheeky nudge and telling him to “get on with it” so she could have more grandchildren to spoil.I also think that if Diana had still been alive this sad situation between Meghan Markle and her dad would never have been allowed to turn so toxic.Diana would have seen this potential problem looming even before the engagement was announced and nipped it firmly in the bud.She would have insisted and ensured he was invited to the UK and would have dispensed shrewd and invaluable advice on how to deal with all of the hoopla surrounding the wedding. Diana learned the hard way how to deal with the media and palace officials. She was misquoted, manipulated and misunderstood during her time as a royal wife and knew all the pitfalls and how to avoid them.Skittish Meghan would have been soothed and calmed and all of the bad feeling among the Markle family would have surely evaporated.Diana would have advised Meghan’s dad on his wedding suit, helped him with his speech and rehearsed him walking down the aisle.She would have put this rather shy and ordinary man completely at ease.Rather than watching his daughter getting married on TV while cowering in a cheap bed and breakfast in the US, he would have been an integral part of the happiest day of her life.Instead, we have a constant stream of ill-advised interviews given by Thomas where he appears to have been ignored and abandoned and, whether it’s fair or not, Meghan seems increasingly cold-hearted.Photos yesterday of. him celebrating his 74th birthday alone with just a fast food takeaway for company don’t exactly help, whether they were staged again or not.A present, phone call or card from Meghan would have gone a long way to build bridges.It’s all turning a tawdry soap opera meaning commentators such as Sharon Osbourne will keep the pot boiling.Just this week she inferred Thomas has a drink problem and should get clean, ensuring more lurid headlines and bad feeling as he furiously has to deny all of the allegations.No one is coming out of this well and never has Princess Diana been more missed.Harry needs her wise counsel and William knows what an important part she could have played in the lives of his ­children.I know her sons will never really get over her death, but I do hope when William looks into his daughter’s beautiful eyes he is heartened to see a reflection of his mum rather than finding it ­unbearably sad.THE way BBC News treated Cliff Richard was utterly shameful and I’m not in the least surprised it lost its court case.The poor man went through years of hell and became a virtual recluse – and his physical and mental health was profoundly affected.At a time when he should have been enjoying the rewards of a lifetime’s graft, he was enduring sleepless nights and often crying in anguish on the kitchen floor.Many in the media have expressed fear and disquiet that any sort of Cliff’s Law will mean restrictions on newspapers, radio and TV, and this is indeed troubling.But the blame should be pointed firmly at those who thought it was a good idea to send a helicopter to film and report an OTT police raid on an innocent man.Seeing Cliff outside the courtroom this week looking extremely fragile and on the verge of tears was heartbreaking.Clearly the sunny, friendly, optimistic Peter Pan of Pop has gone for good and in his place is a haggard, careworn, wary victim.Before the court case, Cliff told me he doesn’t have photos taken with fans and their children any more.It was painful to see the hurt and mistrust in his eyes.He then revealed this week that his VIP status meant he was allowed to use the secret Wimbledon tunnel under Centre Court and Court No1 to bounce quickly between both venues and view as much tennis as possible.Cliff doesn’t do that any more, and never will, because the tunnel goes past the ball boys’ changing area and he doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he could potentially be accused of something unspeakable.I really hope that when enough time has passed he can get some of that old “glass half full” spirit back, but he will never be the person he was.And no one else should have to go through such a hideous ordeal when they have done nothing wrong.IF you don’t want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, cry and come out singing Abba songs, we can’t be friends.I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – a rare example of a sequel that is better than the original.The starry cast includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, PIerce Brosnan, Andy Garcia and Colin Firth. But the cherry on the icing on the cheesecake is the legend that is Cher.I was lucky enough to host the world premiere this week in London and had the chance to talk to the cast, who were effusive in their praise of Her Cherness.It was surprising to hear she STILL gets nervous before going on set and she was genuinely bewildered by all the love in the air for her.I thought one elderly gay gentleman was going to explode with happiness when Cher blew him a kiss.It was so endearing – and there is nothing more deliciously camp than Cher stepping out of a helicopter in a blonde wig and sequins before going on to sing Super Trouper. She’s a class act and a throughly lovely woman.WATCHING politicians squabble like ferrets in a sack soon loses its novelty value – and our eyes are now glazing over whenever the dreaded subject of Brexit rears its ugly head.But we should never forget that when we woke up the day after the referendum – to discover a majority had voted to leave the EU – there was NO actual plan.Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.There wasn’t even a “to do” list.Instead, all the rats deserted the sinking ship, claiming the dog had eaten their homework or a big boy did it and ran away – leaving the (female) PM to tidy up their reeking mess. Funny that.No matter which way you voted, surely we can all agree on one thing.There was little or no thought put into how to actually implement such a seismic change. Not even a few notes on the back of a fag packet.Now, two years down the line, the whole big, fat mess is farcical and beyond parody.As a nation, we are a laughing stock.Shame on all those careerists and fence-sitters for their arrogance, stupidity and downright mendacity in not having even a half-arsed plan in place.A parcel of rogues, right enough.IF you fancy a right good laugh at some silly, bonkers, hilarious fun and games, tune in to BBC1 today at 5.05pm for another helping of Wedding Day Winners with myself and Rob Beckett.One couple will actually get married at the end of the show and it’s all very lighthearted and joyful.DID Burberry REALLY need to make a bonfire of its overpriced designer swag and burn an eye-watering £28million worth of clothing and cosmetics?In line with other designer labels, the fashion house claims the move was to stop counterfeiters getting their hands on garments and using them to produce fakes.But surely that just doesn’t add up.If criminals want to reproduce any designer clothes or handbags, they can go into any shop and purchase something – or, even simpler, just order it online.Could Burberry not instead have the mother of all sales in aid of Help for Heroes, or for the homeless charity Centrepoint, or any number of deserving causes here and in the Third World?That £28million would have gone a hell of a long way to help those in need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV. Like Mary Beard.”David added that he would only be hired now: “If I had tombstone teeth and rather funny hair and made a lot of noise about that fact.”Oh dear.Where even to start? When you resort to attacking someone’s appearance, you are in trouble.It’s not Mary Beard that has held back his career. It’s David himself.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the payments if youre part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £348 if youre single, £464 if youre part of a couple or £812 if you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments.

Also try to carry water when travelling.” The lack of rainfall means it is set to be the driest July since records began in 1910.Brooms Barn, near Bury St Edmunds, has not seen rain since June 5 — 48 days.The last day of widespread rainfall for East Anglia and the south-east was 29 May.Several places have had 54 consecutive dry days. Others have had less than 1mm of rain since the end of May.A hosepipe ban will be imposed on seven million people in the north west from August 5.Other water firms have urged customers to have four minute showers rather than baths to conserve water.The Woodland Trust yesterday said the scorching heat may mean blackberries and rowan berries will ripen early.During the summer heatwave in August 2003, scorching temperatures over three weeks resulted in 15,000 extra deaths, mostly among the elderly.If temperatures top 24C (75F) for three days running London Underground will deploy hot weather notices and supply bottled water.Maintenance workers for Network Rail will also begin work to stop rails buckling.

Police were given a 1 per cent pay rise with a 1 per cent bonus for 2017-2018.NHS workers were given a 6.5 per cent pay rise over three years in March.The professions covered by today’s announcement include the Armed Forces, teachers, doctors, dentists, police officers and prison guards.Today’s move comes after Britain’s biggest civil service union – the PCS – was forced to drop plans for a national strike over pay.Only 41 per cent of its members bothered to vote in a strike ballot – below the minimum 50 per cent threshold. Some 85 per cent of those who did vote backed industrial action.But PCS chief Mark Serwotka admitted the union may now have to consider smaller scale strikes in certain Government departments.He stormed: “Our members have delivered a huge yes vote for strike action and will feel palpable anger at not being able to exercise their democratic right to withdraw their labour.”GOT a story?

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has insisted he will not seek guarantees that terrorists Alexanda Kotey and Shafee El-Sheikh will be spared execution if tried in America. The West London pair, two of the IS “Beatles” killers, have been stripped of their UK citizenship. Mr Javid has told US Attorney General Jeff Sessions Britain will demand no “assurances” over their capital punishment. His letter of June 22 stated: “I am of the view there are strong reasons for not requiring a death penalty assurance in this specific case, so no such assurances will be sought.”  Mr Javid insisted “this case does not reflect a change in our policy on assistance in US death penalty cases”. But there has been fury over the decision. Lord Carlile, ex-terrorism independent reviewer, claimed the letter was “extraordinary, a dramatic change of policy by a minister, secretly, without discussion in Parliament”.  Allan Hogarth, from Amnesty International, said: “This is a deeply worrying development.” Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti said: “Sajid Javid is not just playing with the lives of these terrorists but those of other Britons all over the world.”  Kotey and El-Sheikh have been held by US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces since January . Security Minister Ben Wallace claimed the Government does “not think we have the evidence to try them in the UK”. He added: “We are not talking here about UK citizens.” The pair along with Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed Jihadi John, and Aine Davis were called the Beatles due to their English accents.

He did not turn up at a regular meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party amid mounting criticism of his alleged failure to clamp down on abuse of Jews from some grassroots activists and his committed supporters. A Labour source said: “Jeremy was never scheduled to attend.” It is understood he was in a meeting on “preparing for government”. But, his decision to snub the gathering in a Commons committee room smashed the convention the party leader always addresses the final meeting before the summer break. It comes after senior backbencher Dame Margaret Hodge angrily confronted Mr Corbyn in the Commons last week, calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.  She told the BBC: “I have always in the past disagreed with the people who have called him an anti-Semite but, at the end of the day, people have to be judged on what they do and not what they say. “They have to be judged on their actions and not their words. “I think what has happened over the last months - from failure to respond to anti-Semitism against Labour Party members, from failure to respond to the massive demonstration, unique demonstration by the Jewish community, culminating in the failure to adopt in full the universally used definition of anti-Semitism is just a bridge too far.” Dame Margaret revealed she received a wave of anti-Semitic abuse since her confrontation with the party chief. “Since the incident in the House of Commons last week I have clearly had a spate of anti-Semitic emails and social media messages - although I have to say I think I have had more supportive messages than negative ones,” she said.  Abuse included being branded a “Zionist b****” and told she was “under the orders of my paymasters in Israel”. Mr Corbyn’s spokesman last week said the MP faces “action” over the row. But Dame Margaret added: “Within 12 hours of actually talking to Jeremy Corbyn face-to-face I received a disciplinary letter - 12 hours. “Think how long it has taken for the Labour Party to respond at all to any of the allegations of anti-Semitism.” Insisting she would not quit the party, she said: “I am going to fight within the Labour Party and it is terrible that in 2018 I have to do that.” Dame Margaret’s lawyers suggested Labour launched a “veiled attempt to silence” her.

The TUC suggested relaxing dress codes, allowing staff to work flexible hours to avoid travelling in the rush hour and keeping offices cool by providing fans and cold drinks. Staff are not expected to work when the temperature drops below 16C - or 13C if they are do physically demanding work, but there are no restrictions for when the workplace becomes too hot. The TUC has been campaigning for a change in the law to introduce a new maximum indoor temperature of 30C, or 27C for those doing strenuous jobs.  General secretary Frances O\u0027Grady said: It\u0027s no fun working in a baking office or factory and employers should do all they can to take the temperature down. The most simple way for staff to keep cool inside when it\u0027s scorching outside is being able to work in more casual clothing. While shorts and vest tops may not be appropriate for all, nobody should be made to wilt in the heat for the sake of keeping up appearances.

John Major’s Government made a $40billion bid to prop up the pound in the financial fiasco which saw interests rates hiked from 10% to 15% in a single day. Following the dramatic events of September 16 1992, Chancellor Norman Lamont was under pressure to spell out how much of Britain’s foreign currency reserves were pumped into the failed operation to prevent sterling crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Publicly, he insisted no government would reveal such information. But papers released by the National Archives show that behind the scenes, he was “increasingly anxious” about the way the true state of the reserves was being concealed. The failure to prevent sterling plunging from the ERM - which pegged its value to the Deutschmark - was a personal humiliation for Mr Major. As Chancellor, he took Britain into the ERM just two years earlier.  Figures finally released by the Treasury in 2005 under the Freedom of Information Act showed that in the course of August and September 1992, the Bank of England sold almost $40billion dollars in foreign currency as the pound came under sustained attack from foreign speculators. The final cost of the operation was estimated at \u0026pound3.3billion. But while Treasury reserves dropped from $18 billion dollars to a negative balance of $16billion dollars, official figures at the time showed only a “minimal” loss of $2billion. Precise details of what happened were spelled out in a letter to No 10 from Mr Lamont’s private secretary Jeremy Heywood - now the Cabinet Secretary - dated November 26, 1992 outlining the Chancellor’s strategy for rebuilding the reserves. The government had disguised the amount of additional borrowing required, partly through creating a “secret negative forward book”, to buy back foreign exchange through “forward swaps” worth around $12.5billion. Once the crisis was over, the opaque manner in which the operation was conducted meant the only way of running down the forward book was through a “non-publicised” programme of using sterling to buy back foreign currency - known as “creaming off”. “In principle the forward book could be run down either by public borrowing or lower gross reserves but having consciously disguised this part of the September’s operations it would now be very difficult to explain the real reason why we were now undertaking further borrowing or revealing lower gross reserves,” the letter states. “That points to non-publicised ‘creaming off’ as the only acceptable approach - it is also the only way the net reserve position can be improved.” The Bank was “very cautious” about the tactic fearing it could lead to further falls in the pound, fuelling inflation. In an accompanying memo, Mary Francis in the No 10 private office notes: “He (Mr Lamont) is increasingly anxious about the way it is being used to conceal the actual state of the reserves.”  James Callaghan secretly urged officials to find ways of ousting left-wing trade union leaders causing trouble for the government “by one means or another”, according to bombshell official papers released today(TUES). Files show that as Home Secretary in Harold Wilson’s Labour government, Mr Callaghan was deeply concerned about the rise of a new generation of “politically motivated” workers’ chiefs. In particular he singled out Jack Jones, the general secretary of the giant Transport and General Workers Union, and Hugh Scanlon, the leader of the engineering workers. Senior officials suggested undermining those with suspected communist leanings through “inspired leakages” to the press. Officials were reluctant to act, fearing it could revive the controversy which erupted three years earlier when Mr Wilson denounced the leaders of a strike by seamen as “a tightly knit group of politically motivated men” - triggering claims ministers were using MI5 to spy on unions. They did however suggest one possible course of action, noting: “Sir Denis Barnes said, however, that detailed exposure of Jones’ behaviour from time to time, perhaps by way of inspired leakages to the press, might be useful and productive.” The details are disclosed in a note of a meeting between the Cabinet Secretary Sir Burke Trend, the head of the Department of Employment Sir Denis Barnes, and James Waddell, a senior Home Office official, headed “Communism in Industry”. Dated March 5, 1969, it is marked “Secret and Personal” with only one copy to be retained. It notes: “Sir Burke Trend recalled that the Home Secretary apparently had in mind that it might be possible by one means or another for the more ‘politically motivated’ trade union leaders - in particular Mr Scanlon and Mr Jack Jones - to be supplanted by others more orthodox and it had been envisaged that further consideration might perhaps be given to this possibility.” Mr Callaghan’s struggles with the unions were widely blamed for the fall of his government 10 years later following the strikes of the “winter of discontent” The file also includes a note from Foreign Secretary George Brown to Mr Wilson explaining how the English Section of the Foreign Office’s secretive Information Research Department (IRD) - set-up to counter Soviet Cold War propaganda - carried out such selective briefings. “By discreet dissemination of such papers to trusted contacts, eg to various Labour Party officials at Transport House over the years, and to selected journalists, the English Section has done much to expose the activities of Communist front organisations in Britain,” Mr Brown said. The files also show how, in 1974, the BBC director general Charles Curran invited the IRD to brief the Board of Governors on “the influence of subversive movements” in the field of broadcasting - although, with a general election looming, officials were doubtful about the idea. “A leak that HMG was briefing the BBC on subversion might rebound in some perverse way related to the ‘reds under beds’ aspects of the last election period, and at any time it could be distorted into allegations of attempts to bring political influence to bear on the impartiality of the BBC,” one warned. The files show that Mr Wilson was not the only prime minister concerned about subversive influence. In 1985 Margaret Thatcher authorised the revival of the secretive Whitehall Subversion in Public Life committee - including spies from MI5 - amid fears the Militant Tendency was trying to infiltrate the Civil Service. The PM was said to be “somewhat disquieted” to find there were an estimated 1,400 MT members in the Civil Service - some in the ranks of management. They showed themselves capable of causing disruption “out of all proportion to their numbers”, documents reveal. Mrs Thatcher’s private secretary Nigel Wicks wrote she believed managers needed to be “very ready to sack subversive troublemakers if they showed any cause under Civil Service rules”.

In a video released by the Royal Family, the world famous building\u0027s labyrinth of corridors is showcased on an epic scale. It shows how staff navigate the winding hallways leading to the Chinese Drawling Room, where royal functions are often held. The clip also looks at Buckingham Palace\u0027s lift system and how revamp work currently underway plans on making travelling around the 515 metres of corridor to the drawing room eaiser. The palace has nine lifts, many of which are old and too small for purpose, according to lead architect Tony Barnard.  He claimed the updated lift system would allow staff more practical and efficient journeys to the Chinese Drawing Room in the future, as well as making the building more accessible for wheelchair users. The Royal Family tweeted the clip with a message reading: Many of the lifts at the Palace are old and impractical - here\u0027s how staff currently navigate from the kitchens to the palace\u0027s Chinese Drawing Room for functions. Along with a sneak peak inside the corridors and grand drawing room, the clip also featured scenes in less ornate parts of the palace, which was built in 1703. It showed where butlers spend time in the basement, preparing for events and functions upstairs.  Architects are also using laser technology to create hi-tech images of the palace\u0027s interior. Known as \u0027Point Cloud\u0027 technology, the cameras allow architects to see the palace without any of its interior walls - offering a clearer map how its 400 rooms relate to one another. The eye-watering \u0026pound369 million revamp project began in April 2017 and will be paid for by taxpayers via the Sovereign Grant - an annual fee paid to the monarch by the Government. While rewiring and lift work has already began, the entire project is expected to take 10 years - finishing in April 2017. A statement about the work posted on the Royal Family\u0027s website said: The Palace\u0027s electrical cabling, plumbing and heating have not been updated since the 1950s.

Soban Sadiq and Tayyaba Soban claim staff at the supermarket discriminated against seven-year-old Muhammed Soban.  He opened the packet of his favourite Lidl jelly beans his parents were going to go on to pay for but the manager allegedly called it theft and said they should be able to control their child.  The family told Liverpool Echo their experience was mental torture.   But Lidl has since apologised and insists a full investigation will be carried out at its store in Kensington, Liverpool. Mrs Soban, 29, said: Its discrimination, disrespect and shows a complete lack of awareness. The whole experience was mental torture for all of us. Usually what our son will do is open the jelly beans and take out a few of the colourful ones because he is obsessed with colour. Then we will seal the pack, put it in the trolley and will pay at the end. But yesterday one of the workers came up to my husband Soban and said we had to pay first. My husband explained to him that we know the rules but our son has autism. We showed him the three disability cards and explained if we went to the queue now, which was really long, he would have an episode.  The manager said it was a theft and that we should be able to control our child. How is it a theft. We didn\u0027t leave the store. We know there is CCTV. Why would we steal 75p jelly beans? To say we should be able to control our child is so disrespectful. If you try to take something from a child with autism they will start screaming and have a melt down. The way it was dealt with was so disrespectful and showed complete lack of compassion or disability awareness. The healthcare assistant, who has recently completed a PHD in pharmacology from the University of Liverpool, wants to raise the awareness of everyday discrimination parents with disabled children can face.

Maxwell, sentenced to three years and three months in a young offenders institution, had passed his driving test just one week before. The vehicle swung onto the wrong side of the road before mounting the footpath and crashing into the pedestrians after overtaking at high speed as it approached a roundabout, Basildon Crown Court heard.

Thurrock Services, on the M25, was described by disgruntled drivers as \u0026shy“gloriously ugly” and “a building site”. Reviews claimed the service station’s toilets were “disgusting” and advised: “Avoid if you have other options.” But while the Essex pit-stop was bottom on just 68% in the poll by watchdog Transport Focus, the top six were all found in the Midlands or the North.  Top-rated Norton Canes, on the M6 in Staffordshire, was awarded a perfect 100 – impressing users with its clean toilets, friendly staff and food and drink options. However drivers must pay \u0026pound5.90 during the week to access the toll road it is on.

Heston East on the M4 also stepped up with revamped loos and a Greggs to score 88, up from 62 last year.  But while nine out of 10 users were happy with facilities and staff, a third said food and drink were poor value. And two-thirds moaned at rip-off fuel prices. Checks by the Mirror found service station petrol as much as 19p a litre up on the national average, at 147.9p.  Lucky motorists at Tiverton on the M5 pay a 3p premium at 131.9p a litre.

The Met Office issued an amber warning, one off national emergency level, as the hot spell shows no sign of burning out with temperatures soaring towards 100F (38C). A plume of sweltering air dubbed the Mediterranean Melt is set to make Britain hotter than Jamaica by the end of the week. The blistering heat peaked at 92F (33.3C) at Santon Downham in Suffolk today – the hottest so far this year. But that is tipped to soar to at least 95F (35C) on Thursday and Friday in some parts. High temperatures are expected to stay for much of the school summer holiday. But as sunseekers flock to parks and beaches to enjoy the balmy weather, the heat is taking its toll as canals run dry, crops wilt and hosepipe bans begin.  Scorching sun was blamed for a grass fire near an airport runway today that threatened two empty planes nearby. No one was injured and fire crews quickly put out the flames at Bournemouth Airport in Dorset. The jets, believed to belong to Nigerian airline Azman Air, were being kept there for restoration work. The airport said: “The prolonged dry weather may well be a factor.” Some areas have had 54 dry days in a row, the Met Office said – a headache for farmers, who warn vegetable prices could rise as crops wilt. Carrot grower Rodger Hobson said his crop is down 30% on last year at his York farm – and warned of a shortage until next June. He added: “We normally plant in March and April, but because of the snow we didn’t get them planted until May. It’s not just the water shortage, it’s also the temperatures.It’s 25C and the carrots just wilt.” Other crops are suffering too, after recent warnings about lettuce and peas struggling to grow as they are unaccustomed to the heat.  Charles Bennett, of the family-run Sandy Lane Farm near Tiddington, Warwickshire, said: “Everyone is experiencing the same issues with certain crops. “I think it’s likely we’ll see the price of food go up and we’ll all end up paying a bit more.” The National Farmers’ Union has warned of crops “parched to the bone” and livestock farmers using winter rations – which will cause problems later in the year. Farmers have reported crops “shrivelling up” and dying in the heat. Temperatures are approximately 10C higher than average for the time of year.  Bookmaker Coral cut odds to 2-1 on breaking the 101.3F (38.5C) record set on August 10, 2003 at Brogdale, Kent. The Met Office tweeted today: “Our 6-30 day outlook for the UK suggests that for at least the next four weeks, temperatures will remain above average for most, with further spells of very warm or hot conditions probable.” It warned people to “either stay out of the sun or be sensible and don’t go out in the strongest sunshine hours (11am to 3pm)”.The warning applies mostly to southern and eastern England, where people are being urged to wear sun screen and lighter clothing, and to check on elderly relatives and neighbours. Health services are expecting a surge in sun stroke patients as advice to draw curtains and close windows was issued. The amber, or level three, warning comes when temperatures are predicted to hit 86F (30C) during the day, and 59F (15C) at night for at least two consecutive days. Many parts of the South and Midlands have had virtually no rainfall for almost two months.

Get yourself a fan stat\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCourtney Pochin16:39, 15 JUL 2018Updated16:52, 23 JUL 2018News (Image: E+)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe country is currently basking in sunshine, with high temperatures only rising each day. You\u0027ve probably tried just about everything to get yourself to sleep during the heatwave. From kicking off the covers to sticking your blanket in the freezer. But there\u0027s one very simple thing you might not have thought to do - and it only takes a few seconds to accomplish. It involves placing an electric fan in front of your open window. The unconventional trick is championed by New Zealand-based eco design adviser, Nelson Lebo, who learnt it from his grandmother in the seventies.  Nelson, who is originally from the US, told The  that the method works as the fan blows the warm air from your home outwards and pulls cooler air in. He said the fan should be set up just after sunset, when the temperature outside starts to get cooler. He added: “Everyone knows about cross ventilation, but it only works when the wind is blowing and then it works best when there is a direct route for the wind to blow through a home. “What the fan does is, it forces cross ventilation, even when the wind is not blowing. A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.  “The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.” There are many other ways to stay cool in the heat . However a dad has recently recently revealed the one thing you should never do . Which is to drink lots of ice cold water. Adam Schaub warned people on Facebook of the dangers of drinking too much cold water too quickly in the heat.  After starting to go a bit red in the sun, he went to cool off in his dad\u0027s van. He drank two bottles of water, but began to feel strange. He said: It was odd because after chugging both bottles of water my head went a bit foggy and I felt confused. I was sitting in my dad\u0027s truck when it got real bad though. My hands and feet were tingling heavily as it they had just fallen asleep and my stomach was turning.

It was a crucial moment in her work to help reduce the stigma surrounding the disease as it publicly challenged the idea that HIV could be passed from person to person through touch. Diana devoted herself to helping those suffering - and now her son is doing the same. This week Prince Harry will be attending The International AIDS Conference 2018, held in the Netherlands.  The conference takes place from July 23 to July 27 and will welcome around 18,000 participants from across the world. These will be in the form of scientists, activists, health providers and policy makers.  Harry will be joining the conference for two days to help highlight the struggles faced by teenagers who have the disease.  He will be working with his charity Sentebale, which he founded in 2006 to support the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana.   Alongside the prince, Sir Elton John, an old friend of Diana\u0027s , will also be in attendance to launch the MenStar coalition, which is a global AIDS organisation aiming to target HIV infection.  President of the International AIDS Society and AIDS 2018 co-chair Linda-Gail Bekker said Harry\u0027s commitment to fighting AIDS is inspiring. We are so grateful to him for his leadership in the HIV response and the strong collaboration between Sentebale and the International AIDS Society. Cathy Ferrier, CEO of Sentebale, added: It is a privilege for Sentebale to be participating in The 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. This year, we are joined by Sentebale youth advocates from Lesotho and Botswana who work to raise the voice of their generation through Sentebale’s Let Youth Lead programme.

The Sohae Satellite Launching station served as the leader\u0027s main rocket launch facility. Located near the northern boarder with China, rockets launched from the site, including the December 2012 launch of a satellite, have been slammed by America as covert ballistic missile tests.  Now, just weeks after Kim Jong-un met with the US president, aerial images appear to show a reduction in activity at the site and dismantled structures, according to think tank 38 North .  The North Korea monitoring site said rail mounted structures have been moved from their long-standing location and the roof a supporting structure has been partly removed.  A large crane was also seen on site, possibly suggesting its use in the deconstruction of buildings at the launch site. Just days after the first aerial images were taken on July 20, it was reported even more dismantling work had taken place. In a report, 38 North said: Since these facilities are believed to have played an important role in the development of technologies for the North\u0027s intercontinental ballistic missile program, these efforts represent a significant confidence-building measure on the part of North Korea. However, while deconstruction work could be underway at the Sohae site, it was previously reported North Korea\u0027s Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Centre was undergoing rapid improvements. Several new buildings, including an engineering office and entrance to an area containing a nuclear reactor, can be seen in the images published by 38 North.

Police are probing claims that a 33-year-old woman was raped by a 19-year-old Irish tourist and a 19-year-old woman was subjected to a sex attack - although she doesn\u0027t remember very much of what happened. The 33-year-old female tourist told officers a man raped her after trying to stop her leaving a room at the BH Mallorca Hotel by grabbing her round the neck. The alleged 19-year-old suspect was believed to be staying at the same hotel as the alleged victim. The second alleged sex assault victim was found naked from the waist up and in a state of shock in a corridor at the Wave House Hotel .  Police say a worker at the hotel heard friends of the suspect, believed to be an 18-year-old Brit staying at the same hotel, tell the woman to \u0027keep quiet.\u0027 She was taken to hospital after the alarm was raised. A spokesman for Calvia’s local police force said: “Police were alerted yesterday morning about a possible sex crime against a 33-year-old British woman staying at a Magaluf hotel. “They were called by a medical centre to deal with a possible case of rape.  “The police were able to track down the suspected sex attacker, an Irishman aged 19 staying at the same hotel, thanks to information the woman provided. “The woman said he had spent part of the night with friends of the alleged victim in a room at the hotel and had forced her to have sex and when she tried to escape, grabbed hold of her and left marks on her neck. “The case has been handed over to the Civil Guard for further investigation. “The local police have also been called upon to deal with a second case involving a British 19-year-old who was found in a state of shock and was hardly able to relay anything about what had happened.

The victim thought she was going to die as her girlfriend smacked her to the floor, dragged her by the hair and brutally beat her up in a car park. She has since declined an offer of money from her attacker and urged police to prosecute. Pimpilai Paksee, 22, had been with female partner Kanjana Sinpraseat, 25, drinking with friends last Thursday night in Bangkok, Thailand. But Pimpilai said the couple started arguing after discovering that she had used a password to protect her messaging app.  Kanjana went to sit alone in the car park of the apartment block before Pimpilai came down just after 1am. CCTV captured the moment Pimpilai tried to reconcile before Kanjana hit her with a motorbike helmet, hurled her to the floor and repeatedly smashed her face into the ground. In a five-minute long attack Pimpilai can be seen cowering on the ground. With blood pouring from Pimpilai\u0027s face, Kanjana then continued the attack as she tried to drag her onto her moped to go home. Shockingly, Pimpilai begged for help from passers-by as several young men - too afraid to intervene - stood watching. A middle-aged female resident eventually arrived back home and stepped in to save her. Kanjana has now been arrested after domestic violence groups became involved and she and faces up to 10 years in prison over the savage attack. Shaken Pimpilai, who is still recovering from the assault having suffered a smashed eye socket and cuts to her face requiring several stitches, said: I was scared for my life, I thought I would die. She would not stop hitting me. I tried to stop her but I did not have the power to fight back. I was not strong enough. I cried and cried and called for help but nobody came.

Even Darren O’Dea has been helping me with my defending and Graham Gartland has helped a lot and every day I’m trying to learn.“If my chance comes I’ll back myself to do the best I can.”Curran came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Stirling last weekend and is hoping to make it appearance No 2 nice and quickly against the Pars on Sunday.He added: “Dunfermline have always been a strong team in the Championship, always competing to get promotion to the Premiership so it will be a good test after they beat Peterhead 3-0 the other night.“There was a great turnout to the Stirling game so, hopefully, we’ll get another good one this weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b115ff16ffe4.jpg ","title":"dundee childminder praised after short notice inspection","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local childminder has been given a positive report by national care inspectors, who said parents were “very happy” with her standards of care.Childcare worker Jane McGinlay was visited by the Care Inspectorate at short notice last month.Inspectors spoke to her and children she was caring for that day and took feedback from parents via questionnaires as part of the assessment.They gave Ms McGinlay scores of “very good” across the board – the second-highest rating.Key among the factors that influenced inspectors were Ms McGinlay’s initial conversations with parents to understand each child’s needs and the preparation of healthy lunches and snacks.A report published following the visit said: “The children were observed to be extremely confident, relaxed and ‘at home’ with the childminder.“It was clear there was a very strong relationship between the children and the childminder which had grown over the years of attending the service.”No formal requirements or informal recommendations were issued.Jane, from Whitfield, said she was “really chuffed” with the findings in the report, adding: “I do this part-time now and we’ve just moved home and downsized, so I was really pleased the inspectors said there was still enough room for the kids to play in.“It’s such a rewarding job and I love it.

I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

That’s fantastic to see.“I gave away a pair of my boots and I think someone had them on running about the streets about 10 minutes later!”Allan Johnston’s Pars side will be looking to spoil Dundee’s return to the newly-named Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park by putting themselves into pole position in Betfred Cup Group D.And Kerr knows the Dark Blues will have to be right on their game to see off a Dunfermline side that swept past Peterhead in midweek.He added: “The game is on the TV as well which is good and the pitch is coming on really well, too. The groundsmen do a great job to give us a good pitch.“It’s always good to come out and have a game on the TV, it’s exciting, but Dunfermline are a side that will definitely try to push this year.“They’ve made some really important signings throughout their side and they’ll be a really tough test, so we’ll have to be firing on all cylinders.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b520462da7b4-e1532336302544.jpg ","title":"host of edinburgh fringe stars coming to dundee for month of live comedy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA host of stars from the Edinburgh Fringe are to descend on Dundee for a month of live comedy.The Icebreaker comedy club is gearing up to welcome some of the top acts from the world’s biggest arts festival throughout August.Among those set to appear include comics who have made appearances in Doctor Who and the Late Show with David Letterman.And the mini-Fringe has been backed by a city councillor who says Dundee could become Scotland’s answer to Chicago.The man behind The Icebreaker, Luis Alcada, has spent the last 18 months building the city’s comedy scene.Monthly open mic spots at The Braes on Perth Road have now been followed by successful Saturday night shows at Henry’s Coffee House in City Square.The Blackness funnyman said: “We’re going to be doing a kind of pick of the Fringe series throughout August which we’re really looking forward to.“We’re finishing a website and a few sketches for The Social on BBC Scotland so there’s quite a lot going on.“So far we’ve got Jamie Diglossia, Gareth Waugh and Matt Hoss who does vegan comedy events down south.“We’ve also got Bethany Black who was in Doctor Who and Al Lubel who was on the David Letterman show a few years ago, so it’s really exciting.“The idea is to go around and pick some shows that I like that will fit in with a Dundee crowd and either book them for one of our Saturday night shows or in one-off shows the last week in August.”Lynne Short, Dundee City Council’s convener of city development, added: “What the guys at the Icebreaker are doing is absolutely fantastic.“I’ve always been in favour of bringing some kind of permanent comedy club to Dundee.“Where better to find a classical comedy night than in a coffee shop in our civic square on a Saturday night?“I’m told the only problem with Dundee acts is keeping them within the five-minute time frame.“The only way to get a night-time economy is to go and support our night-time businesses.“I’d encourage anyone to go along and give them their backing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kharl madianga set to make first dundee start","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith midfielder Glen Kamara expected to be missing for Dundee this weekend, Kharl Madianga is expected to get his first chance from the start against Dunfermline.The Dark Blues host the Pars in Betfred Cup Group D on Sunday with Finnish international Kamara a big doubt after a training-ground clash left him with a protective boot on his foot.The club are hoping the damage is minimal and the use of the boot is purely a precaution.However, it’s unlikely he’ll be risked for the weekend game with Allan Johnston’s side.That means French midfielder Madianga is in line for a first competitive start since signing for the club over the summer.The former French U/17 international joined the club from Bulgarian side Lokomotiv GO – the same side Sofien Moussa was signed from.He made his competitive debut for the Dark Blues last weekend in the 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion, coming off the bench for fellow-new boy Elton Ngwatala.And manager Neil McCann said after that game Madianga was one Dundee fans should look forward to seeing in action.“Kharl came on and showed glimpses as well, he’s a fantastic player so in the midfield I think we have some real exciting talent in there,” the Dens gaffer said.Also missing at the moment for Dundee is winger Roarie Deacon.He’s continuing his recovery from ankle surgery and is expected to be out for a while yet.Club skipper Darren O’Dea missed the win at Stirling last week, and two friendlies in Portugal the previous week, with a groin problem.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man from hull barged into random dundee flat and muttered incoherently","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA “bizarre” incident in which a man from Hull barged his way into a random Dundee flat has cost him £875.Dundee Sheriff Court was told that Thomas Pearman had been accompanying a friend who was working in Dundee, and the pair were staying in a city centre hotel.At around 8.30am on March 25, the flat doorbell rang and complainer Shawn McGouran went to the door, the court heard.She looked through the peephole and saw Pearman “muttering incoherently”.He then began “pushing junkmail through the letterbox”.Fiscal depute Lynne Marrion said: “At that point Ms McGouran opened the door and asked what he wanted.

A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We

residents at Auchterawe near Fort Augustus fear their idyllic homes\u0026rsquo value has been slashed and the peaceful area blighted as the Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) substation expands to become one of the biggest around.\"From a tiny substation it is going to become an industrial site,\" said Steve Lanning who is leading the fight for compensation from SSE.\"For years SSE has been developing the small substation into what promises to become a huge facility. It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me. The other residents are my friends and we are all in the same boat.\"A spokeswoman from SSE said: \"Our proposal has been developed in close consultation with the local community and other stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to allow for enhanced screening and bunding to further mitigate the visual impact.\"We remain committed to working constructively with the local community.\"She added that there have been two public consultations, and SSE also facilitate a dedicated community\u0026nbspliaison group in the area where senior management and project teams are on hand to engage directly with residents to address any concerns raised.A detailed planning application has been lodged and a council planning decision is expected in September.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Our decision will take into account all relevant matters including the potential impact of the development on third parties.\"It is not the responsibility however of local government to provide compensation to third parties who may consider they have been impacted upon by developments as a result of a planning decision.\"Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:35

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

It’s very 50/50.”He added: “From what Aberdeen showed in that game, I think they’ve got all the chances in the world. It’s very possible.“Anything is possible in football.“It’ll be a tough game, for both sides.”Burnley have far more resources at their disposal than the Dons as a result of being in the cash-flooded Premier League.Last season, the Clarets received almost £120 million in television payments for coming seventh compared with the Reds’ £2.3m for finishing second in the Scottish Premiership.The winner in the game Burke played in was scored by Chris Wood – a £15 million signing for Dyche’s team.But Burke thinks Aberdeen starting their pre-season earlier than the Turf Moor outfit, a result of the Scottish top flight returning earlier, could swing things in the Dons’ favour.He said: “Starting their training earlier can maybe give them that extra boost and they’ll maybe be fitter and have had a bit more time.“That could be a big opportunity.”Burke himself is looking to get more playing time under new boss Darren Moore in the Championship this season, having once been touted as Scotland’s answer to Welsh superstar Gareth Bale.The Kirkcaldy native has played five times for Scotland and was at the Toulon Tournament in France as the national team’s Under-21s finished fourth this summer.Burke said: “For me it’s all about getting games under my belt and that’s all I want to do.“I just want to play football and there’s nothing more I want.“Hopefully this season can be my season, as you would say, and I can enjoy myself and get myself back to where I was.“\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"winners of aberdeen v burnley clash to face turkeys istanbul

of customers now using a “cashless” method.He said: “We are working hard to encourage more customers to convert to using mTickets or contactless, as this will have a further impact on reducing boarding times and will help us in the battle to speed up people’s journeys.”The firm has also revealed a new monthly subscription option – the First Bus Unlimited ticket – which also allows customers to pay a monthly direct debit for unlimited bus travel across their chosen network via the mTickets app.Bosses said this is in response to feedback from customers who said options such as the three-month ticket do not allow for periods when they may not need to use it, such as when on holiday.The new unlimited option will allow customers to stop the direct debit and then resume it again.The bus operator normally reviews its ticket prices annually and considers several factors, including rising business costs and the increasing impact of congestion.It said it is “confident” journey times will improve if the trend of more customers using its mTickets app continues, as research by the firm has indicated that boarding times would be 75% faster if customers switched from cash to the mTickets.Earlier this year, a study suggested bus services in Aberdeen were among the most expensive and unreliable in Scotland.The survey, by Citizen’s Advice Scotland (CAS), asked more than 4,600 people across the country what they thought about bus cleanliness, fares, coverage and more.Of the 230 people who took part in the study in Aberdeen, 29% said they were generally dissatisfied with service punctuality, compared to the national average of 56%. And when asked about value for money, 84% of Aberdonians though ticket prices were too costly – compared to a national average of 58%.However, the firm previously said it was “surprised” by the results, which it said were out of line with the regular independent survey carried out by Transport Focus, which has generally shown satis-faction rates in the high 80% region.The changes come into effect on August 5.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners joy as preferred option for north east junction chimes with her own","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA campaigner who has battled for 14 years for a flyover at a notorious north-east junction has expressed joy after a preferred option was revealed.Transport Scotland’s proposals for the £24 million A90/A937 junction at Laurencekirk have gone on display for members of the community.The preferred flyover option replacing the existing junction south of Laurencekirk has been chosen by Transport Scotland.The A937 carries over the A90 on a new bridge with a roundabout either side of the bridge.A link road would provide replacement access to Johnston Lodge and Johnston Mains from the eastern roundabout.The centre and north junctions at Laurencekirk from the A90 would remain open.Three options had been put on display last year for members of the community to have their say on.Campaigners have been calling for a flyover at the A90/A937 road for nearly 15 years.Jill Fotheringham from Laurencekirk, who spearheaded the campaign, got involved in 2004 after a number of deaths on the route.The florist, who has a shop in Montrose, was one of the first in line to see the plans for the route having been outside the Dickson Hall since 10.50am.The 53-year-old said: “After a family came into my shop to get flowers after their young boy died I didn’t want to see another death and I was angry.“So, my thoughts were to get a petition together with a few hundred signatures and hand it in and see what would happen.“I had no idea at the time how big this would become.“I’ve been at this since I was in my thirties.“However, seeing the plans today and to know that the flyover is happening is fantastic.“I’m happy to see it finally coming and mad that it has taken so long.“When I saw the preferred option I was delighted as it is the option that I wanted to happen. It is in the right location.”Exhibition documents said the preferred option has the least impact on the environment, would reduce delays and was the cheapest of the three possibilities.It was announced in January 2016 the road upgrade would be part of £504m of investments allocated to the north-east to improve infrastructure and attract jobs.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: “Having put a number of options for the planned improvements at Laurencekirk on display last year and considered the feedback following the public exhibition, we are now able to let the public see and comment on the preferred option that has been identified for this much-needed upgrade.“The plans on display will help reduce accidents and delays by preventing traffic turning or crossing at the busy A90 junction to the south of the town.“This will be achieved by grade-separating it which will also improve safety and accessibility for all active travel users.“I would encourage as many people as possible to attend the exhibitions to see the preferred option or view the material online and give us their views.“All comments we receive will be considered as we develop the preferred option in greater detail and look to publish draft orders for the scheme in 2019.”Aberdeenshire Lord Provost Bill Howatson, who represents the Mearns, said: “I think this is long overdue and we have been waiting for this for some time, but this is a positive step forward.“It still has to go through due process but with all going well and all boxes being ticked work could start in 2020 or 2021.”Councillor Jeff Hutchison, who represents the Mearns ward, said: “There is still a small consultation to go but I am happy with the junction that has come forward and the residents also seem happy. It is a horrendous junction and this is a step in the right direction and allows the town to move on and plan its future.”Fellow ward councillor Leigh Wilson said: “After speaking to members of the public they appear to be happy with the preferred option.“This is a positive move for Laurencekirk.”Mearns councillor George Carr said: “It will be welcomed by the community. It’s been a long campaign to get the junction to this point.”Another exhibition will take place in the Dickson Hall in Laurencekirk on August 24.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"outdoor table tennis on offer at aberdeen park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWork on installing an outdoor table tennis table at an Aberdeen park has been completed.The concrete table was officially installed in Seaton Park.The project had been in the works for a year, and was pushed forward by the Friends of Seaton Park group.It cost more than £5,000 to fund, with the cost being partly funded through an Aberdeen City Council U Decide grant after the group was successful in applying for money.The table is available for anyone to use and there are also some bats and balls for people to use if they don’t have their own.Sheila Gordon, chairwoman of Friends of Seaton Park, said: “It’s amazing.“It was last year that we got the funding, but it took a while to decide where was best to put the table, and to get people to put it in.”The table travelled up from the south of England, and has been installed near to the car park.Sheila said: “As part of the deal we received some bats and balls as well.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

John got one back at the 11th and then another two at the 12th before a birdie at the 14th pretty much saw him home and dry.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery. It shows Jim\u0026#8217s mother with two girls and appears to have been sent to him after his move to America. Part of the handwriting on the back is obscured but reads: \u0026#8216Hannan\u0026#8217s daughter, mom and myself taken last summer.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Mom\u0026#8217 would refer to Jim\u0026#8217s mum, \u0026#8216myself\u0026#8217 the teenage girl whose age meant she could not be the daughter of Wilhelmina or the sister of Jim. Who was she and was she part of the story which caused Jim to cut himself off from his Scottish roots?If you have any information which could help solve this mystery please email the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial team at editor@argyllshireadvertiser\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"delighted scott reclaims toss title","story":"\t\tJoanne SimmsUpdated: 23/07/18, 12:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowScott Rider is once again World Caber Champion, after he had to toss for it at Inveraray Games on Tuesday.The former Commonwealth Games shot-putter and Olympic four-man bobsleigh team member won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Judges at Winterton Park declared it was too close to call between the Englishman and Peter Bouma from Holland and it was down to a single toss of the caber each to decide the honour.The field of 10 was whittled down to a final five which also included Jamie Gunn, from Falkirk Lukasz Wenta, East Kilbride and Stuart Anderson, Lochearnhead.The event is sponsored by The George Hotel, Inveraray.

Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12945474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_110718WINDOW_01JPG.jpg","title":"ayr window cleaner keith mckissock","story":"NewsAyr window cleaner Keith McKissock says South Ayrshire Council parking wardens are \"stopping\" him from workingFurious Keith McKissock claims he is being \"stopped\" from going about his business in Ayr town centre.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson10:49, 19 JUL 2018NewsKeith has won support from customers and some councillors (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA popular window cleaner claims council bosses are blocking his bid to work. Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Catherine also works in the entertainment industry as a photobooth attendant for Foxy Photo booths. The couple are from Irvine and have two kids together, David, 9, and Darcy, 2. The pair met on a night out in November 2013 in Irvine town. Catherine said: “We exchanged numbers and the rest was history. “We dated for several months before Jamie settled into family life with my little boy David and since then the two of them have been inseparable.” The couple tied the knot on Friday, June 8 at the Gailes Hotel.  “We had a Rugby Glam theme with lots of sparkle,” said Catherine. “We had centre pieces with feathers, rugby balls going down the aisle and silver sparkly table covers. “My son David wrote and shared a reading at the ceremony, which no one knew about, for Jamie about how he has made his mum so happy and how he is proud that this man is his step dad. The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston. The groom and groomsmen wore full kilt attire from Kilts4U in Kilmarnock. The wedding party consisted of Maid of honour, auntie of the bride Anna Marie Darroch Bridesmaid, best friend Emma Sneddon Flowergirl, daughter Darcy Doolan Bride’s parents Luigi and Julie Coppola Best man, best friend Aaron Robertson Ushers, Craig Wilson and David Darroch, Page boy, son David and Groom’s parents Jim Doolan and Una Doolan.  The couple were supposed to have little Cariana Darroch as their second flower girl but she couldn’t make it due to chickenpox! Catherine said: “We were lucky enough that both sets of grandparents looked after the kids and we got a full seven nights in the Luxury Moon Palace Resort in Cancun, Mexico. “We were treated like royalty from the moment we walked off the plane - butler service, 24hr room service, chauffeur driven everywhere. “But, it rained 22 hours a day for almost six days out of seven so we were stuck inside felling like we were at Irvine beach not the Caribbean Coast! Hugh McFedries Photography and Magic Memories Videography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. Flowers were arranged by Myra Craigen @ Balloons and Blooms and their cake created by Not Just Cake, Bellshill. Catherine said: “It was six tiers of white and sparkle- exactly what I had envision on my day. “It was made with different flavours but the Irn Bru and Toffee layers were our favourite.  Hair and Make-up was styled and created by Forever Diamonds, Prestwick Catherine added: “Hair and make up and all things beauty were done by my cousin Sean Diamond’s salon. His team worked very hard to give us exactly what we wanted. “We can not thank all our suppliers enough - but to the venue Gailes Hotel, the effort the staff put in down to every detail and ensuring everything ran on time and smoothly . “Also, our Venue dresser John at LG Wedding and events he made everything look so magical and sparkly, this guy is a miracle worker. “As I work in the industry and have met many brides over time, it was such a strange feeling having the day being about me and having my very own photobooth and marryoke that my boss Marc from Foxy Photobooth provided. “All my guests loved it and the marryoke video ‘She is a belter’ has hit 5k views.” For more photos of Catherine and Jamie\u0027s wedding, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Prestwick Airport were delighted that the UK Space Agency (UKSA) continued to support their plans to be one of the UK’s three horizontal space launch sites. This follows the Space Agency’s announcement that Sutherland will be the UK’s first vertical spaceport, a significant step for the UK space industry. Prestwick bosses believe they are by far the most suitable spot for horizontal space launch in the UK in terms of location, capability and the thriving satellite manufacturing industry that exists on their doorstep. An independent assessment said most of the anticipated infrastructure required for space launch capability is already in place at the site, meaning that they could move speedily to achieve a licence once the legislation is defined. Airport bosses say the development of a spaceport at Prestwick is a real opportunity for the Scottish and Ayrshire economies. The spaceport project is an integral part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal and supporters say it would attract new investment to the aerospace cluster located around the airport, safeguarding existing jobs and creating many new ones. Stewart Adams, chief executive of Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support we have from South Ayrshire Council and look forward to our continued collaboration with them and our other partners as we look to successfully deliver on our joint vision, a vision that places Glasgow Prestwick Spaceport as a centre of excellence for the space and aerospace industries. “We will be having further discussions with all our stakeholders to review our strategy and how to take our plans forward in light of the additional funding available. “We will also be talking to potential customers and launch partners willing to support operations at Prestwick.” South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Prestwick is still the most advanced site currently in the running for the UK’s first horizontal space launch and we’ll seek to use the development fund to cement our position. “Our focus will continue to be on supporting our partners to ensure Prestwick can deliver the significant levels of jobs and investment that we know can be realised.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, said: “The case for Prestwick hosting this facility is a strong one, including the availability of a 2,987m runway and many aerospace businesses already on site with and land to accommodate more.” And MP Bill Grant added: “I am delighted that Sutherland in North East Scotland has been selected for the UKs first vertical take-off Spaceport facility and equally important is the fact that Glasgow Prestwick is still in the running for a Spaceport licence for horizontal take off facilities.” The commercial space sector is worth an estimated \u0026pound3.8billion to the UK economy over the next 10 years.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12953553.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Craig-Ferguson-Promotes-American-On-Purpose.jpg","title":"talk show host holds giant","story":"NewsTalk show host holds giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansionAnd the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:23, 20 JUL 2018NewsStill Game stars Isa, Jane McCarry, and Tam, Mark Cox (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFamed American talk show host Craig Ferguson has staged a giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansion. And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"true-blue-mollie-honoured-on-her-99th-birthday","story":"PEEBLESSHIRE\u0027S longest-serving political campaigner has celebrated her 99th birthday this week.\nAnd Mollie McIntosh, who is also an active of her Walkerburn community, was sent a card and flowers by the Secretary of State for Scotland.\nMollie, who was awarded an MBE for services to her community in 2009 and was named Tweeddale Citizen of the Year the year before, has never allowed age to stop he working for both Tweeddale and her beloved Conservative party.\nBorn and bred in Walkerburn, she became an active member of the Conservatives when she was just 18 years old.\nPaying tribute on her birthday this week was MP David Mundell.\nThe Secretary of State for Scotland said: \"I enjoy saying to Mollie that she is one of our most active \u0027Young Conservatives\u0027 and she still volunteers her services to her local branch at every opportunity.\n\"She\u0027s a remarkable lady who has never missed an election in her adult life, both as a party volunteer and a voter.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

young footballers and their coach, trapped in a cave in Thailand.Their predicament was life-threatening, but a rescue operation was in place.To the delight of everyone and against all the odds, as I write this, all 12 young boys and their coach have been brought to safety.They have been incredibly brave as they endured darkness, cold and hunger, trapped by the threat of rising water if the rains come.The weakest is their coach as he ensured the boys had what little food was available and took nothing for himself.Sadly one of the first divers to go in lost his own life in an attempt to save them, but his skill led the way forward for the rescue plan.I hope and pray that by the time you read this, that they are all home and ready to play football again.They will never forget the courage and the ingenuity of the international team effort to save them and I’m sure the only reward their brave rescuers will want is to know the boys are well.Evidently the boys will be invited to the final of the World Cup itself, and maybe they can dream that one day they might play in this famous tournament themselves.I hope the teams in the final will include England as I wish all my English friends

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

Experts have said rising business rates, a property tax levied on firms, are partly to blame for the pub closures.  According to data from real estate adviser Altus Group, 1,292 pubs have disappeared from the high street, which also means they are not contributing to the Government\u0026rsquos business rates pot.  Retailers and restaurant groups have been affected by similar cost pressures, and have been contending with wage increases, alongside a fall in footfall and consumer spending.  This has triggered a string of high-profile administrations within the sector.  Most recently, Gaucho group collapsed into administration, leading to the immediate closure of the Cau restaurant chain and the loss of more than 500 jobs.  Retailers including Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have also been disappearing from the high street.  David Shuttleworth, vice president at Altus Group, said: \u0026ldquoThe sad reality is that more pubs will continue to call time unless further financial support is provided by the Government.  \u0026ldquoThe Chancellor should be bold within his autumn Budget later in the year by giving pubs a helping hand through an unprecedented stimulus of freezing rate rises in April 2019 whilst increasing the pub discount."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8107949.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-ebay-user-selling-empty-irn-bru-can-for-eye-watering-amount","story":"  The user, believed to be from the Lanark area, is trying to cash in on the can which was issued during the 2014 Commonwealth Games, which took place in Glasgow, and of which maker AG Barr was the lead sponsor.

It\u0027s all Remoaner fantasies and Brussels scaremongering to try to get Britain to submit to the heel of the European Court of Justice and cough up the \u0026pound40 billion divorce bill. Except that this scaremongering isn\u0027t coming from Brussels, but from the British civil service whose job it is make contingencies. And they are right to do so. A no-deal Brexit is looking more and more likely, following the effective demise of Theresa May\u0026rsquos compromise White Paper last week.  Her attempt to remain in the EU regulatory environment by adopting a \u0026ldquocommon rule book \u0026ndash in other words, agreeing to replicate all the terms of our current membership while not actually being a member of the EU \u0026ndash pleased no one. It was condemned as \u0026ldquovassalage by Boris Johnson in his resignation speech, and a \u0026ldquonational humiliation even by pro-Europeans like the former Labour EU Commissioner, Lord Mandelson. The trade bills scraped through parliament last week on the back of a handful of rebel Labour MPs and the indolence of the current and former Liberal Democrat leaders who failed to show for a crucial vote on Monday. But amendments from hard Brexiteers have made May\u0026rsquos White Paper unworkable.  The Scottish Government hasn\u0027t commented on the no deal preparations, but it, too, will have to think the unthinkable. This week the Supreme Court will rule on whether the Scottish parliament had the right to pass a Continuity Bill, seeking to retain control over devolved powers like food, fishing and environment repatriated from Brussels. But this has been comprehensively overtaken by events. The Scottish Parliament was reduced to the status of a parish council last week by legislation that ran roughshod over Holyrood\u0027s legal right to withhold consent if it disagrees with aspects of the new trade agreements. No Sewel convention is going to prevent Scotland disappearing down the Brexit sink hole.  Now, when people talk of a no-deal Brexit they usually mean something like Britain \u0026ldquoreverting to World Trade Organisation terms, or a Canada-style free trade agreement. Wrong. No deal means no deal \u0026ndash it means no trade agreement, no two-year transition period in which things remain largely as they do today. No rights to travel in Europe for work or leisure without a visa, no common standards for medicines, nuclear material or air safety. Everyone will do their best to prevent relations with Europe breaking down completely, and people being hurt \u0026ndash but accidents can happen.  A no deal would be Britain\u0026rsquos biggest economic dislocation since the Second World War. Even a bog standard, free trade deal has to be negotiated and the one struck last week between the EU and Japan took eight years. And even when we have one, it will not be anything like Britain\u0027s current \u0026ldquofriction-free access to the customs union and the single market. There will be tariffs of 10 per cent on cars (so goodbye Nissan and Honda) and 15 per cent on average on food. But much worse will be all the non-tariff barriers to trade: like sanitary and \u0026ldquophytosanitary\" regulations [protective measures against contaminants] which could make much produce unsellable. Service industries, which make up 80 per cent of the British economy will find that they are not automatically authorised to trade in the EU. Banks and financial services will lose their \u0026ldquopassporting rights \u0026ndash though many have already jumped ship.  There will be a hard border in Ireland, or the Irish Sea, because there has to be one, despite what Theresa May said in Ireland last week. No dealers, like the Tory MP John Redwood, insist this is not necessary. \u0026ldquoWe don\u0027t want to set up any borders he says.  This is a new dimension in post-truth politics verging on the theatre of the absurd. The whole point about Brexit was to set up borders \u0026ndash that is what leaving the European Union means. And the UK\u0027s only land border with Europe runs right through the Emerald Isle. It\u0026rsquos 500 km long and has 300-odd crossing points. Moreover the Good Friday Agreement requires regulatory harmonisation north and south. Brexiteers seem to believe that everything will just continue as it does now, and that all those multilateral agreements Britain has entered into over the last 40 years will somehow still apply even as we leave the EU.  Right wing economists like Professor Patrick Minford insist that Britain will be so efficient, freed from Brussels red tape, and so low cost, that we we\u0026rsquoll still be able to flood their markets with our cheap goods and services. But that kind of Vietnamisation of the UK economy is not something that British people are quite prepared for. Brexiteers expect the \u0026ldquoanglosphere \u0026ndash the Commonwealth plus America \u0026ndash to give preferential terms to the UK. But countries like Canada and India are all much more interested in trade deals with the EU, not their former imperial master.  Remain-voting Scotland has been watching the slide to a no deal Brexit with mounting alarm. There was chaos in Westminster last week, as pairing arrangements were abandoned, Tory anti-Brexit rebels were threatened, and a clutch of die-hard pro-Brexit Labour MPs saved the day for Theresa May. It felt like being chained to a lunatic. Every constituency in Scotland voted to remain and the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for Scotland will be dire.  But not nearly as dire as it will be for the future of the United Kingdom.  Descent into no-deal chaos, or even the imminent threat of such, will surely lead to the collapse of the UK Government. Theresa May has been a \u0026ldquodead woman walking, to use the former Chancellor\u0026rsquos phrase, for over a year, and now she isn\u0026rsquot even doing that. With parliament deadlocked, and both the major UK parties opposed to a repeat referendum on Brexit, her departure should mean a General Election, as the Tory party spirals into a state of civil war.  In any General Election against the background of a no deal Brexit we can expect the SNP to return another super-landslide even greater than in 2015. Labour will be condemned for failing to defend the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers, and for Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s refusal even to contemplate a soft Brexit solution involving continued membership of the customs union and single market. The Scottish Tory revival is already stone dead, and the Liberal Democrats are irrelevant. Scots will vote with fury for the party that has consistently opposed Brexit: the SNP. That could mean curtains for the Union, as Scots realise that they made a mistake in 2014. The Tory right better believe it: no deal means no more UK."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-would-plunge-uk-into-state-of-emergency","story":"  Dominic Grieve, the former Attorney General and a leading Remainer, insisted crashing out of the European Union with no deal would be \"absolutely catastrophic\" for the UK.  He said: \"We will be in a state of emergency \u0026ndash basic services we take for granted might not be available.\"  It comes as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab appeared to confirm reports the Government is planning to stockpile food in anticipation of talks breaking down.  He accused the EU of \"irresponsibly\" ramping up pressure in withdrawal negotiations, and confirmed preparations are underway for a no deal outcome.  Official analysis previously warned Scotland\u0026rsquos economy would suffer a \u0026pound12.7 billion a year blow if no deal was struck.  Experts have also raised fears over spiralling food costs, huge queues at the Port of Dover, tens of thousands of job losses and disruption in the supply of medicines.  Kirsty Hughes, director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations, branded the increasingly fraught rhetoric around the possibility of no deal \u0026ldquocompletely insane.  But she said she was still optimistic an agreement will be struck, adding: \u0026ldquoI think no deal is getting more likely, but equally, I don\u0026rsquot think either side want it.  Speaking to the BBC, Mr Raab indicated he was still trying to persuade all members of the Cabinet that Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers compromise agreement was \u0026ldquothe best plan to get the best deal.  He insisted a deal with the EU can be reached by October, but signalled Britain could withhold its \u0026pound39 billion divorce bill if it did not get a trade deal in return.  Chancellor Philip Hammond previously said it would be \u0026ldquoinconceivable to walk away from such an obligation.  Mr Raab also rejected comments from Brussels suggesting a no deal scenario would mean there would be no specific arrangements in place for UK citizens living on the continent, or for EU migrants in Britain after withdrawal.  He told the Andrew Marr Show said: \"Well, I think that\u0027s a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side.  \"We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure.\"  Asked about reports the Government is preparing to stockpile food, Mr Raab at first denied it, but then added: \u0026ldquoThat kind of selective snippet that makes it into the media I think is \u0026ndash to the extent that the public pay attention to it \u0026ndash I think is unhelpful.\"  He insisted it would be \u0026ldquofrankly irrational for the EU to pursue the \u0026ldquoworst case scenario of a no deal outcome.  Former Tory education secretary Nicky Morgan, a leading Remainer, said she believed a majority in Westminster and on the Conservative benches would not accept leaving the EU without an agreement in place.  Meanwhile, former Brexit secretary David Davis urged the Prime Minister to \"reset\" her negotiating strategy and start again.  UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Tory Government appeared to be prioritising \u0026ldquostepping up preparations for a no deal instead of concentrating on negotiations.  He said: \"I just get the feeling that the tail is wagging the dog in the Conservative Party and those that want no deal seem to be ruling the roost and they are pushing for that.\"  The SNP warned a no deal Brexit would betray the interests of ordinary people.  It comes as a parliamentary report said EU citizens granted \"settled status\" to stay in the UK after Brexit should be given physical residency cards to prove their rights, not forced to rely on online checks.  The Commons\u0026rsquo Exiting the EU Committee said Home Office plans to offer EU nationals a digital code to prove their status risked causing confusion, and could even result in people losing access to housing and jobs."},{"url":null,"title":"snps-independence-blueprint-would-have-seen-spending-slashed-by-60bn-report-claims","story":"  These Islands, a pro-UK think tank, insisted the party\u0026rsquos Growth Commission actually strengthened the economic case for Scotland remaining in the union.  Its findings have drawn support from a range of leading economists including Glasgow University professors Ronald MacDonald and Jim Gallagher, Strathclyde\u0026rsquos Professor Brian Ashcroft and Brian Quinn, the former acting deputy governor of the Bank of England.  Opposition politicians insisted the report was \u0026ldquodamning, but the SNP said unionists were \"clearly rattled\" by the boost the blueprint had given to the independence cause.  The SNP\u0026rsquos Growth Commission report, which was led by former MSP Andrew Wilson and published earlier this year, claimed living standards in Scotland could \"equal the best small countries in the world\" within a generation of independence.  Its key recommendations included cutting the country\u0027s deficit and keeping the pound for at least a decade.  But These Islands insisted the Commission had \u0026ldquosingularly failed to make a coherent economic case for independence in fact their work helps highlight the economic benefits of Scotland remaining part of the UK.  It accused the report of tacitly accepting the current austerity policies of the UK Government which it claims to reject.  And it argued that if the Commission\u0026rsquos model for deficit reduction had been applied over the last decade, Scotland would have spent around \u0026pound60 billion less. In 2016/17, public spending would have been \u0026pound8bn lower.  It said the Commission itself had accepted that keeping the pound \"for a possibly extended transition period\" would be damaging to Scotland\u0026rsquos financial services sector, while its report avoided discussing how or when an independent Scotland might qualify for EU membership.  Kevin Hague, chairman of These Islands and the author of the new paper, said it showed \u0026ldquothe SNP\u0027s Growth Commission report is objectively more optimistic than the 2014 White Paper, not more realistic as has been widely claimed.  He added: \"In fact the Growth Commission\u0027s report contains highly misleading analysis, fails to address the key economic questions and \u0026ndash we presume unintentionally \u0026ndash actually strengthens the economic case for Scotland remaining in the UK.\"  His report claims the Commission\u0026rsquos recommendations would be likely to lead to austerity far greater than anything Scotland has recently experienced, or is forecast to experience within the UK.  Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said the analysis showed the SNP \u0026ldquois now making even wilder claims about secession than Alex Salmond did prior to the referendum.  He added: \u0026ldquoQuite simply, they are making it up as they go along.  \u0026ldquoAs everyone apart from the SNP acknowledges, independence would mean cuts on a scale never seen in Scotland \u0026ndash damaging every hospital, school and public service in the country.\"  Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said it was now \u0026ldquoabundantly clear that the SNP\u0026rsquos plans for an independent Scotland would result in austerity cuts that not even [former Tory Chancellor] George Osborne would have dared to implement.  She added: \u0026ldquoIf these proposals were put into practice Scotland\u0026rsquos already under pressure public services would be devastated, with spending slashed on the NHS, schools, and on other vital areas.  But an SNP spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoIf the Growth Commission\u0026rsquos approach had been followed over the last decade, the \u0026pound2.6bn of cuts to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos budget by Westminster would have been completely reversed, with the prospect of additional public spending beyond that.  \u0026ldquoThe commission has kick-started a serious and welcome debate over Scotland\u0027s future, and unionists are clearly rattled by the boost it has given to the independence case, with last month\u0026rsquos Scottish Social Attitudes survey showing that the numbers who view independence as positive for Scotland\u0026rsquos economy now outnumber those who believe otherwise.\""},{"url":null,"title":"demo-tape-features-future-rock-star-david-bowies-first-ever-recording","story":"  Young David Jones had taken up playing the saxophone in a bid to emulate his musical hero, jazz legend John Coltrane. And as he left Bromley Technical High School, the young man who would eventually became a global musical legend had already informed his parents that he planned to become a pop star \u0026ndash prompting his mother to find him a job as an electrician\u0026rsquos mate.  Jones \u0026ndash later, of course, far better known as David Bowie \u0026ndash had already had a taste of performing Shadows numbers with his band, The Konrads, at the school PTA fete, and even cut a demo disc which was promptly ignored by record company chiefs.  What happened later is, of course, musical history. David Bowie\u0026rsquos brief spell as tenor saxophonist and backing vocalist with little-known group The Konrads would be rapidly overtaken by his launch into mega-stardom, while the band\u0026rsquos single recording with the young \u0026ldquothin white duke was destined to be long forgotten.  That is, until now. For David\u0026rsquos Bowie\u0026rsquos first known studio recording has now emerged, 55 years later.  The 1963 recording, which was rejected by Decca Records \u0026ndash infamously, the same record company which turned down The Beatles in favour of The Tremeloes \u0026ndash has suddenly re-emerged after being found discarded in a bread basket.  The demo tape features a youthful 16-year-old Bowie performing I Never Dreamed, which he co-wrote with other members of the band.  The tape, which is expected to fetch \u0026pound10,000 at auction, is part of a trove of memorabilia to be sold by The Konrads\u0026rsquo former drummer David Hadfield, who also managed the band.  He found it tucked in a bread basket that once belonged to his grandfather, stashed in the loft of his garage.  Bowie was originally the band\u0026rsquos saxophonist, however, it was decided that he should sing lead vocals for the tape.  Hadfield said: \u0026ldquoDavid had no inclination to become a singer at this point, his heart and mind were focused on becoming a world-class saxophone player.  \u0026ldquoOur agent, Eric Easton, who also managed the Rolling Stones, asked us to do a demo so he could try and get us an audition at Decca.  \u0026ldquoSo, in early 1963 I booked into RG Jones\u0026rsquo small studio in Morden. In preparation for the demo, David and our guitarist Neville Wills wrote two to three songs. We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song.  \u0026ldquoI chose I Never Dreamed as it was the strongest, the other two were a bit weak.  \u0026ldquoI also decided that David was the best person to sing it and give the right interpretation. So this became the very first recording of David Jones (Bowie) singing 55 years ago.  \u0026ldquoThere is no other recording of the demo featuring David as lead in existence, he adds. \u0026ldquoDecca initially turned us down, but when they gave us an audition later that year, vocalist Roger Ferris was the lead voice and David sang backing harmonies.  Despite the young Bowie\u0026rsquos unique voice and charismatic presence, the group was rejected by Decca and the tape of Bowie singing I Never Dreamed was never released.  Bowie quit the band in the following months, apparently dissatisfied with their choice of pop-style material. While they continued and eventually peaked as a support act for the Rolling Stones, Bowie went on to perform with a succession of other bands until finally finding success six years later with Space Oddity.  Modern digital technology means today\u0026rsquos fledgling stars\u0026rsquo early recordings are unlikely to end up stashed in someone\u0026rsquos loft.  However, recording in the past meant consigning music to master tapes, some of which had a habit of being wiped for new material, or the metal tabs cut up and sold for waste. Even tapes which by today\u0026rsquos standards would be considered \u0026ldquogold dust were destroyed by record companies looking for more storage space or simply lost in fires or thrown out.

The report, to be presented to the UN\u0027s Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women on Monday, makes 27 recommendations for improvements.  It highlights the \"disproportionate\" impact of UK welfare reforms, particularly on disabled, black and minority ethnic women and lone mothers.  SHRC wants Scottish ministers to ensure the problems experienced by women are addressed or mitigated in the development of the new social security system for Scotland.  The report points out that only 26% of public bodies are headed by women, with the gender pay gap reaching nearly 15% when the overall hourly wages of men and women are compared, putting Scotland second from the bottom of the 45 EU member states.  Access to mental health services is also highlighted as a concern, with young women more than twice as likely to be depressed as men.  With those on low incomes, disabled or from black and minority ethnic communities particularly affected, SHRC calls for equal access to services for all women.  The report praises progress made in tackling violence against women, including the recent Domestic Abuse Act, but said further concerted action is needed, particularly in relation to misogynistic bullying and sexual harassment.  It also highlights uncertainty about the implications of Brexit for the protection of human rights and women\u0027s rights, and backs a ban on smacking children.  Commission chair Judith Robertson said: \"Recent campaigns like #metoo have exposed the reality of just how many women experience day-to-day violations of their rights to safety, security and justice.  \"At the same time, women continue to be under-represented in public life, and to bear the brunt of austerity policies, with women from black and minority ethnic communities, disabled women and women on low incomes often experiencing a double or triple-whammy of disadvantage.  \"While the Scottish Government is to be commended for many of its actions to progress gender equality, our latest report to the UN shows that it must now go further, faster, to ensure that all women in Scotland are able to enjoy all of their rights - economic, social, civil and political - on the same terms as their male counterparts.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We welcome that the Scottish Human Rights Commission recognises the significant progress in women\u0027s equality made in Scotland in recent years, including passing the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act, expanding our commitment to free early learning and childcare and establishing an Advisory Council on Women and Girls.  \"We are determined to go further, which is why we are continuing to pursue measures to improve women\u0027s opportunities in the labour market, ensure women are properly represented in decision-making positions, and tackle all forms of violence against women and girls. And we continue to lead by example, with the Scottish Government having one of very few gender-balanced cabinets anywhere in the world.  \"It is deeply worrying that the UK Government\u0027s welfare cuts are having a disproportionate effect on women and hard-pressed families. This year we will invest more than \u0026pound125 million on welfare mitigation and measures to help protect those on low incomes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-200-pipe-bands-to-compete-in-world-championships","story":"  The World Pipe Band Championships are to be held on August 17-18.

For the first time, onshore wind farms on remote islands such as Shetland and Orkney will also be able to compete in the auctions, ministers announced.  The move could deliver up to an additional two gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind per year in the 2020s, to bring total capacity up to 30GW by 2030 from current levels of 7GW in operation, and 7GW in construction or with contracts.  That will be enough to meet more than a third of the UK\u0027s power needs, boosting jobs and cutting costs for consumers, industry bosses said.  The auction system has seen the price for electricity from offshore wind more than halve in just a few years to as low as \u0026pound57.50 per megawatt hour of power.

Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, are said to have been members of the brutal four-man cell of Islamic State executioners in Syria and Iraq, responsible for killing a series of high-profile Western captives.  Along with Mohammed Emwazi - the killer nicknamed Jihadi John - and Aine Davis, Kotey and Elsheikh are thought to have been part of a group nicknamed The Beatles because of their British accents.  Kotey and Elsheikh, who are understood to have been stripped of their UK citizenship, were captured in January, sparking a row over whether or not they should be returned to Britain for trial or face justice in another jurisdiction.  In the leaked letter, obtained by the Daily , Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, told Jeff Sessions, the US Attorney General, that the UK did \"not currently intend to request, nor actively encourage\", their transfer to Britain.  Promising support for the US, Mr Javid said Scotland Yard\u0027s counter-terrorism command had been \"engaged extensively\" on the case with the FBI, with the investigation running for more than four years \"during which time they have engaged with 14 other countries and compiled over 600 witness statements\".  Signalling that the UK was prepared to drop assurances relating to the death penalty, Mr Javid said: \"All assistance and material will be provided on the condition that it may only be used for the purpose sought in that request, namely a federal criminal investigation or prosecution.  \"Furthermore, I am of the view that there are strong reasons for not requiring a death penalty assurance in this specific case, so no such assurances will be sought.\"  But Mr Javid went on to add: \"As you are aware, it is the long-held position of the UK to seek death penalty assurances, and our decision in this case does not reflect a change in our policy on assistance in US death penalty cases generally, nor the UK Government\u0027s stance on the global abolition of the death penalty.\"  The Home Secretary also said US courts were better placed to handle \"foreign fighter\" cases because of the risk of legal challenge in the UK.  Earlier today, No 10 made clear it was the Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquolong-standing policy to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances and it was a matter or principle.  The Prime Minister\u0027s\u0026nbspdeputy spokeswoman made clear Mrs May had been aware that the had been taken by the Home Secretary and the former Foreign Secretary[Boris Johnson] \"following the advice of lawyers and officials and the PM was made aware.  But when asked if the PM had approved the decision,\u0026nbspthe spokeswoman declined to say, simply repeating\u0026nbspMrs May had been \u0026ldquomade aware of the decision.  She stressed: \u0026ldquoIt is everyone\u0026rsquos aim to ensure these men face justice through a criminal prosecution\u0026hellipWe are continuing to engage with the US Government on this issue\u0026hellipWe want to make sure they face justice in the most appropriate jurisdiction, which maximises the chance of a successful prosecution and we continue to talk to the US Government about it.  Yet later No 10 changed its tune. The spokeswoman explained Mrs May \u0026ldquowas aware of these plans and supports the way that this has been handled.  In the Commons, Ben Wallace, the Security Minister, was forced to answer an Urgent Question from Labour on the matter.  He too said Mr Javid\u0027s and Mr Johnson\u0027s decision had the support of the PM. He told MPs:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe Prime Minister was aware of the decision - the decision was made between the Home Office and the Foreign Office - and she agrees.  But the minister caused uproar in the chamber when he told\u0026nbspMPs that seeking death penalty assurances \"might get in the way\" of justice.  In answer to Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat MP who pressed for a fuller explanation, Mr Wallace said: \"Because we are interested in seeking criminal justice in line with international law and where we feel that the assurance might get in the way of being able to do that...if he faced the choice of either having to see these people go free and wander round potentially his city, or indeed go to trial, then of course he may take a different view.\"  The minister was also forced to defend the decision to his own backbenchers - with Tory former Attorney General Dominic Grieve telling MPs the decision represented a \"major departure from normal policy\".  He added: \"Those are the key questions and until they\u0027re answered I have to say to him this issue is going to continue to haunt the Government.\"  Andrew Mitchell, the former Tory Minister, said: \"I have no doubt that [Mr Wallace], who is a distinguished former soldier, would have shot these two people had he engaged them on the battlefield, but these are not comparable circumstances and there are important and longstanding conventions at play here.  \"Will he bear in mind on human rights we cannot distinguish between good and bad people. Human rights are indivisible and belong to everybody.\"  Mr Wallace responded: \"I totally agree with human rights - that is why ministers have acted in line with our legal obligations and indeed taken advice with relation to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that is why, on issues such as rendition, no one is rendering this, the UK Government fundamentally opposes rendition and will continue to do so.\"  Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, accused ministers of \"ripping up\" the UK\u0027s principles.  She said: \"The whole House would agree that those who commit barbaric crimes should be locked away for the rest of their lives, but what the minister has said today is a contradiction of the longstanding abolition of the death penalty strategy.  \"In this case the Home Secretary seems to have unilaterally ripped up those principles on a Friday afternoon in summer.\"  Mr Wallace denied the accusation and told MPs the guidance had been in existence for many years and allowed ministers to \"sometimes seek the ability to share evidence where there is an absence of assurances\".  Tory backbencher William Wragg later urged Mr Wallace to ask Mr Javid to reconsider the move, to which the Minister replied\u0026nbsp\"No.\"  Earlier,\u0026nbspHuman rights campaigners Amnesty International UK also condemned Mr Javid\u0027s decision not to demand an assurance from the US that the death penalty would not be imposed on the two alleged members of the \"Beatles\" group of jihadis.  Allan Hogarth, its spokesman, said: \"This is a deeply worrying development. The Home Secretary must unequivocally insist that Britain\u0027s long-standing position on the death penalty has not changed and seek cast iron assurances from the US that it will not be used.  \"While the alleged crimes of Alexanda Kotey and Shafee Elsheikh are appalling, the UK\u0027s principled opposition to the cruelty of the death penalty isn\u0027t something it should compromise.  He added: \"A failure to seek assurances on this case seriously jeopardises the UK\u0027s position as a strong advocate for the abolition of the death penalty and its work encouraging others to abolish the cruel, inhuman and degrading practice.\"  Emwazi, who was killed in a US air strike in 2015, appeared in a number of videos in which captives, including British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, were killed.  Davis was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organisation and jailed for seven-and-a-half years at a court in Silivri, Turkey, in May 2017.  Mr Foley\u0027s mother, Diane, said she was opposed to the death penalty. \u0026ldquoI am very against that. That would just make them martyrs in their twisted ideology,\" she told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.  \"I would like them held accountable by being sent to prison for the rest of their lives.\"  Lord Carlile, the former reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Mr Javid\u0027s letter was \"extraordinary\".  \"It is a dramatic change of policy by a minister, secretly, without any discussion in Parliament. It flies in the face of what has been said repeatedly and recently by the Home Office - including when Theresa May was home secretary - and very recently by the highly-respected Security Minister Ben Wallace,\" he told Today.  \"Britain has always said that it will pass information and intelligence, in appropriate cases, provided there is no death penalty. That is a decades-old policy and it is not for the Home Secretary to change that policy,\" he added.  The Home Office refused to comment on the leaked document.  But a spokesman said: \"We continue to engage with the US Government on this issue, as we do on a range of national security issues and in the context of our joint determination to tackle international terrorism and combat violent extremism.  \"The UK Government\u0027s position on Guantanamo Bay is that the detention facility should close,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-and-andrea-leadsom-misled-mps-over-pairing-controversy","story":"  Shadow Commons Leader Valerie Vaz said the Prime Minister and Leader of the House fell short of the standards expected of ministers by characterising Chief Whip Julian Smith\u0027s action as an honest mistake.

Ms Vaz, speaking during an urgent question on pairing arrangements, told the Commons: \"The answers and the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House on the 18th July confirmed that the Government Chief Whip was less than candid with his fellow ministers, including the Prime Minister, by not declaring that he actively instructed Conservative MPs to break pairing arrangements.  \"It\u0027s clear that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House have unwittingly misled the House by characterising the Government Chief Whip\u0027s action as an honest mistake.  \"This is a serious breach of the ministerial code.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspChief Whip made \u0026lsquohonest mistake\u0026rsquo in vote pact row, says Cabinet minister  Earlier, Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Alistair Carmichael, asking the urgent question, said he was \"disappointed\" Mr Smith was not responding.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went.

The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me. You don\u0026rsquot know the last time they talk to someone. That\u0026rsquos the nitty gritty of it.\"Smile and say hello, and help them if they need it.

I love it, I\u0026rsquoll moan and groan when it\u0026rsquos snowing but apart from that it\u0026rsquos great.\"My customers are amazing, I\u0026rsquom well looked after and I have good banter with them. I feel like a part of the community here. People bring me stuff all the time \u0026ndash recently I was given a bag of clothes \u0026ndash not all of them fitted me, so I took the rest to a charity shop so they could use them. And recently one of my customers bought me lunch.\"The staff at Tesco always ask how I\u0026rsquom doing \u0026ndash I get on really well with Steve, the manager, he tells me I\u0026rsquom good with the punters.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaTuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

But what are the prospects for such a project, what form might it take, and what would be the political implications?                To help answer these questions, it is useful to consider some historical precedents. On occasions over the last century or so, at moments of national crisis, politicians of the main parties at Westminster have come together to form governments intended specifically to address the threat.            There are three particular examples that stand out. In World War I, a coalition formed first under Herbert Henry Asquith in 1915 and then David Lloyd George in 1916. Then, in 1931, faced with a sterling crisis, the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald collapsed and was replaced by a national government under his leadership. And in 1940, Winston Churchill came to power during World War II as head of a newly formed coalition.            Based on these examples and other aspects of the constitution, a number of observations about the current prospects are possible. First, the most important principle for the formation and maintenance of any government is that it possesses the confidence of the House of Commons (though that need not entail winning every single vote). The House of Commons can, if determined enough, bring about the establishment of a coalition government. And so long as such a government possesses that confidence, it can continue to function.Alternatively – and perhaps more likely – rather than the House of Commons taking a direct initiative, a deal between senior politicians could command that confidence. A national unity government against a no-deal Brexit, then, is plausible in as far as a majority of MPs appear to be opposed to exit without a deal coming about. Indeed, such an administration, if it were backed by all of the “anti-no-deal” MPs, could well enjoy an absolute majority in the House of Commons, unlike the current Conservative government, which is in a Commons minority and reliant on support from the Democratic Unionist Party.READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: New political alliance vital to stop Brexit disasterThe formation of a national unity coalition may also involve an existing prime minister ending one government and forming a new one (as, for instance, MacDonald did in 1931). Alternatively, it may entail a change of prime minister (as when Churchill first came to the premiership in 1940). In other words, this coalition, if it came about, could be led by Theresa May or by someone else. That person might come from the party providing the most MPs (like Churchill in 1940) but need not do so (Lloyd George from 1916 MacDonald from 1931). They could be a party leader (Asquith in 1916) but might not (Churchill in 1940). Much would depend on the circumstances of the time and the personalities involved: who was willing to serve under whom, whether a suitable leader other than the premier was judged to have emerged whether the existing prime minister was regarded as tainted and if so was willing to step down quietly, and so on.Then there is the more problematic aspect: party. The reason a national unity government is being discussed at all is that, though a majority of MPs appear to be opposed to a no-deal Brexit, they are spread across different parties. However strongly they feel about avoiding what they see as a disastrous outcome, they are influenced by other factors as well. The prospects for the formation of any coalition inevitably turn on relations within and between different parties.            Under the adversarial political system of the UK, and given a parliamentary voting system that can often lead to single-party governments, there is a greater resistance to this kind of collaboration than in many other European systems. In the period since 1945, there has been only one full coalition, that of 2010-2015, and it did not include the Labour party so doesn’t qualify as a national unity government.When they have come into being, national unity coalitions have sometimes been associated with serious party political splits, such as that which occurred in 1916 when Lloyd George supplanted his Liberal colleague Asquith as prime minister, or in 1931 when MacDonald opted to form a National government, breaking with Labour.READ MORE: Leader comment: ‘Sensible Party’ must take control of BrexitThe coalescence of the “anti-no-deal” MPs behind a national unity government, either at the request of May or as part of her replacement with a different prime minister, would seem to involve some kind of fissure in at least one of the Conservative and Labour parties. While much would depend on the precise circumstances that triggered such an event, is seems likely that a sizeable proportion of Conservative MPs would oppose the initiative. It’s also unlikely that the present Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would be the figure around whom pro-European Conservative (or indeed Labour) MPs could rally.            A government intended to achieve unity for the UK would therefore involve disunity for both the main parties (though smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats might potentially be able to join with less difficulty, though their recent experience of coalitions might be discouraging). The historical portents are again worth considering here. The Liberal Party was severely divided by the coalitions of World War I, after which it ceased to be one of the two main political parties. Labour was seriously damaged by the split of 1931 created by the formation of the MacDonald National government. Indeed, it took participation in the Churchill coalition from 1940 for it to return to office.The lesson for today would seem to be that national unity governments are difficult to create. And when they do come together, the party political consequences can be divisive, extensive, and lasting. However, if an issue becomes pressing enough, even these considerations can be put to one side.• Dr Andrew Blick is a lecturer in politics and contemporary history at King’s College London.

Take former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, for example. Having backed the Leave campaign in 2016 because he calculated that would maximise the chances of him one day becoming prime minister, Johnson now sits on the back benches, from where he may pontificate about how to solve a crisis for which he is in great part responsible. Last week, days after his resignation from Theresa May’s cabinet, Johnson could be heard to complain that “a needless fog of self-doubt” had descended on the process of departure from the EU.            To those already duped by Johnson, this was stirring, statesmanlike stuff.            It was nothing of the sort. Rather, Johnson’s resignation statement to the House of Commons was stuffed with meaningless platitudes which refused to acknowledge that the EU has every right to negotiate as it sees fit. It boiled down \u2028to a rather Trumpish “make Britain \u2028great again”, with neither detail nor \u2028logic playing any kind of part in achieving this.Throughout the referendum campaign and in the two years since, the Brexiteers’ response to legitimate questions about how exactly departure from the EU might be painlessly achieved has been to fall back on platitudes about confidence, as if somehow “self-belief” will protect sterling and prevent job losses.In Johnson’s cynically constructed fantasy world, if we walk meekly into a lion’s den, we should expect to be mauled to death. But if we hold our heads up and instruct the lion that we’re here to take back control of the den then the beast will roll over in defeat. Oh, and if that doesn’t work and the lion does eat you, well that’s the fault of all those people who told you not to go into its den in the first place. Having failed in the two years since he and Nigel Farage and sundry snake-oil salesmen won the referendum to come up with anything approaching a workable version of Brexit, Johnson took the coward’s way out. He did not resign because of principle (a concept entirely alien to the man), he resigned because he had no idea how to make that victory look like anything other than a spectacular act of national self-harm.May is not, even her fiercest critics would surely concede, a politician in the mould of Johnson. Charged with leading the UK out of the EU, she has to come up with ideas more substantial than “just be confident”. She has to engage with the real world – a real world in which the UK has no cards to play during Brexit negotiations with the EU.            Yet May has begun to show worryingly Johnson-esque tendencies.A call from the Prime Minister for the EU to “evolve” its position on Brexit, for example, is pure Johnson.Support for May’s white paper on Brexit – the document that provided rats such as Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis with the excuse they required to flee the ship they helped sink – would require huge compromise (or evolution) from the EU which would have to be willing to allow the UK to retain the benefits of a trade deal while absolving us of any responsibility to honour the free movement of people or to recognise the jurisdiction of the European Court.Little wonder, then, that the EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has signalled his… let us diplomatically describe them as “concerns” over the document.            According to Barnier, the Prime Minister’s plan for a future trade relationship could weaken the single market and create burdens for business. The white paper, he said, opened the way to a “constructive discussion” but it had to be “workable”.Those labouring under the misapprehension that the EU is in the business of ensuring the UK gets precisely what it wants (whatever that is) will seize on that word “constructive”. They would do better to pay attention to his warning about the things being “workable”.In the febrile atmosphere created by cabinet infighting over Brexit, the fact that the white paper represents nothing more than a series of aspirations is frequently ignored. The arrogant assumption that the EU is obliged to take seriously proposals that would undermine the integrity of the institution might comfort true believers in the Eurosceptic mission but, meanwhile, back on Planet Earth, the reality of a no-deal Brexit looms ever closer.Johnson once said that when it came to Brexit, he was pro cake and pro eating it. A pithy little soundbite, to be sure, but one that assumed the UK could force the EU to make compromises in our favour.It is time, surely, for us to get real about what exactly we can expect from the EU by way of a Brexit deal. And what we can expect is nothing.            Yes, the EU might be willing to give a little here or there but it will only do so when such concessions are in its interests.The European Union will, inevitably, be weakened by the United Kingdom’s departure. This will be welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin along with various nasty little blood and soil nationalists around the word. And that, among other reasons, means the EU will want to do all it can to discourage other member states from leaving.It simply makes no sense for the EU to send a message that says a nation may walk away from the shared responsibilities of membership and then pick and choose what parts of the relationship it wishes to maintain.Countless analogies about divorce or golf club membership have been made in pursuit of driving home this point in recent months yet the ludicrous idea that the UK has cards to play persists.Barnier had said nothing to encourage the belief that the UK can strike a deal on Brexit. Rather, his remarks should remind us that our European partners have more important things to worry about than playing along with the fantasies of right-wing ideologues who insist cake may be both had and eaten."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772508.1532335042!/image/image.jpg","title":"key steps to move from start up to scale up firm","story":"        It has been over two years since the UK made the historic decision to leave the European Union, and the date for our formal exit is fast approaching. On 29 March 2019 \u0026#8211 at 11pm, to be precise \u0026#8211 the country will depart the EU.                 Details of the actual withdrawal process have continued to cause debate, but the \u2028UK government has been looking at how the country can take advantage of the opportunities Brexit may offer, \u2028particularly when it comes to our\u2028 expanding community of start-ups and scale-ups.             It’s true that new businesses have been rapidly springing up across the country – between 2012 and 2017 there were 3.5 million start-ups launched. This is impressive, and the UK government has improved access to finance, encouraging international opportunities for exports, and promoting tech skilled migration.             Collectively, these reforms represent a move to ensure UK SMEs will flourish post-Brexit. However, there exists a fundamental challenge for young companies – transitioning from a start-up into fully-fledged SME. The figures are startling – of all the companies established in the UK in 2013, only a little over half were still in existence by 2017. The challenge, therefore, is not so much encouraging the launch of start-ups, but ensuring they can effectively pass the three-year milestone and become a scale-up.So with that being said, what do entrepreneurs need to keep in mind during the formative stages of their business?Incremental steps You don’t have to look far to find a success story about a UK company that has, for example, raised millions of pounds worth of investment or is preparing to launch overseas. While this can be a strong source of inspiration, it can also compel entrepreneurs to set company milestones that are simply unattainable. No business model is perfect, which is why different elements of a start-up’s service or product needs to be tried, tested and refined in accordance with the demands of the market. This is known as pivoting, and as per the evolution of the business model, targets must also remain realistic.            Ultimately, growth needs to be measured through regular and achievable targets, helping to reduce the risks and costs involved in a decision should it fail to deliver the desired results. At these critical early stages, it is important to minimise risk and not expose the business to any unnecessary challenges. Take advantage of incubator and accelerator programmesThe time, money and stress involved in getting a business off the ground can take a huge toll on an entrepreneur. As a result, feelings of isolation and loneliness can be all too common and it is important that any business leader develop a proper understanding of the instruments available to support their growth. Thankfully, the UK boasts an extensive network of incubator and accelerator programmes offering guidance and mentorship, not to mention a fantastic forum to connect with like-minded entrepreneurs. When it comes to incubator programmes in particular, early-stage companies can form valuable connections with investors who are not only interested in investing, but also serving on the board to help with the strategic guidance of the business.             Take advantage of existing technologyDigital innovation is rapidly changing the way in which consumers and businesses interact, and now, demands and expectations for products that have an effective tech component are high. A survey of 2,000 UK adults by Studio Graphene recently found that half of consumers will leave a business’ website in just 30 seconds if it’s ugly or hard to navigate. Moreover, 24 per cent of the respondents said that in the past five years they had switched loyalty to a firm whose technology delivers a better customer experience.Having a strong business concept is one thing, but ensuring it is accessible and meets the demands of the market requires equal attention – a start-up must constantly strive to improve its offering. This doesn’t have to be an expensive venture and useful technologies are now highly accessible. Rather than always looking to create new solutions from scratch, many successful start-ups harness existing technologies. This will save a company time and money, helping to complement the resources already invested by a start-up in its own proposition.             The UK’s entrepreneurial future looks bright, and with local companies now at the forefront of disruption across established and emerging sectors, there is a need to ensure more entrepreneurs can transform their start-up into a scaling and profitable entity. Following these pieces of advice will help business leaders avoid common pitfalls that damage a start-up’s chances of success in turn this puts them in a stronger position as the UK heads for Brexit and beyond.

It is suggested that early friendships among members of the Scottish emigrant communities in Canada first stimulated his interest in Highland history. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain as an adult but left after the end of the Second World War. However, Prebble never lost his hostility to the human impact of market capitalism or sympathy for its victims.            Many scholars have rubbished The Highland Clearances as a work of faction, or a fusion of fact and fiction, rather than a serious history. Predictably the book rarely features in the prescribed reading lists of Scottish universities, except perhaps as an exemplar of partisan historical interpretation. I recall a colleague once setting students the essay question: “Prebble’s The Highland Clearances is not good history but it is a good novel. Discuss.”But most readers seem not to care about the ferocious criticisms which the volume has sometimes attracted from members of the academy it continues to sell well long after his death. For the general public, Prebble tells a compelling story in very readable prose presented as a dramatic saga of betrayal, loss, tragedy and forced exile of the Highland clans from their native glens which in his interpretation remain empty to this day as silent memorials of man’s inhumanity to man.The author makes his own position perfectly clear from the outset: “This is the story of how the Highlanders were deserted and then betrayed. It concerns itself with people, how sheep were preferred to them, and how bayonet, truncheon and fire were used to drive them from their homes.” The book is an accessible and fluent read, in part because the author does not even try to come to grips with any of the many challenging complexities of Highland history. Those in the dock are always the former chieftains of the clans, by the later 18th century transformed into commercial landlords, whose greed, Prebble insists, led them to sacrifice their erstwhile clansmen for filthy lucre. At root, indeed, the volume is concerned with a classic struggle between the forces of good (the defenceless people of the Highlands) and evil (the brutal landlords and their callous lackeys, the notorious factors – estate managers – of ill fame). Prebble’s perspective on clearances had been fashioned by almost a century of earlier polemic, political and fictional writing which stretched back into the Victorian era. Most of the documentation in the book relies on these earlier works with little evidence of original research by the author. Almost all of this passionate oeuvre was produced at the height of Victorian controversies about clearances between the 1840s and the 1880s. It was deeply sympathetic to the people who had been displaced, strongly supportive of the vital need for land reform and bitterly hostile to what was seen as oppressive and brutal landlordism.            It was significant too that The Highland Clearances achieved bestseller status in Scotland during the late 1960s and 1970s, when the country first began to experience the early stages of deindustrialisation and rising levels of unemployment as the postwar boom petered out and the old imperial connections which had sustained the great heavy industries faded into the past. As the country started to move politically to the left, the history of the evictions became a symbol for the emerging tragedy of an economy in decline, the social impact of deindustrialisation sometimes being described as a modern clearance.This was also the time when Scottish nationalism finally achieved some electoral purchase with Winnie Ewing’s famous victory in the Hamilton by-election of 1967. Nationalism, clearances and victimhood soon became intimately linked by some polemicists, a tendency which has continued to the present day through the proliferation of social media. The contentions were that the historic tragedy of the Gaels had taken place during the Union and sometimes also, against all the evidence, that English landowners and sheep farmers were mainly responsible for the draconian acts of eviction.Prebble himself never claimed to be a historian and always referred to himself as a historical writer. He seems to have been taken aback by the storm of criticism generated in some circles by his book, especially by the intervention of the late Professor Gordon Donaldson, a former Historiographer Royal,who bitterly denounced Prebble’s work on the Highlands as “complete rubbish”.Some thought the furore simply reflected jealousy on the part of an academic establishment whose works might be scholarly and rigorous but could never hope to achieve a fraction of Prebble’s sales. It is also fair to say that he had tackled an important and controversial subject which most historians up until that time had studiously ignored or consciously avoided. But scholars were also right to be concerned that a book which some of them believed to be riven by bias and distortion, as well as being under-researched and devoid of much critical perspective, was widely accepted by the public as the authentic chronicle of clearance.             There is indeed still much to be said about this controversial and emotive subject. In my new book The Scottish Clearances, which will be published later this year, I return to the saga of the dispossession of peasant communities, not just in the Highlands but throughout Scotland between 1600 to 1900. Based on four decades of research, writing, teaching and reflection I see it as my most ambitious and challenging project to date.Sir Tom Devine is Sir William Fraser Professor Emeritus of Scottish History and Palaeography in the University of EdinburghThe Scottish Clearances: A History Of The Dispossessed 1600-1900 will be published by Allen Lane: The Penguin Press on 4 October at £25.00"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762173.1530449288!/image/image.jpg","title":"stagecoach to trial driverless bus that could transform travel","story":"        Perth-based Stagecoach has announced plans to trial a driverless bus.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nTuesday 24 Jul 2018 3:39

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

She has been a tower of strength since her diagnosis and during her time in America and we are so very proud of her.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866187.jpg--.jpg?1531813044000\n","title":"kittens get new home after being found by passer by","story":"  \nFOUR kittens have been rehomed after they were dumped at the side of the road in Portglenone.\n  \nThe black and white kittens were found in a box behind a hedge by good samaritan, Darren McFetridge.\n  \nDarren had been out on Thursday evening (July 5) walking his dogs around 7pm in Portglenone Forest.\n  \nHe went into the forest with his two dogs and around half an hour later when he was returning to his car he saw two of the kittens wandering around the road.\n  \nSpeaking to the , Darren said he immediately started looking for more kittens.\n  \nOn closer inspection he found two more kittens in a box behind the hedge.\n  \nThe cardboard box they were in seemed fresh as if it hadn\u0027t been there that long, Darren explained.\n  \n\n  \nDumped\n  \n\n  \nI think whoever dumped the kittens has possibly done it in the time that I was in the forest because I would have noticed them on my way in.\n  \nI think it is really sad that people will do this to poor, defenceless animals. \n  \nIt would have taken the person five minutes to bring them to a vets and they would have been rehomed without a shadow of a doubt.\n  \nDespite the kittens being left at the spot on the Gortgole Road they appeared to have been unharmed and \u0027perfectly healthy\u0027.\n  \nDarren waited on a friend to come and meet him where he found the kittens so they could transport them to Parklands Vets.\n  \n\n  \nRehomed\n  \n\n  \nThe vets confirmed to the Ballymena  that all four kittens were rehomed by the following morning.\n  \nA staff member at the vets said: All the kittens were perfectly healthy and they have now gone to a good home.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866293.jpg--.jpg?1531813307000\n","title":"ballymena nursery gets a gold star report","story":"  \n BALLYMENA Nursery School has received a glowing report by the Education and Training Inspectorate (Eti).\n  \nThe report gave the nursery school the highest award for overall effectiveness with “a high level of capacity for sustained improvement”.\n  \nIt follows an inspection of the nurserys at Trostan Avenue, Ballymena which was carried out on April 26.\n  \nIn the report the inspectors commented that the nursery school leadership “understand fully the changing needs of the children and wider community”.\n  \nJust last year the nursery school celebrated its 50th anniversary with a community party.\n  \nAs it sits on the site where Ballymena Castle once stood, the celebrations involved a “castle theme” with knights, princesses, court jesters, balloon modelling and face painting.\n  \nThe inspectors also commented that parent\u0027s written comments “praised the staff\u0027s dedicated professionalism and care in meeting the children\u0027s individual needs” and highlighted the nursery\u0027s positive reputation within and contribution to the community.\n  \nThe staff comments “endorsed the supportive and productive working relationships at all levels and the caring and positive strategic leadership of the principal”.\n  \nThe inspectors reported that both indoors and outdoors, the staff provide a “stimulating, richly resourced and well organised learning environment the wide range of authentic and natural resources and displays are easily accessed by the children to progress their self-reliance and to promote their active interest”.\n  \nThe inspectors also commented: “The children\u0027s personal, social and emotional development is a key strength.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"}]
