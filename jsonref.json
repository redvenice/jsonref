The course is public, and has the support of much of the community If commissioners approve, voters would decide on Nov. 6 whether to change the city\u0027s charter and allow what would be a no-bid deal to lease 73 acres at the Melreese site to the group. The deal Beckham is proposing calls for the city to collect nearly $140 million in rent payments over 39 years, a rate of roughly $3.5 million annually.PICTURE EXCLUSIVE: David and Victoria Beckham look VERY...\u0027When they win, lets see what David Beckham tells me!\u0027...Share this articleBeckham\u0027s group would pay an additional $20 million over 30 years to help fund a planned 58-acre park on the site.The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star and business partner Jorge Mas are listed on the city\u0027s agenda for the July 12 meeting, described as scheduled to make a \u0027personal appearance\u0027 and \u0027special presentation.\u0027 They will ask commissioners to put the measure before voters, though it\u0027s certain that not everyone at the meeting will be supporting the idea.Petitions are circulating to save the course, where Tiger Woods has appeared for clinics in the past. Longtime LPGA star Cristie Kerr, a Miami native, has voiced opposition to the Melreese plan in recent months, as has fellow Miami native pro Erik Compton.\u0027Please help protect this beautiful green space, this public golf course and this home to amazing youth programs,\u0027 Compton wrote on Twitter .          Longtime LPGA star Cristie Kerr, a Miami native, has voiced opposition to the Melreese plan          David Beckham briefly played with the L.A. Galaxy, but could have a larger impact on the MLS as an owner, whenever his expansion franchise does eventually take the field Beckham\u0027s group also wants to bring a massive technology park to the site, as well as an underground parking facility, public soccer fields, 500 new hotel rooms, a conference center, retail stores, restaurants and more. The Beckham franchise, when it gets going, will also bring a training center and an academy focused on developing local players to the Miami area.The stadium-location quest is just the latest drawn-out chapter in Beckham\u0027s five-years-and-counting marathon to bring MLS back to Miami. The Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, folding because of poor attendance.Beckham and MLS announced in January that the franchise would be coming to Miami, but nearly every detail about the club remains unclear. There\u0027s no definitive start date - 2020 has been mentioned repeatedly, even though no new stadium could possibly be ready by then - as well as no team name, no logo, no colors, no coaching staff and no front-office personnel.More than a year ago, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a deal to sell Beckham nearly three acres of county land for $9 million with the belief that it would be the last parcel he needed for a stadium site in the city\u0027s Overtown neighborhood. But that site was never the preferred choice for Beckham and his group anyway, with the original hope being to build on the waterfront near the Port of Miami.The Overtown site now seems all but doomed, though it\u0027s unclear what would happen if city commissioners or voters block the latest Beckham plan.          Beckham preferred a site near the Port of Miami, but traffic from the port\u0027s bridge and from American Airlines Arena - the home of the Miami Heat - made the intersection unusable    In this January 29, 2018, file photo, David Beckham speaks at an event where it was announced that Major League Soccer is bringing an expansion team to Miami. Beckham\u0027s latest soccer plan for Miami might be decided by the city\u0027s voters. His target: A golf course. Beckham is scheduled to appear before the Miami city commission next week, as he and his partners aim to move closer to picking a stadium location for their Major League Soccer franchise"},{"url":null,"title":"London Pride 2018 Starbucks celebrate Glitter Frappuccinos","story":"Pornhub has UK drill videos on its site despite campaign to remove themAnt-Man and the Wasp star Evangeline Lilly had retired from acting before The HobbitThe Bachelorette finale: All you need to know about the season 14 finalePamplona bull run 2018: All you need to know about San Fermin\u0027s Running of the Bulls festivalITV to launch Absolutely Ascot in bid to rival Made in ChelseaThe rules Meghan Markle has to follow but Princess Eugenie and Beatrice don\u0027t revealedLondon Pride 2018: Starbucks to celebrate with Glitter FrappuccinosPaul McCartney tour: Freshen Up UK tour dates, tickets and venuesTour de France 2018: All you need to know about the 105th editionNational Lottery results: Lotto draw for Wednesday, 4th JulyWorld Cup 2018: Bank of Russia jokes it predicted Russia\u0026#8217s victory over Spain on special currencyCalum Best calls for Love Island bosses to have more focus on mental health supportEngland vs Sweden football history revealed ahead of 2018 World Cup fixture on SaturdayPrince Louis christening: Who will Kate Middleton and Prince William invite?EuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 3rd July 2018 drawWhen Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealed"},{"url":null,"title":"Pamplona bull run 2018 need know San Fermins Running Bulls festival","story":"The groups said in a press release that they ‘understand the indignation’, but that it ‘cannot be used as an excuse to exploit our fight to make simplistic analyses’.‘Focusing on just one case makes the rest of the other assaults invisible, it undermines their importance and highlights elements that have little to do with reality,’ the statement read.‘All assaults are important, all women who suffer or who have suffered from aggression need our solidarity, and no assault, be it of high or low intensity, can be justified.’Other protests have been organized to share anti-bullfighting sentiments.Aida Gasc, director of AnimaNaturals in Spain, told Euronews: ‘All the bulls that participate in the morning in the runs are driven directly in the afternoon to the bullring where they’ll be tortured to death.‘That’s something that most people don’t know and that’s where the greatest and most bloody animal abuse at this kind of show happens.’ Pornhub has UK drill videos on its site despite campaign to remove themAnt-Man and the Wasp star Evangeline Lilly had retired from acting before The HobbitThe Bachelorette finale: All you need to know about the season 14 finalePamplona bull run 2018: All you need to know about San Fermin\u0027s Running of the Bulls festivalITV to launch Absolutely Ascot in bid to rival Made in ChelseaThe rules Meghan Markle has to follow but Princess Eugenie and Beatrice don\u0027t revealedLondon Pride 2018: Starbucks to celebrate with Glitter FrappuccinosPaul McCartney tour: Freshen Up UK tour dates, tickets and venuesTour de France 2018: All you need to know about the 105th editionNational Lottery results: Lotto draw for Wednesday, 4th JulyWorld Cup 2018: Bank of Russia jokes it predicted Russia\u0026#8217s victory over Spain on special currencyCalum Best calls for Love Island bosses to have more focus on mental health supportEngland vs Sweden football history revealed ahead of 2018 World Cup fixture on SaturdayPrince Louis christening: Who will Kate Middleton and Prince William invite?EuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 3rd July 2018 drawWhen Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealed"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/09/4DF80C4700000578-0-image-m-6_1530866747803.jpg","title":"Swedens WAGS stay hotel ENGLAND team","story":"    Swedish WAGs like Maja Nilsen (pictured) wife of Man Utd\u0027s Victor Lindelof are staying at the Renaissance with the England teamEngland\u0027s players will be staying in the same hotel as the Swedish WAGs ahead of tomorrow\u0027s World Cup quarter final, MailOnline can reveal.Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying.But the Swedes are bragging they already have the edge after they were booked into Samara\u0027s only five-star resort - leaving England in a more modest four-star hotel. Sweden\u0027s FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027  His countrymen are in the Lotte Hotel, which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area.   The hotel\u0027s sumptuous  fine food menu lists the amount of calories contained in each item for weight watchers -

So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off. We beat Portugal last year in a friendly.

But we go in to the quarter final in a very good mood.\u0027  The Swedish delegation have been privately meeting human and civil rights leaders in Russia and supporting their work. Mr Sjostrand added: \u0027 England have so many good players and they should beat us. But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.    Despite Sweden claiming victory in the battle of the hotels, Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be hoping for a repeat of their heroics when they beat Colombia on Tuesday (pictured)\u0027I am a Manchester United supporter and one of my daughters is called Ester because of Manchester.\u0027 I also follow Ashley Young , Rashford and Lingard. England have so many good players.He said he expected between 1000 and1500 fans to be in the Samara Arena on Saturday evening to be supporting Sweden.He added \u0027To come here is a challenge because of a lack of flights and it is really expensive.\u0027We had 500-6000 people at our last match because it was in St Petersburg and it not so difficult to travel from Sweden. People came by car and by train through Finland.\u0027We hope for a great match and of course a Swedish victory.

We believe it to be one of his earlier watercolours.\u0027          Libby Sheldon, pictured, agrees the painting is a genuine TurnerMs Archer-Thompson revealed that cross-border cooperation had resulted in the lost Turner coming to light.She said: \u0027The private collector of the lost Turner watercolour is English.We met him through a Scottish connection, who is another art collector.\u0027\u0027I first saw the painting in March at the collector\u0027s private residence.\u0027He bought the painting a few years ago but has been researching it because he wanted to find out more as he thought there was something special about it.\u0027I knew it was a genuine Turner. I was completely moved when I held it in my hands. It is something to hold it in your hand rather than behind a glass, which is great about my job. This is probably the highlight of my career.\u0027The private collector paid peanuts for it - a two-figure sum - only for a national gem to be discovered.\u0027Extensive archival research was undertaken to build up a case for why this was a genuine Turner painting from his life and time at Abbotsford.Her role was using her expert knowledge in the subject to help the owner unravel the story behind the painting of Scott\u0027s home. Combining that with the scientific study of the painting has enabled Ms Archer-Thompson to make the case.Ms Archer-Thompson is convinced it is a Turner because a pencil sketch, which can only be seen by infra-red imaging reveals the artist\u0027s original sketch. This has been adapated and changed siginficantly in the paint.The type of paper used for the watercolour also matches Turner\u0027s use of materials but the main focus was on the date of the frame and the paint.The scene of the Tuner painting is also found in the engraved commemorative book after Scott\u0027s death.Ms Archer-Thompson added: \u0027Not very long ago another lost Turner watercolour appeared and was sold for £230,000.\u0027The tiny watercolour, which is poket sized, measures at 5.5 inches by 3.5 inches.Libby Sheldon, a painting analyst expert, \u0027supports the theory\u0027 the Turner is a genuine.Ms Archer-Thompson, added: \u0027All of this analysis, including work by painting expert Libby Sheldon, demonstrates that it was executed by an astonishingly skilled hand.\u0027          The painting is believed to have been painted at the Scottish home of Sir Walter Scott, picturedWhen Turner stayed at Scott\u0027s house in August 1831, the writer showed the renowned painter his art collection, amongst which is believed to be a view of Abbotsford and the River Tweed by Scottish artist Elizabeth Nasmyth.Ms Archer-Thompson said: \u0027This painting is from exactly the same vantage point we believe Turner painted.\u0027Scott had a personal attachment to the Nasmyth painting and its composition and my theory is that this gave Turner the idea to compose the same scene, which he based on sketches in the Abbotsford sketchbook used during his visit in 1831.\u0027Abbotsford House Trust chairman James Holloway, a former director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, added: \u0027It is wonderful for Abbotsford to be able to show such a fascinating painting.\u0027It will intrigue and delight our visitors.

Players, such as Dele Alli, have models as girlfriends — in his case one who specialises in lingerie.These are lifestyles and behaviour utterly alien to the wives of 1966.The Football Association even excluded them from the victory champagne reception at London’s Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. Instead, the wives — and one fiancee — dined separately in the chop house upstairs. Their husbands came up to collect them at around midnight.Kathleen Peters, the wife of midfielder Martin Peters, said: ‘We were overwhelmed and just sat in the hotel room, staring at his medal like two kids. We didn’t even drink champagne — I think I made us a cup of tea.’One wife was absent, Jack Charlton’s wife Pat, who — now 83 — likes to joke that she is the ‘oldest WAG in the world’.She watched the World Cup Final on a black-and-white TV in her modest semi-detached house in Leeds with her mother. ‘Of course we were very proud of them, but we were not involved like the wives and girlfriends are these days at all,’ she says.          WAGs on a night out in St Petersburg. From left: Millie Savage, Gemma Acton, Megan Davison, Becky Vardy, Annabel Peyton, Fern Hawkins, Shannon Horlock, Annie Kilner and Lucia LoiLike current England captain Harry Kane’s fiancee, Katie Goodland, Pat was pregnant and opted to stay at home for medical reasons. ‘I watched it at home because I was about to have a baby. I already had two children.‘I wanted to go to the final, but the medical advice was against it and you don’t want to go into labour in the middle of the World Cup Final at Wembley.’She adds: ‘I know that some of the girls were upset because after the final they could not sit with the husbands but had to go into another room for dinner. They felt it was not right, stuck in a different room, like you are nothing. But that was the way it was.’Pat, married to Jack for 60 years, remembers he rang her about an hour after the match, and came home the next day — stopping at a transport cafe for a plate of egg and chips.The separations while the tournament was on were hard, she said. ‘They would go off for two or three weeks before the World Cup and you wouldn’t see them.’But that was the way England manager Alf Ramsey insisted that it should be. He didn’t want his players to have any contact with their wives — they were allowed phone calls and letters only.Patricia Hunt, who was orced from Roger in 1981, explains: ‘We had a very different relationship with the management. They kept the wives and families at a distance. We were definitely not involved or invited. Our role was not even considered.’She seems astonished that one of this year’s players, Fabian Delph, returned from Russia to the UK to be with his wife for the birth of their third child.‘If that had happened in Alf Ramsey’s day, he would have said: ‘‘Go home...and don’t come back after.’’ It would not even have been considered a possibility.          Roger Hunt and wife Patricia pictured a few weeks after England\u0027s triumph in the 1966 final‘Football is not just a game any more,’ says Pat. ‘The money they earn, the cars they drive, the mansions they live in and the lifestyles they lead are totally different from the way it was for us.’This much is true — the England team were paid a tiny fraction of current wages.Martin Peters earned around £120 a week at Tottenham (the equivalent of £1,770). Harry Kane, who plays for the same club, is on £200,000 a week.Pat Hunt says: ‘We were ordinary people. Your husband was playing a game of football, but it was no big fuss made. I would have hated to have been looked at and analysed and watched as the WAGs are, but now it’s all big money and celebrity.‘Rebekah Vardy flies out with all the family on a private jet, then she’s on the telly on Loose Women and is out until 3am or 4am, and it’s all about publicity.‘I suppose they do it and absolutely love it, and good luck to them, if they can handle it.’Tina Moore, married to 1966 England captain Bobby until 1986, agrees. ‘We didn’t have anything like their money, but we did have a wonderful life. Would I like to be a WAG today? I don’t know, to be honest. My husband was handsome and charismatic, but you never had too much concern (about predatory female rivals).‘Nowadays it’s horrendous — women pursue footballers because they know that they could end up with a great lifestyle. I wish them luck with it.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/22/4DFC4C5100000578-0-image-m-24_1530912356885.jpg","title":"Harry Kane vows make nation proud","story":"    Captain Kane pledged to make the nation proud as England take on Sweden at the World Cup          Harry Kane told fans today that he hopes his team will provide more jubilation this afternoon   England\u0027s tournament run in Russia has sparked scenes of wild celebration back at homeEngland’s tournament run in Russia has sparked scenes of wild celebration back home and Kane, 24, hopes the team will provide another cause for jubilation by reaching their first World Cup semi-final for 28 years.Kane said: ‘After the games we always see the videos on social media.

I don’t mind either way. Obviously I am a tennis player, so I am here to do my job first.‘Hopefully it will be a success for both of us, England and myself.’One solution would be to start Edmund’s match at 5.30pm, by which time the England game should be over even if it goes to penalties.Many wedding parties are also anxiously wondering whether they will be able to see the match.          Kane, pictured at school, said he wanted to see more footage of fans celebrating after the gameGeorge Morey, 25, and his soon-to-be bride Aimee, 24, have managed to secure a screen for their wedding reception at a golf club in Swanley, Kent.He said: ‘There’s certainly been some heated debates about the game but she’s come round to the idea of it now.

More than 80 per cent of homes in Jonkoping, in the province of Smaland, use them.During their dark winters, with snowfall which can last up to eight months, the Swedes become introverted and prone to depression. But come the pagan festival of Midsommar, they decorate maypoles with flowers, party like it’s 1999 and stay up all night before hurling themselves into lakes, rivers, saunas . . . and other people’s beds.Sweden is nearly twice the size of England, has a population of just 9.9 million (compared to our 54 million) and boasts roughly 3.1 billion trees.

It lasted six days. Excitement reached fever pitch as the crew negotiated all 58 locks.They love living the lagom way.

However, Hiba’s father is unsure. And her mother is very much against her daughter marrying such a close relative because her own first marriage — to a cousin — ended in orce.Hiba, single and a student at the University of Leeds, faces a common dilemma. Her story came to public attention because she featured in a BBC documentary called Should I Marry My Cousin?, which looked at the custom of cousin marriage.Relationships described as ‘consanguineous’ are those between couples who are at least second cousins or more closely related. The practice has been legal in Britain for more than 400 years, but is considered one of society’s last taboos.In British Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, marriage between cousins is designed to strengthen the family and keep wealth intact.But there are massive health risks involved for the children of such couples. And when they are tragically born with disabilities, it is taxpayers who are left to pick up the huge costs of their NHS treatment, which can run into millions over a lifetime.Pensioner, 70, has been missing from his £1.2million farm...Larissa Beilby\u0027s accused killer \u0027put a loaded gun in the...Share this articleNew official figures shown to the Mail reveal a worrying picture across England. Shockingly, cousin marriages are a key factor in an average of two child deaths every week.This figure is derived from the fact that a total of 545 boys or girls born to closely related couples have died in childhood during the past five years, according to the Department for Education, which collates data from Child Death Overview Panels in every council area. (It is the job of these panels to examine the deaths of any child under the age of 18.)Thousands more children of consanguineous marriages survive, but with appalling physical or mental problems. These include blindness, deafness, blood ailments, heart or kidney failure, lung or liver problems and a myriad of often incurable and complex neurological or brain disorders.According to a report for the BBC’s Newsnight, British Pakistanis are 13 times more likely to have children with genetic disorders than the general population.They are responsible for three percent of all births, but produce just under a third of all British children with such health problems.In Birmingham, around one in ten children from first cousin marriages either dies in infancy or develops a serious life-long disability caused by genetic ailments, according to health officials in the city, where half the mothers of Pakistani origin are married to a close relative.Meanwhile, a research document by the NHS-funded Enhanced Genetic Services Project reveals that in Birmingham in 2009-2010, the combined infant stillbirth and death rate ‘definitely or probably’ due to genetic disorders inherited from Pakistani cousin parents was 38 times higher than that among white European babies in the city.The report — one of the most thorough into this health and social problem — says: ‘Almost a third of the affected children die before five years of age.Most of the survivors suffer chronic disability, and they are cared for by their families, posing tremendous emotional and financial strain.’Up in Bradford, where teenager Hiba Maroof lives, doctors and nurses have told me paediatric wards look after numerous children who are unable to speak, and are fed through tubes.

We believe it to be one of his earlier watercolours.\u0027          Libby Sheldon, pictured, agrees the painting is a genuine TurnerMs Archer-Thompson revealed that cross-border cooperation had resulted in the lost Turner coming to light.She said: \u0027The private collector of the lost Turner watercolour is English.We met him through a Scottish connection, who is another art collector.\u0027\u0027I first saw the painting in March at the collector\u0027s private residence.\u0027He bought the painting a few years ago but has been researching it because he wanted to find out more as he thought there was something special about it.\u0027I knew it was a genuine Turner. I was completely moved when I held it in my hands. It is something to hold it in your hand rather than behind a glass, which is great about my job. This is probably the highlight of my career.\u0027The private collector paid peanuts for it - a two-figure sum - only for a national gem to be discovered.\u0027Extensive archival research was undertaken to build up a case for why this was a genuine Turner painting from his life and time at Abbotsford.Her role was using her expert knowledge in the subject to help the owner unravel the story behind the painting of Scott\u0027s home. Combining that with the scientific study of the painting has enabled Ms Archer-Thompson to make the case.Ms Archer-Thompson is convinced it is a Turner because a pencil sketch, which can only be seen by infra-red imaging reveals the artist\u0027s original sketch. This has been adapated and changed siginficantly in the paint.The type of paper used for the watercolour also matches Turner\u0027s use of materials but the main focus was on the date of the frame and the paint.The scene of the Tuner painting is also found in the engraved commemorative book after Scott\u0027s death.Ms Archer-Thompson added: \u0027Not very long ago another lost Turner watercolour appeared and was sold for £230,000.\u0027The tiny watercolour, which is poket sized, measures at 5.5 inches by 3.5 inches.Libby Sheldon, a painting analyst expert, \u0027supports the theory\u0027 the Turner is a genuine.Ms Archer-Thompson, added: \u0027All of this analysis, including work by painting expert Libby Sheldon, demonstrates that it was executed by an astonishingly skilled hand.\u0027          The painting is believed to have been painted at the Scottish home of Sir Walter Scott, picturedWhen Turner stayed at Scott\u0027s house in August 1831, the writer showed the renowned painter his art collection, amongst which is believed to be a view of Abbotsford and the River Tweed by Scottish artist Elizabeth Nasmyth.Ms Archer-Thompson said: \u0027This painting is from exactly the same vantage point we believe Turner painted.\u0027Scott had a personal attachment to the Nasmyth painting and its composition and my theory is that this gave Turner the idea to compose the same scene, which he based on sketches in the Abbotsford sketchbook used during his visit in 1831.\u0027Abbotsford House Trust chairman James Holloway, a former director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, added: \u0027It is wonderful for Abbotsford to be able to show such a fascinating painting.\u0027It will intrigue and delight our visitors.

Then I saw the police jump out and run to the building.‘They split up: some went to the upper road and some took the lower road and some went by the lake. It was getting dark. We were sitting there thinking “Should we be afraid?” — because one of the policemen took his gun out.’Then, leaping from the first-floor balcony, the man attempted to flee, jumping down to the lawn below.Luckily, officers who had been staking out the flat for days were ready and waiting — wrestling him to the ground and securing him with handcuffs.He has been under lock and key ever since. And, if the authorities have their way, he will remain so for some considerable time.Because the smooth-talking ‘business executive’ is none other than Mark Acklom, Britain’s most wanted conman.He’s been on the run for more than four years, having allegedly fleeced orcee Carolyn Woods out of her £850,000 life savings while posing as a wealthy banker and MI6 agent, and is suspected of cheating dozens more by claiming to be a property developer, City broker, lawyer and even a gynaecologist.Cancer-stricken England fan, 63, will be held in Russia for...Tragic Alesha, six, was \u0027raped and murdered before her body...Share this articleHis arrest brings to an end a Europe-wide manhunt for the privately-educated swindler. Acklom, known for his love of fast cars, first-class travel and expensive hotels, is alleged to have used dozens of false identities to stay one step ahead of the authorities.At the weekend, his luck finally ran out after an international operation involving the National Crime Agency, Avon and Somerset Police and the Swiss authorities.Proceedings to extradite him to the UK are now underway and he is expected to face at least 20 charges of fraud and other offences.For his alleged victims, the news, while welcome, is bittersweet. Because it is almost impossible to overestimate the devastation they say Acklom has left in his wake.‘It has been a very long haul and my health has suffered,’ 61-year-old Miss Woods, who lives in Bath, told the Mail this week. ‘It seems every time I try to start afresh, something else happens with him and it brings the whole episode rushing back.’Meanwhile, IT specialist Christopher Frampton, 55, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, claims his health and marriage collapsed under the strain of being fleeced out of £50,000 when, he says, the conman persuaded him to give up his lucrative corporate job for a business venture that turned out to be a scam.‘It devastated my life so much, I’m having therapy,’ he says. ‘I am cross that Acklom was living in a million-pound property in Switzerland — I lost all the money I’d saved and my family went from living comfortably to living hand-to-mouth.’          Mark Acklom (pictured) with his wife Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez at Ascot\u0027s Royal EnclosureEven Acklom’s own family, from whom he has been estranged for years, still bear the scars from his behaviour.His mother, Diana, told us: ‘My marriage broke up over this, and his children by his first wife don’t have anything to do with him.‘If he wanted to really run away, he should have gone to South America, like Ronnie Biggs. But I think he liked to live on the edge — he needed to have a buzz.‘I was speaking to his brother and he said: “How can he live not knowing who would be behind the next knock on the door?’’’And, make no mistake, in recent months the net had been steadily tightening around him.The current manhunt was launched in October 2016 when a European arrest warrant was issued by Avon and Somerset Police, originally focusing on allegations of fraud linked to Ms Woods.She claims that in 2012, Acklom had walked into the boutique where she worked in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and swept her off her feet, saying he was Mark Conway, a Swiss banker.By the end of their year-long ‘romance’, Miss Woods says she had lent him every penny of her £850,000 life savings.The mother-of-two claims that she was financially ruined and on the brink of suicide when Acklom left her.When the warrant was sought, British police believed Acklom was hiding in Spain: he had a Spanish wife, Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez, whom he married in 2009 and with whom he had two children.But in May 2017, the hunt switched to Switzerland after he was photographed at a Geneva cafe by one of his alleged victims, who spotted him by chance.When police examined the images, they realised he was drinking coffee with a Spanish fraudster, also then on the run.The café was staked out — but Acklom never returned.Then, earlier this year, he was linked to a flat in a northern suburb of Zurich, from which it was believed he had been setting up various companies in a bid to attract investors.One business claimed to be manufacturing computer chips for black-box data recorders for cars. The company’s website suggested it had customers from the luxury car industry.Its motto is: ‘Being Defeated Is Optional.’At one point, undercover police mounted a surveillance operation on a bank following a tip-off that Acklom was planning to meet staff and business associates there, but he did not show up.At the time, Sky News revealed that Acklom still had a current passport and a Swiss residency permit in the name of Marc Long — one of several aliases he has used. The legitimate documents were obtained in 2014, shortly after Acklom fled Britain and after he had changed his name by deed poll.          As a teenager, his behaviour rapidly deteriorated from difficult to the downright dreadfulWhat we have now established is that for the past year he has been living in a stunning first-floor apartment overlooking Lake Zurich and has continued to have access to considerable sums of money.The apartment he was renting in the town of Wädenswil, 25 miles south of Zurich, would have cost him up to £2,500 a month. The children were being educated at a local private school.‘My first impression of him was that he was someone who didn’t really want to talk to people,’ said one neighbour. ‘I saw the wife and kids on the paddle board but they’d never say hello.’And Acklom himself was seemingly concerned about being recognised. He generally spoke Spanish, had grown shoulder-length hair and a bushy beard and would always wear sunglasses and a baseball cap. He looked very different, say neighbours, from his police ‘Wanted’ picture.His 47-year-old wife, meanwhile, had continued to indulge her life-long love of yoga.Since last August, she had been paying for one-to-one yoga classes, booking five sessions in advance each time. In the holidays, her ‘very sweet’ children accompanied her to the classes.She used the name Maria Longi and paid in cash — the only one of the instructor’s clients to do so.The instructor, who asked not to be named, said Maria claimed her husband managed a project concerning electronic ‘black boxes’ for cars and was ‘in the IT business’. Out of curiosity, she had searched the internet for more information, but found nothing.Although his wife is not believed to be wanted for any crime, sources close to the case have speculated whether the very existence of a wife and children — three extra people for the authorities to try to trace — may ultimately have hastened his downfall.Last autumn, police had specifically appealed for information about his wife and daughters. They said they believed the children would be attending private schools and that his wife was likely to indulge her passion for yoga.They were right on both counts.‘We have an incredibly high success rate in tracking down fugitives from British justice,’ said Ian Cruxton, head of international operations for the National Crime Agency, in the wake of the arrest.‘We do that through a host of techniques, including mobilising the ability of the public to assist us, which is why we publish the identities of these iniduals.’While celebrating the good news, those who know Acklom say they will not be happy until he is back in Britain to face justice.  Proceedings to extradite him  are now underway and he may face at least 20 charges of fraudRaised in Bromley, Kent, Mark Acklom was the eldest of four children born to a City insurance consultant. He was educated at the prestigious Dulwich Preparatory school. He then went on to board at Eastbourne College, an independent boarding and day school in East Sussex.Despite having all the advantages money could buy, from the beginning, he was a troublesome child. His mother, Diana, believes that a difficult birth may have left him with a brain injury that meant he struggled to empathise with others.‘When he was two, I bought our first puppy,’ she recalled. ‘I had just brought her home and she was sitting on the stairs. He went up and just kicked her out the way. That was the first time I thought this was odd. Most children would go up to a puppy and cuddle it.’In a bid to embrace his difference, when her son was seven, Diana placed a sign on his bedroom door reading: ‘Why be normal?’But as a teenager, his behaviour rapidly deteriorated from difficult to the downright dreadful.As an adult, Acklom made plans to become a Catholic priest then just as quickly dropped them.Next, he married a girl he met in a nightclub. His daughter and son were born shortly afterwards. But the relationship didn’t last, and Acklom walked out on his family when the children were young and never saw them again.Soon afterwards he headed to Spain, but later returned to Britain and became the director of a series of short-lived companies.In 2012, he allegedly met Miss Woods, as well as others, including Mr Frampton, and reportedly once even claimed to be a ‘close business associate’ of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone.While many who met him say they suffered, Acklom and his family continued to live the high-life. Following the events of last weekend, that, however, looks set to change.Two days after his arrest, his wife, who yesterday was still in the lakeside apartment with her children, turned up as usual for her yoga session, telling the instructor that it would have to be her last.‘I don’t have the money to pay for them any more,’ she said.Quite whether she had any idea of her husband’s alleged deceptions remains to be seen. For now at least, it seems, she will no longer be enjoying the fruits of his labours.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/21/4DFD00EB00000578-0-image-a-2_1530908499120.jpg","title":"Suspended Labour MP caught renting constituency office party colleague","story":"    Labour MP Jared O\u0027Mara, who has spent most of his parliamentary career without his party whip has been reinstated this week after receiving a warning about his conduct          O\u0027Mara, 37, has been renting a constituency office, pictured,  from a Labour Party councillorMr O’Mara, 37, was reinstated by the Labour Party last week after receiving a formal warning.Now it has emerged that his Sheffield office is owned by a company whose sole directors are Abdul Khayum, a Labour councillor in the city, and Mr Khayum’s brother, Dr Amir Afzal, a Sheffield GP.

The eager Khan was soon developing a speciality in minority-grievance cases.He became a partner in his firm by his mid-30s, dabbled in local politics and increasingly styled himself the representative of high-profile victims of what he might in those days have called ‘the establishment system’. From there, in those days of early Blairism, it was a comparatively easy step to become Labour MP for Tooting in 2005.At first he was impressive: his energy palpable as he caught the Speaker’s eye. His voice had an urgency. He worked his fringe into a little quiff with hair gel. He was a boxy-shouldered, bustling figure and earned some respect for the way he ignored the New Labour Whips and – apparently acting from the highest principles – opposed Tony Blair’s plans to lock up terror suspects for 90 days without charge. He also criticised Blair for the invasion of Iraq.But then ambition again infected his bones. After Gordon Brown replaced Blair as Prime Minister, the Whips sidled up to the man who had so recently rebelled against them.Did he fancy joining their crew? A job in the Government!

Most politicians are egomaniacs but this one takes it to new, almost comical extremes (there is a glorious photograph of him striking a butch pose and placing his hand on some railings which had a ‘WET PAINT’ sign on them).Most politicians break or bend their word but this one does it with bells on. Most politicians are opportunists but Sadiq Khan has made short-term posturing so much his speciality, he would win the gold medal for it at any Interstellar Olympics. Take his non-gender-specific traffic lights. When ‘trans rights’ were the big thing a couple of years ago, someone suggested – for all I know in jest – that it was a denial of trans people’s rights that pedestrian signals at road crossings only showed a little green or red man.And so the newly-elected Mayor Khan ordained that such lights, at public cost and to widespread mockery, should be altered so that the signals now show politically-correct diagrams rather than a little chap.Take his indignant demand for a national bank holiday for Prince Harry’s wedding (er, it was held on a Saturday). One day it was a headline, the next day, amid embarrassed coughing, it could be filed under ‘Y’ for ‘yesterday’s news’.Or his feckless declaration that new homes in central London should not be allocated parking spaces because residents should use public transport – the same public transport whose fees he has allowed to rise – and save the planet by reducing their carbon footprint.

Was he playing it both ways, tacking to the minority-ethnic vote while at the same time asserting his London-born credentials? Perish the thought!But that, alas, is the nature of this shallow, self-serving figure, a man many Labour MPs have still not forgiven for encouraging Ed Miliband to stand against his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, a disastrous misjudgement which led to the party being taken over by the extremists of Momentum.Mr Khan may not worry much about that. After all, he himself is safely ensconced as London mayor, having beaten a weak challenge from the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith in 2016. I’m all right Jack!Likewise, he will be thinking himself jolly clever this weekend as the country prepares for Mr Trump’s visit. He has got one over the most powerful man in the world!In London, it is claimed, Donald Trump is widely disliked. He is certainly opposed by the metropolitan elite, who have never forgiven him for beating their heroine Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.You wonder, however, what they think of Trump on those building sites and boxing gyms where the young Sadiq Khan spent his time.I suspect they have a rather higher opinion of the US President as someone who stands up for the working classes and who speaks their language.Trump is certainly a better communicator than arid, charmless Khan. The best political communicators speak from the heart. It is when politicians strike false poses, with words written for them by strategists and advisers, that they fail to convince.And the sorry fact is that since he became London mayor, Mr Khan has struggled to say anything interesting or radical.When the creators of the ‘Baby Trump’ balloon first told London’s City Hall about their stunt, they met with little reaction. But then, suddenly, the project was given the mayor’s blessing.Did Mr Khan’s Press handlers suddenly get wind of the wheeze and spot its potential for a few headlines that might move the public’s attention away from his dreadful record on crime prevention?Mr Khan’s decision to make a political thing of this balloon lark will no doubt win the acclaim of the Twittersphere. But the City of London’s banks and finance houses depend greatly on American custom and goodwill. Donald Trump is a notoriously touchy president. As a nation we need to persuade him to give post-Brexit Britain a trade deal.The balloon stunt will gain Mr Khan oodles of publicity. But what will it do for the reputation of a City, and our country, which needs to earn the goodwill of the White House?Would a serious mayor, a proper, substantial, internationally-minded leader of our capital city, in touch with his real constituents rather than fringe protesters, not have put such considerations above his own childish posturing?As for that Baby Trump inflatable, we must earnestly hope it is not peppered by someone with a long-distance rifle. Pop goes the weasel Khan’s silly stunt. One can but hope.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/00/4DF7DA2400000578-0-image-a-16_1530920636540.jpg","title":"Alan Titchmarsh says water companies stop blaming gardeners","story":"    Aerial images highlight the effect the heatwave is having on Britain\u0027s green and pleasant land as the parched earth turns an arid yellow amid scorching temperatures and little rainfall    With the heatwave set to last, suppliers are warning their customers to use less water or face a banBut Titchmarsh, 69, hit out at the warnings, saying that water firms waste so much in leaks themselves.Three billion litres of water simply drains away every day, according to regulator Ofwat. Titchmarsh told Horticulture Week magazine: ‘A hosepipe ban would be galling when so much water is not properly managed and leaks.

Shockingly, cousin marriages are a key factor in an average of two child deaths every week.This figure is derived from the fact that a total of 545 boys or girls born to closely related couples have died in childhood during the past five years, according to the Department for Education, which collates data from Child Death Overview Panels in every council area. (It is the job of these panels to examine the deaths of any child under the age of 18.)Thousands more children of consanguineous marriages survive, but with appalling physical or mental problems. These include blindness, deafness, blood ailments, heart or kidney failure, lung or liver problems and a myriad of often incurable and complex neurological or brain disorders.According to a report for the BBC’s Newsnight, British Pakistanis are 13 times more likely to have children with genetic disorders than the general population.They are responsible for three percent of all births, but produce just under a third of all British children with such health problems.In Birmingham, around one in ten children from first cousin marriages either dies in infancy or develops a serious life-long disability caused by genetic ailments, according to health officials in the city, where half the mothers of Pakistani origin are married to a close relative.Meanwhile, a research document by the NHS-funded Enhanced Genetic Services Project reveals that in Birmingham in 2009-2010, the combined infant stillbirth and death rate ‘definitely or probably’ due to genetic disorders inherited from Pakistani cousin parents was 38 times higher than that among white European babies in the city.The report — one of the most thorough into this health and social problem — says: ‘Almost a third of the affected children die before five years of age.Most of the survivors suffer chronic disability, and they are cared for by their families, posing tremendous emotional and financial strain.’Up in Bradford, where teenager Hiba Maroof lives, doctors and nurses have told me paediatric wards look after numerous children who are unable to speak, and are fed through tubes.

But Guy Stagg began his on 1 January. And the destination wasn’t Canterbury but Jerusalem, along the Via Francigena, 3,420 miles away, which, among other things, meant crossing the Alps in the middle of winter – alone, on foot, and with little more equipment than a borrowed pair of snow shoes. After which, most of the journey, and all its many challenges, still lay ahead. Crazy or what? Even the spiritual-minded might think his quest unwise.But faith isn’t what drove him. He stopped believing in God as a teenager. Despite the odd preparatory hike, he wasn’t much of a walker, either (“My legs are short, my stride hurried – an anxious wasteful gait”). Behind his decision to “wander out of my life” for the next 10 months was the nervous breakdown he’d had before. “I\u0026nbspthought the journey might build me up again,” he says. “I walked to mend myself.” Solvitur ambulando. His issues would be solved by walking.The idea is an old one, with many medieval precedents. But the model for Stagg was more recent: Benoît-Joseph Labre, “patron not only of pilgrims, but also of vagrants, unmarried men and the mentally ill”, who wandered through western Europe for\u0026nbspseven years in the 1770s, covering more than 30,000\u0026nbspkm. Still, even he didn’t make it to Jerusalem. Could Stagg?The early signs aren’t good. In a single day, he splits his boots while wading waist-deep in snow, falls off a wooden footbridge into a stream, and has to sprint for his life along railway tracks when a train emerges from a tunnel. And then there’s the\u0026nbspGreat Saint Bernard Pass, which he’s warned is far too dangerous to tackle in February but does so anyway, in a blizzard. Other hazards and setbacks quickly follow. Whenever he wavers, he remembers his depression and thoughts of suicide the year before. Only by pushing on can he get free of the past.No one else he meets is walking as far as Jerusalem and, though he occasionally falls in step with a fellow hiker, he prefers to go it alone. Solitude allows for greater attentiveness to landscape and he dutifully searches for metaphors to honour its variety: “the mountains were shining plates of armour”, “frozen puddles scattered the dawn like smashed gemstones”, “sunlight spread” on a lake’s surface “like sequins sewn into the water”, “stars filled the night like metal filings”. Alone by day, at night he looks to strangers to take him in – monks, priests and nuns mostly. And they do, without exception, offering shelter and serving up meals one woman, a volunteer cook in a convent, even washes and kisses his feet. He’s also taught history lessons – about saints, martyrs, heretics, hermits and flagellants. Monastic life is a form of imprisonment, he says with a pilgrimage you’re on\u0026nbspthe move. But the two have much in common, he decides: pain, privation, penitence, sacrifice, surrender of the self, “substitute suicide”.Faithless though he is, “a non-believer hoping a ritual would heal him”, Stagg is fascinated by the history of Christianity associated with his route (the Crusaders, Knights Templar, Bogomils, etc) and times his arrival in Rome for Holy Week, to see the new pope sworn in. But Rome brings his first serious crisis: repelled by the crowds and “the mindlessness of collective devotion”, he suffers a panic attack and flees. Walking through Albania, he recovers his spirits\u0026nbspthere’s even a brief promise of romance. But in Thessaloniki he hits rock bottom, or rather the booze: alcoholism is another part of the past that he’s trying to escape, but for a few days, in despair, he lets go and binges on ouzo. Though he soon recovers, doubts assail him: is completing the journey worth the effort? What if it causes another breakdown? When he decides he’ll fly home from Istanbul, what he feels isn’t defeat but “a surging sense of freedom”.And maybe Istanbul would have been his end-point, had he not been caught up in the violence there: protests in Gezi Park, tear gas, rubber bullets. Whereas the crowds in Rome made him run away, here he stays and regains a sense of purpose. It’s the same in Tripoli, Lebanon, when two bombs go off: for all the terror he feels, the vast bravura sentence describing what happened is strangely exhilarating. There are more trials to come, including sickness bouts, scary border guards and encounters with zealots and oddballs (including the dentist famous for resuscitating a sick alligator through a straw). He also wearies of pilgrim shrines and Jesus-freakery at one point he watches 111 Indonesian men being baptized in the River Jordan while 111 wives applaud from the shore. Still, he’s determined to reach his goal, and 10 months after setting out he finally does –\u0026nbspthough without quite the ending he expects.There have been some excellent footslog memoirs in recent years, including Nick Hunt’s Walking the Woods and the Water, and Where the Wild Winds Are, but none describing as marathon a trek as Stagg’s. He’s engagingly honest about the boredom he feels in transit and on overnight stops (at one point, he invents a game of scoring monks’ beards for marks out of 10 according to length and thickness). And despite his use of Christ-like imagery in the final pages, where he talks of being “thankful for these wounds” and of stepping out “into the risen light”, there’s no triumphant resolution. If there’s a message, it’s not about recovery or transformation, but about the charity shown to him along the way. His stamina is only half the story without the kindness of others, he’d never have made it.• The Crossway is published by Picador.

A mountain of outrage builds up, and countless misdemeanours are submerged in the process. So here’s a relic from last August: questioned on the clashes between “alt-right” neo-Nazis and anti-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump remarked that there were some “very fine people on both sides”. The equivalence was sickening, though wasn’t helped by media references to the protesters as the “alt-left”.Trump pushed the logic of “both sides” much further than most politicians or pundits would be willing to do. But the political upheavals of the past few years have driven liberal observers to pose some related questions. Are the polarities of left and\u0026nbspright really so different from each other? Does Corbynism not share something with Trumpism?Part of this can be characterised as “horseshoe theory”, the idea that the political spectrum is shaped like a horseshoe, with right and left starting to converge on each other as they become more radical. But\u0026nbspother things are muddying the waters as well. A\u0026nbspnew\u0026nbspstrand of economic nationalism has emerged, advanced by the likes of Steve Bannon in the US, Marine Le Pen in France and the Five Star Movement in Italy, that channels resentment towards immigration and international capital simultaneously. In Europe, this is producing new xenophobic defences of the welfare state, as sometimes deployed by Ukip. National independence movements can be equally difficult to place on the political spectrum.But there is another reason why “left” and “right” appear similar right now: populism. We live in what the\u0026nbspBelgian political theorist Chantal Mouffe characterises\u0026nbspas a “populist moment”, in which politics has become\u0026nbspimpassioned, confrontational, angry and unpredictable, dispensing with all the rules and expectations that have governed liberal democracies since the 1970s. If the distinction between left and right has become foggier, this is partly because a similar set of forces are being unleashed on both sides, including devotion to leaders, suspicion of the media, street-level mobilisation and an emotional sense of injustice.The distinction between “people” and adversary is the fundamental starting point of all politics, Mouffe argues, adapting the ideas of political theorist and Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt. Technocrats are oblivious to\u0026nbspthis, and the conflictual (or in Mouffe’s term agonistic) nature of politics gets concealed for long periods of hegemony, during which politics becomes “a\u0026nbspmere issue of managing the established order, a\u0026nbspdomain reserved for experts”. Margaret Thatcher succeeded in building just such a hegemony, painting her policies as the only way of acting in the nation’s interests, such that a common-sense view of the economy was already in place by the time New Labour came to\u0026nbsppower.The 2008 financial crisis signalled the end of that Thatcherite hegemony, and\u0026nbspthe start of our present populist moment. At such times, we enter a period of radical indeterminacy, in which everything is up for grabs until some kind of new “people” is assembled and a new hegemony established. Oddly for a political theorist, Mouffe recognises that theory is of little use in such situations, given that so much is shaped by the contingencies of each situation. Everything comes down to strategies, tactics and the ability to seize the initiative before the adversary. The battle to achieve a new common sense encompasses party politics, civil society and the media, influencing how ordinary people feel as well as think. Thatcher had the Rupert Murdoch press on her side. Today, one might point to the battles taking place on social media.The question remains, how exactly do we distinguish right from left in this bewildering new landscape? Or perhaps we no longer need to. Now that the man who saw “very fine people on both sides” in Charlottesville is building concentration camps, and Italy’s deputy prime minister, Mario Salvini, has called for a “mass cleansing” of migrants, merely opposing fascism might be grounds enough for\u0026nbspa popular mobilisation. What distinguishes left populism, says Mouffe, is that “the people” is constructed democratically rather than on the basis of nation or race. With good strategic leadership, a radically democratic and egalitarian movement can be a match for nativism.There is certainly piecemeal evidence that this is true. What made Syriza thrilling in its early days was the resistance it offered to the far-right Golden Dawn as much as to the Troika. Corbyn’s Labour has avoided the electoral collapse that has afflicted virtually every other established centre-left party in\u0026nbspEurope. Maybe Bernie Sanders would have held those crucial mid-Western states that Hilary Clinton could not in 2016. But Mouffe offers no guidance as to\u0026nbsphow left populism can fight and succeed, nor any reassurance that it will. No doubt that’s in keeping with her view of democracy: nothing in politics is real, until it has been constructed through struggle.Yet there is something disconcerting here that she doesn’t address. If politics is about the naming of enemies, doesn’t the right start with a huge advantage over the left? Or when the left starts to play this game, isn’t there a risk that certain aspects of fascism (such as antisemitism) start to creep into its programme? When Mouffe strives to articulate what distinguishes left populism, it sometimes tips into the banalities of any moderate politician of the past thirty years. “The objective of a left populist strategy is the creation of a\u0026nbsppopular majority to come to power and establish a progressive hegemony” could almost have been written by Tony Blair. Nor is she prepared to rule out\u0026nbspthe appeal to “nation” as a tool for collective mobilisation. To be fair, she is arguing partly with the\u0026nbsphard left who (unlike her) want nothing to do with parliamentary politics, and believes underlying historical forces will eventually see them triumph. However, “Yes, but how?” is the recurring question this short book provokes, not out of scepticism but from an urgent need for answers.The US journalist John Judis writes in The Populist Explosion that leftwing populism is “diadic”, whereas rightwing populism is “triadic”. The former opposes “the people” to an “elite”, whereas the latter always adds a third party, typically immigrants, whom the “elite” are accused of favouring. This is far more categorical than Mouffe is willing to be, given her insistence that politics is riven with uncertainty, emotion and conflict, but it does clarify what exactly is at stake. If the political task right now is to construct a “people” from which a new common sense can be built, the question of how that can be done so as to include strangers and newcomers may be the most important one of the next few years.• William Davies’s Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World will be published by Cape in September.

But her satirical take on a black woman in search of her whiteness now makes perfect senseBefore you set out on any voyage, you better damn well know if you’re running from, or going to. The outlook makes all the difference, and the risk for disappointment, disillusionment or even danger doubles if you’re not sure, or didn’t really think about it. It takes only one verb and a preposition to change the course of a life and when you are a woman like Christine, the designated “Oreo” of Fran Ross’s 1974 novel, then your entire life’s journey, in your mind and on the road, becomes an act of figuring that voyage out. At the core of such a journey must be a mystery, left by her cryptic father about her birth, that she is compelled to solve. Answers never come to you unless you seek them out, which usually means somebody goes on a trip. And why not, since journeys are about discoveries, and if all you encountered is what you already knew, then you might have travelled, but you didn’t really leave.The quest – that most male of missions – is to find herself, that most metaphysical of missions. But Christine is a black woman on a mission to find her whiteness, a bold contrast to the far more celebrated race book of the time, Alex Haley’s Roots. Maybe a black woman finding herself in whiteness was one of those things that people would have said ain’t nobody got time for. But Oreo is in its own time. More than that, there are so many of us like Christine, mixed-race kids who search for whiteness not because they want to be white, but more often than not because that is the side of the family cut off from them. The absent daddy is white, inverting the common and stubbornly persistent myth of the absent black father, while reinforcing the truth that the white parent of the non-white kid was more often missing in action too. And even if he was present, the rest of his kin were so absent that family still became a mystery.This is why Christine has to go. To leave. To search. To embark on a voyage full of the thrilling, the saddening, the fantastical and the ridiculous, but the kind of voyage where there is never any return. Perhaps this is why Ross had, and has, so few peers. Few writers wanted to go where she wanted to go, and just about none wanted to get there her way. Add to that the rise of the black power and the black arts movements, and her novel – where identity was never a declared absolute – would be one that not many in these movements would have wanted to read (good luck getting past the connotations of the title). It raises the spectre that haunts any person who code-shifts: that in trying to negotiate between two identities, you end up never fully being one or the other, and rejected by both. But the book pulls it off because of its relentless postmodernness, and the fun Ross clearly had writing it. That’s pretty rare too, the work of fiction that reflects the enjoyment the writer had in creating it.This all sounds like a horrendous bore. And yet at all times Oreo buzzes with whip-smart comic ferocity. The book is just goddamn funny. Its most wildly discursive turns are still delivered with a smartass wink, just one degree short of too clever for its own good, meaning just clever. Oreo laughs in the face of the American one-drop ideal of whiteness that produces Oreos in the first place. It revels in yet mocks its own hybridity, and that of the characters. It pulls off the unique trick of slapping white supremacy in the face, while never letting go of the ideal of (and the desire for) whiteness itself.But what do we do with a novel like Oreo? Back in 1974, the answer was nothing. It vanished before the year was even out, and Fran Ross never wrote another one. When her only novel reappeared in 2015, it was still too far ahead of its time. Yes, Frances Delores Ross was finally taking her rightful place among the great black satirists, and the great 70s fabulists. Yet if satire and mythmaking were all Oreo had going for it, readers wouldn’t have felt as if a great missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle finally snapped into place. That for all its bells and whistles – and the novel is crowded with both – readers could see themselves in it. The belated, though thunderous acclaim was both well deserved and bittersweet. You can’t escape wondering, when you’ve finished this novel, what the landscape of literature would have looked like had she been given her due. Instead, the few magazines that bothered to review her, such as Esquire, were left bewildered by the same kind of sentences that entranced them when they came from Thomas Pynchon, or Joseph Heller.Maybe, had more people read Oreo, it would have blown wide open all that we have come to expect from so-called metafiction. Primarily because metafiction has always been looked on as a white man’s game and still is, despite the continuing output of novelists such as Chris Abani, Jeanette Winterson and Percival Everett. And if not just a white man’s game, it was certainly a playground for only men. John Gardner, in The Art of Fiction, spends some serious time reckoning with the metafictioners, and boils down the very essence of this kind of fiction to one phrase – jazzing around. Jazzing around takes a special genius, in which the ability to plan plays hardly any part. It requires inexhaustible imagination … and the taste to know when the magic isn’t quite good enough. The two gifts, one extraordinarily childlike, the other highly sophisticated and mature, almost never show up in one person.But they did show up in one person. For Oreo is nothing if not jazzing around, and not just because of its incredible rhythm, or constantly surprising turns that recall improvisation, or because it is indeed extraordinarily childlike but highly sophisticated. The novel’s constant dialectical tension recalls jazz itself. Free jazz, intentionally playing with poetry and cacophony, music and noise, meaning and nonsense, black and Jewish. It’s a novel that reads as the smartest and wildest conversation you’ve ever had, with the friend that’s too smart for her own good. Would Gardner have recognized that Ross wrote exactly what he was talking about? The easy answer is no, because even if he and writers like him could let go of the idea that such narrative bravado had to be tied to a penis, the fact of such prose coming from a black woman was another matter entirely. A homegirl, a soul sister out-Barthing Barth, or Barthelme for that matter. Maybe he would have said it was too scattered, and as a novelist (if not as a woman) Ross needed to settle. Yet that unsettledness is where the novel gets its timeless power. You cannot date Oreo because Oreo flouts date. You cannot read it for a resolution, because one is never coming—certainly not in the way we expect even the wildest story to resolve itself.You could slot Oreo into the incredible, and incredibly long, list of neglected black classics, which includes The Chaneysville Incident by David Bradley, Thereafter Johnnie by Carolivia Herron and the Messenger magazine, but finding it is more like stumbling on Shuggie Otis for the first time and realising that you’ve missed a crucial building block of funk.Or maybe Ross is closer in spirit to the writers in the 70s who managed to make this patchwork sell. Of course they were all white men: Vonnegut, Barth, Pynchon, and so on. People playing with style and form, as if the very play on surface was deep enough. In that way Oreo is only skin deep. But deliberately so, because mixed-skin issues are vast enough to cause ambiguity and tension, but also because Ross is more interested in spreading wide.Many of us are not Oreos. Not as defined by the constant inbetweenness Ross was talking about, or in the forsaking of blackness for the ass-kissing of whiteness that it means now. But many of us people of colour, regardless of race makeup, find that our lives are indeed always in flux. That colour is a fixed thing for only one race. That the messed- up-ness of the novel, at times wise, silly, sad and funny, reflects the messed-up-ness of our lives, and sometimes it takes a work verging on allegory to give us true realness. Of course, back in 1974 heads weren’t ready. Many of us aren’t ready today. But Oreo’s time is most certainly now. Because, more than ever, with the real world skidding off into madness, absurdity and chaos, this crazy, sexy, cool novel now makes perfect sense •• Oreo by Fran Ross is published by Picador.

It felt true to life.Cuz: The Life and Times of Michael A (Bodley Head) by Danielle Allen, a memoir about the loss of a beloved cousin, is unbearably moving. It illuminates the injustice often meted out to young black men by the American criminal justice system.Uzodinma Iweala’s Speak No Evil (John Murray), in which a young Nigerian American comes out as gay, is a coming of age story about the difficult, churning mix of family expectations. It is elegant and elegiac, and evokes Washington DC with subtle power.The Years by Annie Ernaux (Fitzcarraldo) is a remarkable work, a truly innovative autobiography that opens new ways of remembering and recuperating the past. The Long Take, by Robin Robertson (Picador), is a narrative in verse set in the immediate post-war years in America, that is at once heartbreaking and bracing. Think of it as the best black and white 1940s movie you will ever encounter in print.The Order of Time, by Carlo Rovelli (Allen Lane), hardly seems like pool-side reading, but anyone with the least interest in the science of the physical world will be by turns astonished, baffled and thrilled by what Rovelli has to say about the true nature of time, which has little in common with our everyday conception of it. Rovelli is the poet of quantum physics.Seamus Heaney 100 Poems (Faber) is an essential collection, which the poet meant to make before he died, and which the Heaney family have now completed. A feast of beauty.I’ve greatly enjoyed two group biographies: Agnès Poirier’s rich and funny Left Bank (Bloomsbury), about cold rooms and hot ideas in postwar Paris and Martin Gayford’s wise and generous Modernists and Mavericks (Thames \u0026amp Hudson), about artists in London from 1945 to 1970. And what to read in homage to Philip Roth? Maybe American Pastoral.Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine (Granta), a very lively book about transhumanism, won the Wellcome prize. Sally Rooney is 27 and so won’t be worrying about mortality – she entered the landscape fully fledged in the now traditional Irish manner, and with great power, – like Katherine Mansfield and Elizabeth Bowen fused together – with Conversations with Friends (Faber). Just in case it gets lost in the newer dazzle, it’s worth mentioning again Red Dirt (Head of Zeus, 2015) by EM Reapy, which won the Rooney prize, an Irish stormer set in Australia.I’m lucky enough to be reading Only to Sleep by Lawrence Osborne (out from Hogarth in September). A brilliant Raymond Chandler continuation novel with an ageing Philip Marlowe. Osborne and Chandler are a perfect match. Luke Kennard’s wit and astonishing virtuosity, so present in his poetry, have safely made the journey to his beguiling first novel The Transition (4th Estate): very funny, gimlet-eyed observation. Talking of poetry, Michael O’Neill’s latest collection Return of the Gift (Arc) is wise, lucid and pitch perfect.I just read Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire (Bloomsbury). It’s brilliant in itself, but it also made me rethink Sophocles’s Antigone, on which it is loosely based. For some high-fibre holiday reading, I shall be packing Josephine Quinn’s In Search of the Phoenicians (Princeton), which dares to ask whether that famous ancient people really existed, and promises to expose the modern fantasies and ideologies that created them.Broad Band (Portfolio) is a brilliantly written and necessary history of our foremost cultural technology by Claire Evans. It illuminates the occluded contributions of many women to the medium over more than 150 years, and transforms our understanding in doing so. From mathematicians to community managers, engineers to speleologists, Evans shows how the internet’s past, present and future are all utterly contingent upon its radical ersity.Daniel Trilling has spent years tracing the routes taken by migrants from across Africa and the Middle East to Europe, meeting people and keeping in touch with them along the way: in camps, in cafes, and on Facebook. In Lights in the Distance (Picador) he tells their stories – or, more often, allows them to tell their own – calmly, clearly and deeply affectingly, never losing sight of the violence, brutality and pervasive racism that underlies and maintains the present situation.Let Me Be Like Water by SK Perry (Melville House) is a wonderful debut novel about how we find our feet again after a bereavement. It’s one of the best evocations of the grieving process I’ve read and is written in a fluid engaging style that draws you in to the protagonist Holly’s world.There is not a word wasted in Fondue, the second collection of poems by AK Blakemore (Offord Road). I was struck by Blakemore’s gift for crafting memorable and devastating images that stay in the mind long after you’ve closed the book.I saw Michael Donkor read at Brixton library recently and was enthralled by the extract he shared from his debut novel Hold (4th Estate), which moves between London and Ghana. I am looking forward to reading it in full.Far and away the funniest (and saddest) new book I’ve read this year is The Collected Letters of Flann O’Brien (Dalkey Archive), although I’m slightly reluctant to suggest that anybody packs this 600-page doorstop in their beach bag. Otherwise, having just finished writing a novel myself, I’m eager to e back into other people’s fictional worlds, and am looking forward, equally, to Whistle in the Dark (Viking) by Emma Healey – which I’m told is even better than the excellent Elizabeth Is Missing – Old Baggage (Doubleday) by Lissa Evans (a novel of the suffragette movement that promises to be both warm and funny) and, for a bit of cold-eyed post-Brexit satire, Perfidious Albion (Faber) by Sam Byers.I am really enjoying Catherine Lacey’s short stories Certain American States (Granta) so will read her first novel Nobody Is Ever Missing to catch up. She is playful and smart, one of a generation of American women who seem entirely unafraid. Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room (Jonathan Cape) shows what happens when a smart writer gets truly serious. It is a necessary and compelling book, and this year’s must read. I will also bring proofs of Robert Alter’s translation of the Bible (out from Norton in December), the first single author translation ever to be published, and Human Relations and Other Difficulties (Profile), a collection of essays by Mary-Kay Wilmers, whose intelligence I find endlessly opaque and interesting.This is a brilliant summer for books by women: novels, memoirs and poems that address the difficult questions in women’s lives from an intimate perspective, but also with an unsentimental, distancing acuity and a preparedness to invent new forms for writing and for living. Three that seem to speak to each other in this respect are Deborah Levy’s game-changing The Cost of Living (Hamish Hamilton), Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber) and Sheila Heti’s Motherhood (Harvill Secker). I also love Kathyrn Maris’s new poetry collection The House With Only an Attic and a Basement (Penguin), which tackles motherhood and family life with a comic thoughtfulness that’s unusually open to cruelty and that can rise and fall easily between the heroic and the bathetic. And right now, the book that’s really gripping me, and making me start again in thinking about many things, is Silver Press’s reprint of Nell Dunn’s 1965 Talking to Women, a series of artfully transcribed conversations with 10 of her friends. What’s striking, reading this, is how much has changed but also how little. And, unusually, the lack of change doesn’t feel depressing, reading these interviews, because there’s a pleasure in feeling so connected to these women across the decades. Also, there’s a kind of satisfaction in feeling that it’s just as important to keep asking the questions she asked about how we live, and why, and it makes me grateful that we have Cusk and Heti and Levy and Maris still asking them.In Calypso (Little, Brown), David Sedaris’s essays marry meditations on family, suicide, grief and mortality with the hazards of bodily functions and frequent travel for his massively popular public readings. Sedaris is as much standup comic as writer, making this a great audio and one for the car journey. I’m currently reading The Female Persuasion by Meg Wolitzer, highly relevant in this fourth wave feminism moment and quietly gripping. I shall also be packing What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky (Tinder) by Lesley Nneka Arimah, whose New Yorker short stories I have enjoyed. Tsitsi Dangaremba’s This Mournable Body (Graywolf) isn’t out until August, but I shall read it before summer’s end.Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Antifragile (Penguin) really made me think about how I think. I am also rereading Homer’s Iliad (the Robert Fitzgerald translation) and making my way through Susan Wise Bauer’s History of the Ancient World (Norton).The Road to Unfreedom (Bodley Head) by Timothy Snyder is a brilliant and disturbing analysis of the rise of authoritarianism in Russia, Europe and the US in the second decade of the 21st century. Essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the political crisis currently engulfing the world.In Enlightenment Now (Allen Lane), Steven Pinker extols the amazing achievements of modernity, and demonstrates that humankind has never been so peaceful, healthy and prosperous. There is of course much to argue about, but that’s what makes this book so interesting.Yuval Noah Harari’s new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, will be published on 30 August by Jonathan Cape.I’m sure Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room is going to be great – at least if The Flamethrowers is anything to go by. In Ma’am Darling, 99 Excerpts from the Life of Princess Margaret (4th Estate), Craig Brown achieves the impossible by finding a tone in which to write about monarchy. Not bitchy, not snide, not angry, but not fawning nor deferential either. Just funny.I am rollicking through Pretend I’m Dead by Jen Beagin, which is one of the funniest, most twisted and freshest things I’ve read in a long time. It follows the fortunes of Mona, who cleans houses and falls for a man she calls Mr Disgusting. Beagin combines deep compassion and irreverent humour to create characters with nasty, wonderful, human flaws. Helen Barrell’s Fatal Evidence, Professor Alfred Swaine Taylor and the Dawn of Forensic Science is an engrossing read. It follows the career of Taylor, a remarkable scientist who gave evidence at the trial of William Palmer, “The Rugeley Poisoner”, pioneered the study of forensic medicine and let Charles Dickens nose around his laboratory. Barrell explores Taylor’s (occassionally bizarre) cases, his public and private persona and his wide-ranging interests, which included geology and photography. Her description of the ways in which forensic experiments evolved is as fascinating as the courtroom dramas they accompanied.Your Silence Will Not Protect You (Silver) collects Audre Lorde’s essays and poems together for the first time in the UK. I look forward to getting stuck in to Talking to Women, Nell Dunn’s 1964 conversation about sex, money, work and art with a group of friends – including the writer Ann Quin and pop artist Pauline Boty.My love affair with the explosive, erotic, modernist poetry of Apollinaire is the one enduring passion in my life. Many of his best poems were written when he was a soldier fighting on the front lines in WW1. It was Apollinaire who invented the word, Surrealist. In Zone: Selected Poems of Guillaume Apollinaire (NYRB), Ron Padgett’s translation from the French (Padgett wrote the poems for the bus driver poet in Jim Jarmusch’s film, Paterson) is pitch perfect and dazzling.I will also reread four books I initially read very fast, mostly because the skill of the writing itself is the main event in all of them: The Years by Annie Ernaux, Kudos by Rachel Cusk, The Little Virtues by Natalia Ginzburg (Daunt) and Three Poems by Hannah Sullivan (Faber).If you have not already met The Secret Barrister (Macmillan), he or she makes an entertaining and acerbic holiday companion for those who don’t switch off their brains in summer it seems our resource-starved legal system is poised on the brink of not working at all. Tessa Hadley’s short stories, Bad Dreams (Cape), are simple and artful and leave you wanting more. Didier Eribon’s memoir Returning to Reims (Allen Lane) is a haunting book, fiercely political and deeply personal I shall be thinking about it this summer and for many seasons to come.Chantal Mouffe’s For a Left Populism (Verso) is influencing left parties as they enter government, from Greece to Portugal to Mexico. It is a beach-sized introduction to a major left thinker of the 21st century. Mike Davis’s Old Gods, New Enigmas (Verso) is a challenging re-exploration of Marx in the light of the atomisation of class struggle, the climate crisis and the centrality of cities to social justice struggles. Patrick Langley’s debut novel Arkady comes beautifully presented by Fitzcarraldo. What’s not to like about a book where revolutionaries take over a city in the north of England?People always say not to judge a book by its cover, but people are wrong. Ashleigh Young’s collection of smart, funny, insightful and unexpected essays, Can You Tolerate This? (Bloomsbury), has a bright yellow cover, making it perfect summer reading. I love it. I’ve been telling people about Lucy Wood’s short stories ever since her debut collection came out a few years ago she’s back with another collection, The Sing of the Shore (4th Estate), and she’s better than ever. Finally, Melissa Harrison’s forthcoming All Among the Barley (Bloomsbury) is an astonishingly good evocation of rural England in the 1930s, complete with creeping fascism and the subjugation of women. It’s subtle and mesmerising and brilliantly detailed, and I’m going to lie down in a meadow and read it all over again.Fiction in English from Pakistan has redeemed its promise with dazzling consistency. Mohammed Hanif’s Red Birds (Bloomsbury) is a fresh marvel, describing with cool wit and steely yet tender intelligence the interlinked fates of antagonists in a forgotten war-scape – and the complicity of our own sheltered lives in remote conflicts. Anna Tsing’s The Mushroom at the End of the World (Princeton) is a poetic and remarkably fertile exploration of the relationship between human beings and the natural environment, and what can still be done to stem its rapid deterioration.The term neoliberalism provokes much choleric denial. But Quinn Slobodian’s Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism (Harvard) decisively establishes it as a coherent project, tracing it back to the political and intellectual synergies of the 1920s. Michelle Dean’s Sharp (Fleet), a portrait of 10 female writers and thinkers, is a bracing tribute to the life of the iconoclastic mind: a reminder, in our age of flashy hot takes, of the matchless power of sustained and elegant argument.Kept from the world by a crazed fundamentalist father, cowed herbalist mother and violent misogynist brother, it’s a miracle Tara Westover escaped her childhood in rural Idaho. Her memoir Educated (Hutchinson) brilliantly recounts her journey towards knowledge and enlightenment bravely, too – her family are still alive. With Rachel Cusk as with Karl Ove Knausgaard, you wonder what makes you keep turning the pages. But while he’s confessional, her narrator Faye lets other characters do the talking, giving little of herself away Kudos completes a remarkable trilogy. The crepuscular, dreamlike, post-1945 London that Michael Ondaatje invents in his novel Warlight (Cape) continues to haunt you long after the plot itself.Three Poems by Hannah Sullivan is the best first collection I’ve read for a long time: moving, technically adroit, clever in all the right ways, and full of brilliant small-scale effects as well as large achievements. Angela Leighton’s Hearing Things (Harvard) is as good as her previous book on poetic form – which is to say it’s terrific – and illuminates a great deal about the sound effects of poetry that cannot be disentangled from its page-sense. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos brings her enthralling trilogy to a well-judged conclusion, at once rounded and open.Now that Terry Pratchett is gone, Stephen King is one of the only authors I buy in hardback on publication day. His latest, The Outsider (Hodder), is both a detective and a horror novel, and it gripped me to the point of checking under the bed before I went to sleep. It reminded me of what it was like to lie reading by torchlight late at night, when camping in the summer.I’ve never been much of a reader of contemporary poetry, but I have been seduced by some of the brilliant young poets writing now, of whom Amy Key is perhaps my favourite. Her new collection, Isn’t Forever (Bloodaxe), is playful, surreal and enchanting but also rooted in brutal emotional honesty. She is writer of a rare and strange magic.I am lucky enough to have an advance proof of Mrs Gaskell and Me, the new book from the brilliantly gifted Nell Stevens: she describes it as a love letter to “her own very special, dear friend”, Mrs Gaskell, and I have it patiently waiting on my desk.On my bedside at the moment: Go, Went, Gone (Granta), a novel about the refugee crisis in Germany by Jenny Erpenbeck that is not only timely but masterful Matt Walker’s illuminating review of the science of sleep and how we’re all doing it wrong: Why We Sleep (Allen Lane) The Overstory (Heinemann), Richard Powers’ weird and wonderful novel about the intricate relationships among trees and humans and Carlo Rovelli’s mindbending The Order of Time.Liz Nugent’s Skin Deep (Penguin) is the perfect holiday read for those who like their escapism on the darker side. If Patricia Highsmith were Irish she might well have come up with this tale of a scarred woman who taints all she touches while remaining as charismatic as she is enigmatic.In The Smiling Man (Doubleday) Joseph Knox pulls off the “difficult second novel” with ease and considerable style. Labyrinthine Mancunian noir with the obligatory battered but dogged detective.Ambrose Parry, The Way of All Flesh isn’t published until late-August, but it’s a rip-roaring tale of murder amid the medical experiments of 19th-century Edinburgh. The book brings both city and period to colourful life and is a joy to read. It’s a collaboration between seasoned novelist Chris Brookmyre and his wife, consultant anaesthetist Marisa Haetzman.Irish lawyer Steve Cavanagh writes excellent courtroom thrillers set in the US. His latest, Thirteen (Orion), sees him at the top of his game. It features a serial killer who’s sitting on a jury. Terrific premise, and the resulting story doesn’t disappoint.I recently read Vivek Shanbhag’s Ghachar Ghochar (Faber), a perfectly formed short novel about a family in India undergoing a rapid change in fortune. Published in translation last year, it’s an admirably slim book – you could read it in one sitting – and for me it conjured up a whole world.I’d also recommend Sayaka Murata’s Convenience Store Woman (Portobello), an exhilaratingly weird and funny Japanese novel about a long-term convenience store employee. Unsettling and totally unpredictable – my copy is now heavily underlined.Finally, I don’t think I’ll ever forget the day I spent reading Olivia Laing’s Crudo (Picador). I couldn’t put it down, and then it overwhelmed me so much I had to put it down, and then I had to pick it back up again. A beautiful, strange, intelligent novel. My favourite book for adults this year, by some margin, has been Fifteen Dogs (Serpent’s Tail) by André Alexis. It opens with two gods having a quiet drink at The Wheat Sheaf in Toronto and debating whether, if animals had human intelligence, they would be only as unhappy, or more unhappy, than humans. It’s unhinged, wise, sharp, witty and daring. I’ve also fallen in love with Rachel Cusk’s Outline trilogy her work is staggering.In the world of children’s books, I can’t wait to read Hilary McKay’s The Skylarks’ War (Macmillan), set in the approaching shadow of the first world war. McKay couples warmth and grace with wry humour like nobody else out there.My recent (re-)reading includes Cervantes’ Don Quixote, Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita and Speak, Memory, Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, and Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, all books that don’t need me to recommend them. I have, however, immensely enjoyed David Grossman’s A Horse Walks into a Bar (Cape) for its pitch-perfect black comedy and Jeet Thayil’s The Book of Chocolate Saints (Faber), easily the most original and formally inventive novel to come out of India in years.Uprooting her life, London-based Kamin Mohammadi relocated to bucolic Florence. Her glorious memoir Bella Figura is witty, intelligent and heartfelt in equal measure and will delight anyone dreaming of a summer holiday – or a brand new life – in Italy.Recently optioned to become a film, Katja Meier’s timely memoir Across the Big Blue Sea: Good Intentions and Hard Lessons in an Italian Refugee Home avoids easy sentiment in favour of honesty and humour. The African women we meet at this Tuscan refugee home are fierce, scared, brave, vulnerable — triumphant yes, but human too. A beautifully complex account.And finally, I cannot heap enough praise upon Freshwater, a daring, sexy debut. Raw and lyrical, Akwaeke Emezi’s semi-autobiographical narrative takes on sexuality, spirituality, family and more — all with a clarity that belies her 30 years.I basked in the interwar twilight of Cressida Connolly’s After the Party (Viking). The novel a beautifully written evocation of the era, and the woolly self-absorption of its party-going protagonist. However, it’s also a pitiless exercise in ideological revelation, as it becomes clear that the party in question doesn’t feature dancing until dawn and a sumptuous breakfast buffet, but men and women wearing black shirts, who greet each other with fascist salutes. In a year that’s seen bigotry of all kinds on the rise, and the storm clouds of nationalist intolerance gathering on the near horizons of Europe, Connolly’s novel achieves the rare feat of at once summoning that foreign country, the past, then returning us, uncomfortably, to a contemporary Britain with a burgeoning fatherland complex.I have just finished reading The Reactionary Mind (Oxford) by Corey Robin. So many writers and thinkers today, East and West, are questioning the rise of conservatism, populism and tribalism. What makes Robin’s book extraordinary is the long-term pesrpective he introduces in this book. Robin shows that Trump is not a break from the conservative tradition, in fact, he is the fulfilment of a tradition that goes all the way back to Edmund Burke and his reaction to the French Revolution. It is a deeply thought-provoking book with utmost clarity and astonishing depth.What struck me about Neel Mukherjee’s novel A State of Freedom (Vintage) was the mesmerising complexity and the sharpness mixed with compassion and empathy. All the stories are beautifully written, and while they remain semi-independent, they are also subtly interconnected. Long after I finished it I realized the characters were still with me, vivid, compelling, haunting.Janesville: An American Story (Simon \u0026amp Schuster) by Amy Goldstein is incredibly well-researched, empathetic and moving. Political experts and pundits talk about “the American working class” all the time, making massive generalisations without paying much attention to inidual stories, but this book is extraordinary in the way it sheds light on an industrial town in America’s heartland by masterfully combining analysis and storytelling.I’ve already read Tishani Doshi’s poetry collection Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods (Bloodaxe) but I know I’ll return to it many times. One of the poems talks about poets ‘holding the throat of life till all the sunsets and lies are choked out till only the bones of truth remain’ - that’s precisely what Doshi does in this intelligent, elegant, unflinching collection. It’s very much a collection for this moment in history, but one that will endure long past it.The publishing house And Other Stories has committed to making 2018 a Year of Publishing Women – I’m planning to work my way through their entire list for the year over the summer. First up: Fleur Jaeggy’s Sweet Days of Discipline, translated by Tim Parks. It is set in a boarding school in postwar Switzerland, the opening pages are spare and beautiful, with an intriguing darkness.This summer the book I’m telling anyone who asks me about is Guy Gunaratne’s In Our Mad and Furious City (Tinder), a novel that’s a piece of communal vitality, choral in its urgency, one that squares up to the history of ision, makes contemporary disjuncture come alive on the page, doesn’t flinch, and demands change right now. The book I’ll take with me on holiday is Michael Ondaatje’s Warlight. I love his writing, I wait for his books.Now that America has come to seem so unsettled and so strange, two books help us to become more alarmed. One is Michèle Mendelssohn’s Making Oscar Wilde (Oxford). It charts the early rise of Wilde, with special attention to how, during the 1880s, his lecture tours in America, a country beguiled by novelty and in need of excitement, made his name. As long as it was new, it seemed, America wanted it. Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room is set in the American prison system, but manages to be a novel with its own worldview and its own textures, as much as a chronicle of a system that holds more prisoners per head of population than any other country in the world. On a more uplifting note, there is a wonderful doorstopper called Gillian Ayres (ArtBooks), with a text by Martin Gayford and David Cleaton-Roberts and examples of Ayres’s work that will lift your heart.Do you want to understand yourself? To understand why you say and do what you do? To know why you, and the rest of our human race, are capable of paradoxical extremes, from compassion to cruelty (even within minutes of each other)? With humour, sublime insight and supportive data, Robert Sapolsky serves up all the answers in Behave, his gem of an explanatory masterpiece.Many of us feel that an occasional lie is fine, perhaps when trying to protect someone’s feelings, or when pressured to maintain political correctness. Lying by Sam Harris is a timely, well-reasoned treatise exposing how wrongheaded such beliefs are. It proves out the lack of utility in lying, in any scenario. Yet, that is not the reason I prescribe this book. Rather, it is the palpable sense of liberation and relief that you will feel when you practice what Harris preaches. Such is the truth about lying.My most beguiling read lately has been Rupert Thomson’s Never Anyone But You (Corsair), a beautifully written fictionalised account of the decades-long lesbian love affair between surrealist artists and anti-Nazi activists Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore. I’m currently very much enjoying Diana Evans’s novel Ordinary People (Chatto), which takes a forensic look at the pleasures and perils of marriage and parenting and modern London living. And, as a Londoner myself, and one who likes to make as many journeys as possible by foot, the book I plan to turn to next is Lauren Elkin’s Flâneuse (Vintage), which promises to be an inspiring a piece of feminist psychogeography based on the experiences of several notable female city-strollers including Jean Rhys, Virginia Woolf and Martha Gellhorn.What books are you reading this summer?

But the scale of Ryanair’s operations also means that quite a significant number of people could be affected,” he said.One concern for Ryanair is that any cancellation comes with the memory of last winter’s travails still relatively fresh. Thousands of passengers had their flights cancelled due to a blunder in the airline’s staffing roster.“Their brand is built on being reliable bastards,” said Dan Gavshon Brady, a strategist at brand consultancy Wolff Olins. “What the strikes threaten to do is question the reliability. They’re more resilient than others because they’ve never promised anything more than no-frills but deliver on what they promise.“But that also leaves them less margin for error, so when you get problems it threatens to affect your brand.”At one stage last year, it looked as if Ryanair might avert any escalation of tension with its labour force. In a reversal of the airline’s decades-old policy, O’Leary agreed to recognise trade unions, something he has once claimed would be less preferable than cutting off his own hands. It seemed like a watershed moment, albeit one forced by the airline’s staffing bungle.The mistake had left Ryanair desperately short of experienced pilots, giving them the whip hand over a management team keen to limit flight cancellations.O’Leary’s subsequent damascene conversion into a reluctant trade unionist was reminiscent of his 2013 vow to start being nicer to passengers – one made by necessity, through gritted teeth.A little more than six months later and unions representing both pilots and crew say recognitionhas not developed into engagement with their grievances.This time, while pilots in Ireland remain dissatisfied and plan to strike on 12 July, it is cabin crew who are most aggrieved.They have long complained of poor pay and working conditions and meagre employment rights as a result of Ryanair’s model of employing them via third-party agencies.As the  revealed last year, they are also subjected to disciplinary proceedings and public shaming if they do not hit sales targets designed to help Ryanair flog more scratchcards and perfume.Multiple crew unions, assisted by the the International Transport Workers’ Federation, have delivered a list of 34 demands to the company.The implication is that more strikes will follow unless the company comes to the negotiating table. “The onus is now on Ryanair,” said ITF general secretary Stephen Cotton.“Ensure that workers get the treatment they deserve, or more national unions may decide that strikes are the only way to make the company listen.“Ryanair has started to change, but we believe the culture at the top needs to change too in order to deliver on the promises it has made. “The close-knit corporate governance model that has been a feature of the company thus far is no longer appropriate for a major airline. An increase in independent representation on the board would give us greater confidence that Ryanair is serious about a new approach.” But Ryanair’s rapid growth and financial success remain core strengths and not everybody is convinced it will see the need to change.Chris Tarry, founder of aviation consultancy Ctaira, said: “Whilst this changes the rules of engagement at Ryanair the fact is that it starts from a position of the lowest costs and is consistently the most profitable airline.“There are different dynamics and flexing of muscles by labour but it’s all clearly manageable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccd9cdacb7fdb5d75c098fcb14d5a0d5d51d5f33/0_71_2100_1261/master/2100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20ac8b2daa392e54e7556aba0b325ec3","title":"big tech politics language","story":"The ground on which politics happens has changed – yet our political language has not kept up A Russian-fed misinformation campaign across Facebook and Twitter, plus powerful data-targeting techniques pioneered by the Obama campaign, helped propel Donald Trump into the White House.Big tech’s political fortunes have dimmed accordingly it is at risk of joining big tobacco, big pharma, and big oil as a bona fide corporate pariah.A growing number of thinktanks, regulators, and journalists are grappling with the question of how to best regulate big tech. But we won’t fix it with better public policy alone. We also need better language. We need new metaphors, new discourse, a new set of symbols to illustrate how these companies are rewiring our world, and how we as a democracy can respond.Tech companies themselves are very aware of the importance of language. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying and PR to preserve control of the narrative.In its public messaging, Facebook describes itself as a “global community”, dedicated to deepening relationships and bringing loved ones closer together. Twitter is “the free speech wing of the free speech party”, where voices from across the world can engage with each other in a free flow of ideas. Google “organizes the world’s information”, serving it up with the benevolence of a librarian.In light of the last election and combined market valuations that stretch well into the trillions of dollars, this techno-utopian rhetoric strikes a disingenuous chord. What would a better language look like?Most of the regulatory conversations about platforms try to draw analogies to other forms of media. They compare political advertising on Facebook to political advertising on television, or they argue that platforms should be treated like publishers and bear liability for what they publish. However, there’s something qualitatively different about the scale and the reach of these new platforms that opens a genuinely new set of concerns.At last count, Facebook had more than 200 million users in the United States, meaning that its “community” overlaps to a profound degree with the national community at large. It is on platforms like Facebook where much of our public and private life now takes place. A few big companies now operate enormous, privately-owned public spheres.The ground on which politics happens has changed – yet our political language has not kept up. We lack a common public vocabulary to express our anxieties and to clearly name what has changed about how we communicate and receive our information about the world.The biggest insight in George Orwell’s 1984 was not about the role of surveillance in totalitarian regimes, but rather the primacy of language. In the book’s dystopian world, the Party continuously revises the dictionary, removing words to extinguish the expressive potential of language. Their goal is to make it impossible for vague senses of dread and dissatisfaction to find linguistic form and evolve into politically actionable concepts. If you can’t name and describe an injustice, then you will have an extremely difficult time fighting it.In the late 19th century, rapid industrialization changed the social fabric of the United States and concentrated immense economic power in the hands of a few iniduals. The first laws to regulate industrial monopolies came on the books in the 1860s to protect farmers from railroad price-gouging, but it wasn’t until 1911 that the federal government used the Sherman Antitrust Act to break up one of the country’s biggest monopolies: Standard Oil. In the intervening 50 years, a tremendous amount of political work had to happen. Among other things, this involved broad-based consciousness building: it was essential to get the public to understand how these historically unprecedented industrial monopolies were bad for ordinary people and how to reassert control over them.Political cartoons offered an indispensable tool by providing a rich set of symbols for thinking about the problems with unaccountable and overly centralized corporate power. The era’s big industrialists – John Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie – were typically depicted as plump men in frock coats, resting comfortably on the backs of the working class while Washington politicians snuggled in their pockets. And the most popular symbol of monopoly was the octopus, its tentacles pulling small-town industry, savings banks, railroads, and Congress itself into its clutches.The octopus was a brilliant metaphor. It provided a simple way to understand the deep interconnection between complex political and economic forces – while viscerally expressing why everyone was feeling so squeezed. Its critique immediately connected.What would today’s octopus look like?In recent years, the “alt-right” has been particularly effective at minting new symbols that capture big ideas that are difficult to articulate. Chief among them, perhaps, is the “red pill”, which dragged the perception-shifting plot device from The Matrix through the fetid and paranoid misogyny of “men’s rights activist” forums into a politically actionable concept.The red pill is a toxic idea, but it is also a powerful one. It provides a new way to talk about how ideology shapes the world and extends an invitation to consider how the world could be radically different.The left, unfortunately, has been lacking in concepts of similar reach. To develop them, we will need a way of talking about big tech that is viscerally affecting, that intuitively communicates what these technologies do, and that wrenches open a way to imagine a better future.A hint of where we may find this new political language recently appeared in the form of the White Collar Crime Risk Zones app from the New Inquiry. The app applies the same techniques used in predictive-policing algorithms – profoundly flawed technologies which tend to criminalize being a poor person of color – to white-collar crime.Seeing the business districts of Manhattan and San Francisco blaze red, with mugshots of suspects generated from LinkedIn profile photos of largely white professionals, makes its point in short order. It seems absurd – until you realize that it is exactly what happens in poor communities of color, with crushing consequences. What if police started frisking white guys in suits downtown?The White Collar Crime Risk Zones app is effective because it functions as a kind of rhetorical software: not designed to collect data or sell advertising, but to make an argument. And while software will never be the solution to our political and social problems, it may, to hijack a slogan of big tech, at least provide a way to “think different”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f0418faffae44b3461d79d8a3b137eae700c0c5/431_768_5861_3518/master/5861.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d9649a8ea24217436b3c9c9e729e676","title":"peter preston guardian hero daily mail paul dacre","story":"I have a confession to make: I cannot claim to have known Peter Preston well. Not one for chitchat myself, our few social encounters invariably left me drowning in the sea of those famous unnerving silences, while my not infrequent mentions in his column were a mix of good, bad and, I suspect, deliberately elliptical.That said, Peter was a hero of mine. I\u0026nbspalways felt – and here you must forgive my presumption – that in his love of, his obsession with, his addiction to journalism, we were kindred spirits.As a young reporter on the Express when its circulation was about 4m, I would sometimes have a late dinner at the Kolossi Grill, known as the Colostomy, in the hope of catching sight of him. He was, after all, the journalist’s journalist. The editor’s editor.Peter has been described as a private, shy, socially\u0026nbspgauche inidual who eschewed the swanky\u0026nbspparties and glitzy first nights at which too many\u0026nbspof his trade loved to be seen hobnobbing with the\u0026nbsppowerful and the celebrated.I see a different man. I see a slightly lonely figure – one who was all too acutely aware that an editor who operates without fear or favour can’t really have friends.\u0026nbspAnd then again, good editors need to be outsiders because, let’s be honest, most people only befriend journalists to get something into a paper or –\u0026nbspmore pertinently – to keep it out.I also see a man who, even after the first edition\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbspgone, was glued to the backbench, a microwaved pizza and plastic bottle of plonk on his desk.\u0026nbspThis was not because he was against gossiping in\u0026nbspthe pub but because, frankly, even after a 12-hour day,\u0026nbspit was a wretched distraction from a job that had to\u0026nbspbe done. Like sharpening a headline, writing a cleverer\u0026nbspintro or\u0026nbspcropping a more dramatic picture. Because, let me tell\u0026nbspyou, when you’re fixated by journalism like Peter was, there’s virtually nothing more\u0026nbspimportant in life than\u0026nbsptrying to produce the perfect\u0026nbsppaper. And on the\u0026nbsprare occasions that you do, there’s no greater buzz on\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbspEarth.Now, I am not going to provoke my own lynching by\u0026nbspsuggesting that I’d have made a good fist of editing the . But I am going to risk a collective cardiac arrest in this congregation by offering you the view that – politics apart and actually, with the exception of his\u0026nbsppassion for Europe, I don’t think Peter was ideological\u0026nbsp– it’s not fanciful to say the man would have made a great editor of the Daily Mail.After all, he came from the lower middle class. He was instinctively anti-establishment. Politically, he was difficult to define, though on the unions he was almost Thatcherite. He believed, to the deprecation of too many of his colleagues to whom profit is a dirty word, that it was actually rather a good thing for a paper to be financially prudent and commercially successful. He was evangelical about the need for what he called “zing”. His mantra was “serious doesn’t need to be dull”. He initiated great women’s pages. In G2 he created a brilliant tabloid that has been imitated but never equalled.He was fascinated by popular culture, and determined  readers should not be excluded from the national dialogue because some of his staff had an aversion to anything that interested ordinary people. And his philosophy, outlined in his last media column, that readers in a jam should be treated like human beings and that a paper, by identifying with distress, becomes a functioning part of society rather than a commentary on its edges – should be the credo of every editor.Above all, he loved features and beautiful words and brilliant writers, several of whom the Mail poached. Others were rogues whom he tolerated because of the glory of their writing. And the making flesh of those wonderful words, and a manifestation of Peter’s genius for lateral innovation, was G2. Why, he asked, if\u0026nbspit effervesced with flair, wit and creativity, should a tabloid be downmarket. Inevitably, there were the quali-pop sneers. Jonathan Miller, in self-condemnatory words, called Pass Notes a pollutant infecting culture. But G2\u0026nbsphad it all: jaw-dropping covers, a dizzying range of\u0026nbspviews and voices, bold pictures, important investigations and profiles. G2 was both serious and salacious, even if there were, for my taste, a tad too many\u0026nbsparticles intellectualising the female orgasm. And\u0026nbspnot a week went by when, at its height, the Mail didn’t buy one of its articles.Now, I don’t want to overstate this “zing” factor, because ultimately Peter’s  was a very serious newspaper that broke important stories and pulled off some historic investigations. His specialists, particularly in Westminster, Whitehall, the City and sport, broke\u0026nbspan embarrassment of exclusives, as I knew to my cost when news editing the Mail in the 80s.He also, in masterminding the paper’s journey from narrow socialism to broad liberalism, created a unique tone in which writers with many different voices, left and right, coexisted. But then, Peter’s paper had a compassion, a burning desire to confront social wrongs, a reasonableness and a tolerance that eschewed dogma.Others have rightly said that by seeing off the malicious militancy of the unions, and launching those\u0026nbsphighly profitable classified supplements, Peter saved the  from oblivion.But ultimately, it was G2 and his daring redesign of the main paper – with its emphasis on creative white – that were hugely significant in the transformation of a somewhat austere, highbrow regional paper that haemorrhaged losses into a radical, young, modern, profitable, respected global liberal media brand that saw off the ferocious, predatory price-cutting of the Times, routed the incursions of the Independent and achieved, at its height, a  circulation of 500,000.In April, a\u0026nbspprospectus\u0026nbspannounces a new paper for Manchester. A month later, on 5 May 1821,\u0026nbspJohn Edward Taylor publishes the first Manchester  as a newspaper in the liberal interest.\u0026nbspCharles Prestwich Scott, a liberal thinker with strong principles, becomes editor of the  - a post he holds for 57 years.CP Scott buys the , becoming both owner and editor.CP Scott writes a leading article to mark the centenary of the paper that becomes recognised around the world as the blueprint for independent journalism and includes the line\u0026nbsp“Comment is free, but facts are sacred.”CP Scott retires as editor in favour of his son Ted.CP Scott’s death in January is followed swiftly by that of his younger son Ted Scott is killed in a tragic boating accident in April.\u0026nbspWilliam Percival Crozier\u0026nbspis appointed as editor.Ownership of the Manchester  is transferred to the Scott Trust to protect the paper, its independence and the journalistic principles of CP Scott.On 24 August the newspaper\u0026nbspchanges its title\u0026nbspfrom the Manchester  to the , to reflect the growing importance of national and international affairs in the newspaper.\u0026nbspThe editor’s office and major editorial departments relocate from Manchester to London. has a radical redesign, splitting the newspaper into two sections and introducing a new masthead.\u0026nbsp Unlimited (GU) network of websites is launched.The mid-sized Berliner format newspaper launched. It is the UK\u0027s first full-colour national newspaper.\u0026nbspA new digital operation,\u0026nbsp US, is launched in New York as a hub for  readers in the US. and Observer newspapers launch in a new tabloid format and the website and apps are given a redesign.I am told that in later years Peter was, rightly, proud of the ’s online achievements. Whether he was ever reconciled to the digital revolution, though, I doubt. The reason, of course, was that he was, quite simply, a print man. He loved that magical symbiosis of newsprint, pictures, headlines, fonts and beautiful words that at their best can make a paper a functioning part of society rather than a commentary at its edges.Inevitably, sadly, those Fleet Street skills needed for that magic symbiosis are dying in an internet age that seems to have a voracious need for free, somewhat crudely expressed, round-the-clock information and gratification. Yes, of course, journalism will survive and may one day flourish again. But it will be different. Whether it will in future have the creative beauty and sheer power of Peter’s , I don’t know. But I do know – and there’s no presumption here – that, for the sake of our industry’s collective memory, we should salute a very great man of print.• Paul Dacre is editor of the Daily Mail"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb5ee923e936433d40942a7932c4c9174d584e2e/1672_626_2808_1684/master/2808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e559c6d07dcf7caaaa9466c598f7c5","title":"jim broadbent dix interview dull margaret graphic novel","story":"What does an Oscar-winning actor do with time on his hands? Team up with cartoonist Dix to tell the story of a vengeful 17th-century peasant You may not think you know Dulle Griet but you probably do – she’s the breastplated peasant striding across a war-torn land towards the mouth of hell in one of the most famous paintings by the 16th-century Flemish master Bruegel the Elder. Bertolt Brecht saw her as his own Mother Courage – “the Fury defending her pathetic household goods with the sword. The world at the end of its tether.”Jim Broadbent’s version of her is rather different. “She’s a plain woman whose tragedy is to look like me,” says the actor, whose dignified recent screen roles, such as the curmudgeonly camera seller in Julian Barnes’s The Sense of an Ending or the tragic Gloucester in Richard Eyre’s King Lear, can lead one to overlook an important biographical detail: he cut his acting teeth in the 1980s as one half of a grandiosely named comedy duo, the National Theatre of Brent, hamming it up as Marie Antoinette or the Virgin Mary in uproarious re-enactments of the Bible and the French revolution.Broadbent, as his friends have told him, is a “notoriously picky” actor, with the result that, while he seems to be a constant presence on stage and screen, he quite often has time on his hands. His original idea was to make a film of Dull Margaret, with himself in the title role. He wrote the screenplay and showed it around, but when the money failed to materialise and he began to feel the zeitgeist moving against female impersonation, he decided to put her in a graphic novel instead. And who better to approach for the illustrations than the Welsh cartoonist Dix, whose Roll up! Roll Up! comic strip for the  had enlivened his day for two years in the early 00s with the antics of a ghoulish circus troupe. “I just felt we shared a sense of humour,” Broadbent says.The Dull Margaret who stars in their new book may be Griet’s darkest incarnation yet. She’s a potato-faced wraith adrift in coastal marshlands who emerges naked from the sea and is not above chopping the hand off a hanged man to enrich a putrid love potion, which she smears on her face in an attempt to witch away her loneliness.Leaping from the end of a jetty on a broomstick, she plops ignominiously into the sea, only to re-emerge two pages later in what looks like a gastroenterologist’s bad trip – a writhing tangle of orange dragon coils looming out of a palette of sombre greys and browns. And so her misfortunes continue, not least because of her own bad behaviour and her inability to choose between money and love.Is she mad? Or monstrous? No, no, no, protests Broadbent, gallantly. “I love her. I have total sympathy for her and enjoy her struggle. In a heightened way, she’s looking for what we all want: comfort, a reasonable standard of living and love. She gets robbed and abused and humiliated, and that sets her on a journey to take back control.”It turns out that this is only the fourth time author and illustrator have met. They collaborated via early-morning emails, because Dix, who lives in Hay-on-Wye and has a day job at a computer software company, does his art work between 11pm and 4am.Dix picks up the story, confessing that it took a while for him to “find” Margaret – “one was too fat, one was too neurotic and one was too vulnerable”. This was partly because he thought Broadbent was after someone who looked like one of his Roll Up! Roll Up! circus grotesques (the horizontal comic strip format rules out long, skinny people).It didn’t help, he adds, that that at first Margaret had no nose. “She was beginning to look a bit aquatic, so we thought later on we’d give her a nose – which was a nice thing to do.” Broadbent’s blue eyes widen at this revelation. “I wasn’t aware of your nose, no-nose journey,” he fires back, though he agrees it was important that she had no fat on her – “she has no carbs in her diet”.Given that Margaret is a mythical figure who rides a broomstick and stirs severed hands into potions, this sudden swerve into dietary literalism might seem surprising – but it underlines how deeply rooted the story is in the marshy coast of Lincolnshire, where Broadbent and his artist wife, Anastasia Lewis, have a cottage.It’s also deeply indebted to Bosch’s hellscapes, Goya’s witches, Daumier’s pictures of travelling acrobats and Rembrandt’s glowering Low Country landscapes – not to mention Dix’s own oddball aesthetic. “Lack of pupils in eyes is something I’m quite fond of,” he says. “It makes people more expressive.” And creepy? “I don’t think it’s creepy at all – and I think that’s something we share.”The pair’s shared sensibility is never more apparent than a six-frame sequence in which Margaret happens upon a bloated white animal corpse, which I mistakenly describe as a sheep. It’s a dog, Dix corrects. Well actually, says Broadbent, it was originally a pig. But they’re both delighted for it to be pointed out because it was the last page they composed. Its single speech bubble – “Cor, what a pong” – is a tribute to the Dandy and Beano comics that Broadbent loved as a child, and which helped to form his sense of comedy.It’s all quite clownish, he says happily, striding out into the streets of Soho, where (despite being unexpectedly long and lean) he is immediately recognised by a giggling trader as Horace Slughorn, the “well-upholstered” potions master who turns himself into an armchair in the Harry Potter films. As another of his creative soulmates, the theatrical hell-raiser Ken Campbell, once put it: “It’s only true if it makes you laugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ebc4cf5b705f75613488abbc632673dcd9b6bf/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257723e2d947c903cb1d0c45bd786fa9","title":"denver on tap are these the best brews in the us","story":"Artisan ale lovers, hop to it: with dozens upon dozens of top breweries and an annual beer fest to boot, Denver’s craft beer scene is the toast of the country.

Could I find my place?On an overcast day in Oxford in 2003, a few weeks into the first year of an English literature degree, I found myself doing something out of character. I broke a rule. Rather than going to my scheduled tutorial, rather than sitting on the ungiving sofa and offering halting analysis of Middlemarch, I slotted a note into my tutor’s pigeonhole and darted out of Wadham College. I hadn’t told anyone I was going I was unsure if I would ever come back.I was unaccustomed to disobedience. I went to a large, fiercely aspirational comprehensive where for years I had been a picture of compliance. I had exceeded predicted grades and been garlanded at prize-givings. It followed that the result of such cheerful tractability and success should be continued tractability and success at the University of Oxford, the very place I was fleeing.As I rushed in my battered Converse, my heart thudded in weird patterns. I kept dropping things, stopping to scoop up my belongings. I couldn’t wait to get back to London, to my own bed, to my schoolfriends who were grownup-ly working in bars and bookshops, saving for gap-year adventures. I flopped on to a seat on the coach, alternating between weeping and snoring all the way down the M40. It was a bloody awful end to a bloody awful few weeks.Before I got to university, I had imagined that the much mythologised pressure of the place would come from on high: disciplinarian, gowned fellows would swoop around making all manner of unrealistic intellectual and organisational demands. But, on arrival, I found it was other students and their attitude to work that was most tricky.In the junior common room, over sweaty brie and cranberry paninis, the writing of essays was exclusively referred to as having an “essay crisis”. At dinner, in the grand dining hall, panicked girls asked how many paragraphs I had managed to write, how many more I intended to write that evening, if I was gearing up for an “all-nighter”. Was I worried about not having enough to say? Wasn’t I concerned that my ideas might be too thin? The whole business of thinking about texts – something I loved – was reframed as a pursuit full of risk and without pleasure.When studying for my A-levels, I had worked in a much more self-contained fashion. I did my homework in peace and quiet at the dining table. I stopped for regular dance breaks, stomping around the front room to MTV Base. But at Oxford the production of work came with an oppressive theatricality. I started to secrete myself away in my room, rather than engage in yet more competitive grandstanding about word counts. But there were other aspects of my fellow freshers’ behaviour that bothered me. I am not now, nor have I ever have been, a particular fan of Eminem’s oeuvre. But throughout that first fortnight the sentiments of the curt line “y’all act like you never seen a white person before” from The Real Slim Shady circled through my mind. The interactions I had with several students made me feel that my blackness was something curious, difficult to handle.At one of the endless icebreaker events, a history student told me that I must be really “into African beats” (what even are African beats?). A girl from another college launched into an expectant monologue about her gap year in Togo, keen to hear of my own “experiences of Africa”. My hair – arrayed in a cloud of messy twists – was the subject of profound speculation and inquiry. When I ventured into other Oxford colleges, the porters who guarded the entrances eyed me quizzically and checked my ID card with suspicion. In all fairness, my blackness was a surprise. As far as I could tell, in 2003 I was the only first-year undergraduate black male student reading English literature in the entire university. In my college, I was one of only two black freshers. (According to the official records, there were 21 British students who identified as black who accepted a place at Oxford that year. The total number of British students admitted was 2,940.)Lots of my closest friends at school were white and middle class, as were most of my teachers. So being in the minority was not unfamiliar. But in my A-level English class, there were people with Jamaican, Spanish, Polish, English, Pakistani, Irish and Nigerian heritages. Whiteness was surrounded by all kinds of racial ersity. So the very particular, ubiquitous whiteness of Oxford – a whiteness so self-confident that it didn’t notice itself, never needed to think critically about itself – struck the 18-year-old me. On many occasions in those first few weeks, it was my blackness that fellow newcomers found worthy of (awkward) conversation. Part of me now thinks about these interactions in an amused way often, it was youthful gaucheness. But I also have to be honest: those encounters – or microaggressions – left me feeling alienated and conflicted. Making these strangers face up to the cheapness of their interest in my heritage seemed unfriendly. So I remained silent, smiling, complicit. I knew that, if I were to launch into an anti-racist challenge, there were very few people of colour to come to my aid. I was fraught and sad, full of complicated anxieties about my sexual as well as my racial identity. How, I wanted to know, do you exist and survive as a black man in Oxford? How do you exist and survive as a black, gay man? I remember going to the welcome drinks for the university’s African and Caribbean students’ society. It was in a little basement bar filled with people drinking sticky shots and fluorescent cocktails. I largely withdrew I remember chatting with a Congolese zoology postgrad who looked as despondent about his surroundings as I did, without allowing the conversation to get very far. I spent the evening skulking by the exit and thinking I should be focusing harder on integrating with my white counterparts, rather than hiding myself away with the black folk. Did this society exist mainly because these young black people felt unwelcome at Oxford? I doubt things are very different for today’s BAME students – a few months ago, the admissions figures revealed that more than a quarter of Oxford colleges failed to admit a single black British student between 2015 and 2017.What I recall most vividly about those first few days, as I walked among sandstone and privilege, was feeling noticed and observed. Trying to shake off that sense of intense surveillance was what made me take the coach home on that grey Monday afternoon.My mother was gentle with me when I turned up without warning on her doorstep. For a few days, she left me to my own devices, letting me mooch around our maisonette. She offered me bowls brimming with her piquant chicken soup. Mum took her time before asking what had happened. I said I wanted to take a year out. She made a small and knowing snort, before calmly and evenly saying: “No. That is not the answer. Not the answer at all.” I needed, according to Mum, to find a way through whatever difficulties had made me run away, rather than dodging and delaying and deferring. I was, as she saw it, more than clever enough to figure it out.My mother can sometimes be a stubborn soul: if she sees one sensible way of doing something, then that is the way it will be done. In my earlier teenage years, such rigidity had sometimes created tension between us, but now, amid all of my unhappiness and fuzzy thinking, my mother’s certainty was useful. And kind. Three days after I ran away, Mum sent me back to Oxford with washed laundry, Tupperware full of delicious jollof and the memory of her keen glare. On the journey back, I thought of a trip we had made to Ghana a few months before I started at Oxford, when my mother and I went to bury my grandmother. Ghanaian funerals are protracted, demanding affairs, but throughout the noisy, painful process my tiny mother was the epitome of grit and poise. When I returned to my desk, I sometimes quietly remembered that, hoping I had inherited some of her resilience.I also thought about how university was a special, singular opportunity to experience things beyond the narrative of adversity young black men sometimes find themselves mired in – or have thrust upon them. I didn’t want to be another black boy crushed by a different kind of system. So I resolved to really, really enjoy myelf. I wrote a couple of shoddy plays. I wrote some outlandish essays – my favourite one argued that John Donne and Tracey Emin were, like, the same? I wore silly costumes to fancy dress parties – a recalcitrant baby one week, a 1950s secretary the next. I had “gatherings” in my room where people stretched condoms over the smoke alarms so we could puff away on our Marlboro Lights. I stood in the middle of a packed, sweaty house party and – doing what felt like the unimaginable at that point – confidently snogged a boy in front of everyone. I certainly don’t think I ever “mastered” being at Oxford. There were many occasions when I shoved my head under my pillow for a pause. But mostly I began to feel more in charge of the kind of time I was having.Not only did I learn about Tennyson and Woolf, I also learned how to articulate my emotions and anxieties. By opening up, I discovered that, beneath the shiny appearance of coping, those who would go on to become some of my closest friends had their own problems: profound homesickness, experiencing misogyny, classism, regionalism, the difficulty of starting a relationship in a strange new world. Sharing these stories was restorative. Talking through some of the absurdity I was presented with – the fragile public school boy who was affronted when I had the gall to say I “wasn’t sure” about the work of a poet he liked, or the girl whom I overheard describing me to someone as “erm, you know, the, erm, one who… erm…wears the scarves?”, rather than calling me black – was liberating. When my parents came to my graduation, we decided to begin the day by taking a quick turn around the college grounds. I walked them through the entrance I had bolted from years before. I pointed out the window of my first-year room now someone else’s bland posters surrounded the large mirror on the back wall.I remembered how, in my first spring term, I had stood in that room and looked in the mirror as I got myself ready to go on a date, with a girl. Two friends knocked on my door. Perhaps they had an inkling that going out with a girl might not, in the long run, be what I was after. But because they understood that I was trying to figure out what I actually wanted, and because it didn’t matter whether I was interested in boys or girls, or both or none, and because they wanted to see me happy, they bundled in, full of enthusiastic questions. They dispensed casual advice and rigorous critiques of my outfit. We whacked on some Beyoncé and danced around the room.The date was a total failure: she brought her friend with her, which I was not expecting the bar was too noisy to hear anyone speak. After extricating myself, I plodded home over the cobbles, overcome with embarrassment.But I tried as hard as I could to think otherwise: I reasoned that, when I got back to college, I would tell my friends what had happened. They would demand that I didn’t skimp on the detail. There would be red wine to ease the storytelling. They would be tickled by the ridiculousness of it all. And they would come up with consoling and clever wisdoms – observations I could never have come up with on my own.• Michael Donkor’s debut novel, Hold, is published on 12 July by Fourth Estate at £12.99.

In three games Kazan has claimed the winners of 11 World Cups. First Germany went, insipid against South Korea. Then, in a full-blooded epic, Argentina were blown away by France. And then fell the biggest of them all, Brazil, outwitted and outbattled by Belgium, who will face France in Tuesday’s semi-final.Brazil had chances. A few ricochets in the box did not fall their way. The hysteria that always surrounds them, the sense of desire and expectation, perhaps becomes at times inhibitive. Tite, almost certainly, will be blamed, because that is what coaches are for, but his half-time switch to a 4-4-2, bringing on Roberto Firmino in place of Willian and shifting Gabriel Jesus to the right, did stem the Belgian tide. The problem was that by then they were already 2-0 down, having been eviscerated on the break by Kevin De Bruyne. Renato Augusto did pull one back, heading in Philippe Coutinho’s chip with 14 minutes remaining, but Belgium clung on.Kazan has seen some astonishing matches in this World Cup but this, perhaps, was the best as Tite, even-handed as ever, acknowledged. “It was a great game with two teams of incredible technical qualities,” he said. “Even with all the pain I feel now and the bitterness, I say that if you like football, you have to watch this game and you will have pleasure if you are not emotionally involved. Triangulations, transitions, saves, what a beautiful game!”Roberto Martínez may have been almost derided by the end of his time in the Premier League but he deserves enormous credit for Belgium’s victory. His approach was bold, startlingly so, setting out a team that looked like the sort of lineup one would use to chase a game if a goal down with half an hour to go – as, of course they had been against Japan in the last round. Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli, heroes of that comeback, were included and the system was a surprising one: a 4-3-3 with De Bruyne deployed as a false nine and Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard rampaging down the flanks.Both the players Martínez brought in were involved in Belgium’s opener, as was the deployment of De Bruyne. Dropping deep, he sliced open the defence with a through-ball to Fellaini whose scuffed shot yielded a corner. Chadli delivered to the near post and, as Gabriel Jesus and Fernandinho jumped together, the ball deflected in off the midfielder’s right arm.What was really striking, though, was how dangerous Belgium were on the break. They rode their luck to an extent. Thiago Silva bundled an early corner against a post and Paulinho missed his kick when well-placed. Thibaut Courtois made a number of fine saves and bodies were put on the line again and again. But that was always likely to be the case. This, after all, is a Brazil side that had won 20 of their 25 games under Tite and were averaging more than two goals a game. Belgium were always going to have to endure and survive. But they also cut through Brazil over and over again.De Bruyne ran the game, Brazil seemingly unable to decide who should pick him up. Hazard and Lukaku, pulling wide, regularly had space to run into. After a Fernandinho error, it was Lukaku who was the architect of the second goal, carrying the ball forward from his own half, beating Fernandinho and Paulinho and then laying the ball right to De Bruyne. A step inside, a glance up to measure the strike and the ball was flashing beyond Alisson’s right hand into the bottom corner: a brilliant goal and the first time Brazil had conceded two in a game under Tite.Neymar, after all the criticism of his histrionics, was relatively well-behaved but his involvement was so fitful that Thomas Meunier was emboldened to make attacking sallies down the Belgium right. There was even, slightly bizarrely, an incident in the second half when he tangled with Fellaini and fell in the box, then seemed to discourage the Serbian referee, Milorad Mazic, from checking VAR.Marcelo, Coutinho and Neymar had always looked an adventurous left side for Brazil here, it was overwhelmed by the Belgian right of Meunier, Fellaini and Lukaku. It was not the collapse of four years ago, or anything like it, but it was, again, a Brazil side unable to handle an opponent adept on the counter.Neymar flickered. Firmino slowly imposed himself. A Jesus e, a Douglas Costa run, the surges of the substitute Augusto could not save them. Courtois made a brilliant tip-over from Neymar in the final minute of injury time. Belgium were exhausted, barely able to carry the ball into the Brazil half on the counter, but they held out and Brazil, like Argentina and Germany before them, succumbed in Kazan, the graveyard of the greats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969e3939129c2d5419fe25cfb9c2566309ebc52c/0_41_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5466ec8423fc90d4cf2789384d07af0","title":"cristiano ronaldo juventus real madrid confident","story":"Juventus are increasingly confident of signing Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid, with the Portugal forward having agreed terms on a four-year contract worth a staggering €30m (£26.5m) a season.Ronaldo’s future at the Bernabéu stadium has been in doubt since the victory over Liverpool in the Champions League final in May, when the 33-year-old hinted he could be about to leave by stating: “It was very nice to be at Madrid.”Having signed a five-year contract with the triple European champions in November 2016, Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, had hoped Real would offer him an extension but it has so far failed to materialise. There have been rumours of a breakdown in the relationship between the player and the club’s president, Florentino Pérez.Ronaldo has already spoken to the Juventus chairman, Andrea Agnelli, and indicated his desire to move to Serie A, with the Italian champions increasingly encouraged to believe a deal for the five-times Ballon d’Or winner could be done.Despite his release clause being set at €1bn, Juve have offered €100m (£88m) to Real and must now persuade Pérez to accept a fraction of the price they could demand. Talks are understood to be continuing between him and Mendes, with the agent thought to be line for commission worth up to €10m.“If it happens, it will be a new chapter and a new challenge in his brilliant career,” Mendes said to Portuguese newspaper Record after a meeting with Real’s vice-president, José Ángel Sánchez. “If Cristiano Ronaldo leaves Real Madrid, he will remain eternally grateful to the club, the president, all the staff without exception, as well as the Madrid fans throughout the world.”Gianluigi Buffon is set to complete his free transfer to Paris Saint-Germain after undergoing a medical on Friday.

A firm outstretched top hand from Jordan Pickford to save the Colombian penalty, followed by an Eric Dier winner, made the sucker-punch 90th-minute equaliser worth the heart-wrenching stress.As a group we came to Russia refusing to believe what we considered to be over-hyped depictions of blood-thirsty Russians chomping at the bit to get their hands on some England fans. We were aided by the fact that one of us, Max, had been based in Moscow for three years and we trusted his judgment when it came to the reception England fans would receive.Safe to say, though, we were not expecting to spend our first night in St Petersburg bar-crawling our way along Nevsky Prospekt with a group of Zenit St Petersburg ultras. Their astonishment, verging on awe, at meeting someone “from the real Great Britain”, to put it in Kirill’s words, was a shock. Yet it was clear that Kirill and his rather brutish-looking friends were genuinely excited to show us around their beloved “Piter”, as they referred to it.Max was the only member of our group to attend the first two England matches, in Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod, but the atmosphere at these was much the same. A real cocktail of incredibly enthusiastic underdog supporters, largely open-minded England fans and a big addition of friendly, hospitable locals.The only issues in Volgograd were the swarms of midges, getting harassed for photos by Tunisians for foolishly wearing a retro Algeria shirt the day before the match and being threatened with “the hammer” by a 60-year-old drunk Scouser for daring to ask for a replacement beer having been drenched by his pint as he knocked over a table.After our first few nights the message was clear: England are as welcome here as any other nation. The queues of Russians in Volgograd and Nizhny wanting to take photos with England fans and flags were a testament to this.Our first chance to all meet up came in Kaliningrad where we received a call from an organiser of a Fans’ Embassy friendly match taking place at the Baltika stadium. Having already sampled a couple of the local beverages we were probably not in the best shape to be playing football, but it seemed too good an opportunity to turn down.We played two matches: a 2-0 loss to the local Baltika Kaliningrad fan side and a 2-1 defeat by a well kitted-out Belgian side. The tone was friendly and the local media were delighted to hear that our experiences had been nothing but positive. All the teams congregated afterwards for the local cameras and the fans joined in, as much as they could, with each other’s songs.Despite a pair of ripped shorts and an unwelcome breeze for Howard, who played his first game in goal for 10 years, and an eye-opener for the rest of us on how not to prepare for a match in the future, it was a great experience and an unexpected treat before what turned out to be a dud of a game the next day.However, our trip to the strikingly German-looking area of Russia had already been made worthwhile by witnessing Germany’s exit in a pub dominated by ecstatic Mexicans chanting “Ko-re-a” incessantly at full-time.Although we are well aware you never really see the true nature of a country during a World Cup, the excessive negative press aimed at Russia pre‑tournament failed to hit the mark on what has been an incredible party. The political mess between Britain and Russia has clearly not affected locals’ ability to greet travelling fans with a full “ryumka” of vodka and a smile on their face.Follow Max Doyle on Twitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612168f587754bc53a1c9b900d450e8e0789d2e2/0_287_2769_1662/master/2769.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb4bd3bb44139f0241f7a51cbd864b1d","title":"gareth southgate world cup england best opportunities we ever have","story":"Three steps from football immortality the England manager discusses the importance of the public’s support, the value of squad harmony and the reasons he failed in club managementAs a child he had the team kit, the old Admiral one with the red and blue patches from the 1982 World Cup in Spain. Strictly speaking, his own football career was limited to Crawley Traders under-12s at the time. Yet Gareth Southgate will tell you he always had his dreams, even at that age. When he wore that kit he was Bryan Robson, captaining his country, winning the World Cup.We are sitting in an upstairs room of the Cronwell Park, one of the beachside hotels in Repino, and as Southgate reminisces about his first memories of this tournament the thought occurs that he and his players have the opportunity to create their own history now. One more win would put England in their first World Cup semi-final for more than a quarter of a century. Two more would mean a first final since 1966. Three would be football immortality. No wonder that the man sitting here, preparing for a quarter-final against Sweden, is the most popular person in England right now.Even when he argues there are different layers to his personality – “I’m very conscious I’ve got a lot of faults, the same as everyone, and I have done plenty of things wrong” – he cannot actually list what precisely that entails. All the same it is obvious, Southgate being the man he is, he would rather turn the praise on his players, the coaches, the back-up staff – anyone, in fact, but himself.“There was a big thing made of me going up to the Colombia players to console them after the game,” he says, to cite one example. “For me, that was just a natural response. You have been in a battle with another team. There’s huge respect for the fact they have pushed us all the way and, by the way, I always think it is easier to do that sort of thing when you have won rather than when you have lost. The mark is when you’ve been beaten, and how you deal with that. I mean, it’s easy to be magnanimous in victory, isn’t it?”Possibly, yet the point here was that Southgate made a beeline for Mateus Uribe, one of the players whose failure in the penalty shootout put Colombia out of the competition. Southgate, after all, knows a thing or two about being in that position from Euro 96 and the ordeal of “knowing straight away it would be a major issue for the rest of my life”.Already he is discovering that the life of a successful England manager – or a semi-successful one, as he would say – means being asked about more than just kicking a piece of leather round a stretch of grass. There have been requests during this tournament for his opinions on Brexit. He has been asked about the Putin stand-off and whether, on his return to England, he will be setting out his vision for the way his own country is run. Gareth Southgate for prime minister, anyone?Another time, maybe. For now he would rather focus on the next match and, at the end of the tournament, his intention is “disappearing as quickly as I possibly can and staying out of the way of everything ... the nice thing is I might not have to travel as far away as I would have if we’d had a really bad tournament.”The point is not lost on him, however, that he is now an ambassador and spokesman for his country, with the power to influence people. “The players have that opportunity as well,” he says. “They have a voice, too. They can influence young people, especially from the areas where they came from. They can give hope to them. We’re not a team that just turns up, waltzing around, strolling around, thinking we’ve got an entitlement. We’re lads who have come from Barnsley and Leeds and Blackburn and that’s so important for Saturday because I always think Sweden like to point out that we’re paid this and that, and we’re the team of entitlement, when I really don’t think that is the case for this group.”In the process, Southgate has taken a sledgehammer to the theory that managing England is the Impossible Job. “In life there are really complex, difficult jobs and some are more complicated and difficult than others. But when you look around at inventions, or records that have been broken, you have to tell yourself that anything is possible.His team selection for the Belgium match was a case in point, making eight changes in a deliberate ploy to involve his fringe players (reducing the possibility of splits behind the scenes) while making sure his first-choice XI was fresh for the next assignment. “I could easily have been distracted, influenced and affected by ‘Oh, if I make that decision that’s not going to be popular’, knowing it is going to open ourselves to criticism.” England’s 1-0 defeat that night did indeed lead to a flurry of hysteria from outsiders who could not grasp the logic.Heady times, indeed, and it is the way Southgate has gone about his business – modest, self-deprecating, generous with his time, always respectful – that has endeared him to so many people. His response, for instance, to being asked about the “slightly questionable lyrics” of the Atomic Kitten song that has been turned into a supporters’ chant in his honour: “Not as questionable as most of the lyrics of songs about me in the past, so long may that continue.”Spend any time in his company and you will hear him emphasise the “harmony” of his squad. After games Southgate always refers to the players who did not feature. He cares, he really does. “I am watching Phil Jones, Gary Cahill and Danny Welbeck train at such a high level and we won’t succeed without them. They are bloody unfortunate not to be in the side and it is only a consequence of the way we have been playing. You don’t succeed unless there is harmony, unless they push each other, and the lads recognise that.”“It’s great. We have, as a group, been through so much already. Phil Jones’s wife giving birth, now Fabian’s. All the staff are away from their families for such a long period of time, as well. We know that what we are trying to achieve is huge and it’s easy for people to say: ‘Well, blimey, we’d all give up six weeks of our life to experience what you’re experiencing.’ Nevertheless, there is an impact and I am very conscious of that. It has been lovely to have some of the families come in, to have the kids around the hotel and meet the parents.”If the Football Association has any sense, the logical step is surely to make this a long-term project and trust Southgate in the way Germany have with Joachim Löw for the last 12 years. That appeals to Southgate, too. But equally he goes back to the point that he has been in football long enough to know how quickly perceptions can change.“In any club there comes a point – and it’s the same with the national team – where people have heard the message enough. They’ve listened to the soundbites. The players will want a different voice. The press and the public will want a different voice. That will happen at some point.For the time being it is enough that he has turned England into a fully functioning and genuinely likable team. When Southgate took over in September 2016, on an emergency basis, it followed Sam Allardyce’s 67-day reign, with England’s reputation not so much low as subterranean. The previous summer there was the defeat by Iceland in Euro 2016. The fans were bordering on mutiny. For Southgate, unashamedly patriotic, it was galling to see the disconnect between team and supporters. But no longer.“My belief was always that the desire for the national team was there but it was almost like we’d had so much pain we wanted to push it to one side and not admit it. You put things down because you don’t want to get hurt at times.And now here we are, one victory away from the possibility of emulating Bobby Robson’s team in Italia 90 by reaching a World Cup semi-final. Southgate’s eyes light up when Robson’s name is mentioned and he recalls a story about his first experience of club management. “He came to Middlesbrough to talk to me and give me support. It was very special for me because he recognised the difficulties of being a young manager. He was an absolute gent. I’d met him a few times as a player, too. I remember being injured once at Aston Villa and at half-time he walked 15 yards the other way from the tunnel to come and see if I was OK.”That, however, feels like a long time ago now. Whatever happens on Saturday, Southgate has shown it is possible to embrace the England team again. And these are moments to cherish. “I’m bloody proud of being English and I’m so pleased that football has such a great ability to unite people and bring positivity in moments like this. That is really special. To effect something like that is really special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228ea1bd06f3dfc6d77e8ff9c8f8d0a58fcd9066/0_61_4400_2639/master/4400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f070476de00dc1345cb07462f5f88635","title":"stanislav cherchesov weathered storm raise russia game","story":"The hosts began the World Cup as the lowest ranked side in the tournament but their durable manager has guided them to a quarter-final against CroatiaAn ambitious manager with an ice-cold demeanour on the pitch, Stanislav Cherchesov has withstood two years of criticism to shape Russia’s most successful World Cup squad from what once looked like its weakest in history.Resembling a mustachioed police captain sent down to clean up a crooked precinct, the Osettian-born former goalkeeper has instituted his physical, inexhaustible style of football while rarely cracking a smile at pitchside. “I believe this is only the beginning so I have to save my emotions for the future,” he told reporters after Russia’s shock defeat of Spain, a match that looked thrilling in retrospect but largely came down to 120 minutes of football comparable to a war of attrition.He was pilloried in the press for his decisions to leave out of the squad key Russian players with whom he has feuded in the past and for a decision to shift to a four‑man defence weeks before the tournament. But his defensive tactics have taken Russia further in the World Cup than they have gone in a generation, including under prestigious foreign managers such as Guus Hiddink and Fabio Capello.“The biggest thing you could say he has done is to withstand the criticism,” said Sergei Kiriakov, a former teammate who played with Cherchesov on the post-Soviet CIS national team in 1992 and for the Russian squad in 1994. “He was always very ambitious, very sure in himself.”Born in Alagir in Russia’s North Ossetia region, he began his career at Spartak Ordzhonikidze – now known as Spartak Vladikavkaz – already sporting his trademark moustache, before moving up to Spartak Moscow in 1984. There he served as understudy to Rinat Dasayev, the Soviet goalkeeper in the famed 1980s squad, under the Russian coaching legend Konstantin Beskov, who became the first coach to lead a Soviet club side to a European final.His career took off just as the Soviet Union was crumbling, starting as a goalkeeper at Spartak from 1989 and earning a spot in the national team in 1990. “He was very disciplined and he’s bringing that to the players now,” Kiriakov said.The duo were in the side in 1992 going through one of the toughest periods in Russia’s history, playing under the flag of the Commonwealth of Independent States.Cherchesov left for Germany soon after, playing several seasons for Dynamo Dresden and then for six years for the now defunct Tirol Innsbruck, ending his career at Spartak in 2002.He began managing Austrian teams in 2004. He was devoted to fitness and never drank or smoked, said Kiriakov.“He never wanted to give away his place in the starting lineup, as the starting keeper,” Kiriakov told the . “He fought for that position. There was a really strong lineup of competitors.”Still it was a surprise, Kiriakov said, that Cherchesov had risen to his role as leader of the Russian national team. “I never imagined I was playing alongside the future manager of the Russian team.”His rise as a manager has taken him from Austria to Moscow to a defunct Sochi squad, Perm and even Grozny (Ramzan Kadyrov once complained on Instagram that Cherchesov favoured foreign players during his term at Terek).It has also been notable for his locker-room feuds with some of the league’s biggest stars. Fyodor Smolov in an interview to Sovetsky Sport spoke about being pressured to leave Moscow Dynamo by Cherchesov, despite feeling he was “no worse than a number of the other players”.But the biggest scandal to follow Cherchesov has been over not calling up Igor Denisov, the talented but testy Lokomotiv midfielder, after the two blew up at one another after a high-stakes defeat by Dynamo.“Get in the showers, I’m going to break your neck there,” Denisov recalled the coach saying during one exchange, sparked by a decision not to play a teammate.Commentators before the World Cup believed the team was a mess.“It’s impossible to understand the logic of an unprofessional,” Vasily Utkin, a well-known football commentator, said of Cherchesov on Sport-FM before the first game against Egypt.“The team has now been trained for a long time by this brass statue. I don’t know what else to say. I would like to speak as little as possible about the national team.”Now Cherchesov is ascendant. Critics say that Spain’s poor play was the deciding factor in Russia’s victory last week. But a win against a dangerous Croatia side on Saturday would put that criticism to rest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b73815f468d8ee62a41eac670f4846e24c47242a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c08c2b07d4461bfc31f898de53abee9","title":"fifa world cup media scrum wait list barney ronay","story":"The Wait List – and the frantic ticket-seeking scrum surrounding it – is a window into the Fifa machine and its ability to wring every last drop from a global passionAnd what did you see my blue eyed son? And what did you see my darling young ones? I saw a Peruvian TV anchor with a sweat-soaked pastel blazer. I saw a Thai radio crew in a state of mild hysteria. I saw the man from the Deccan Herald being elbowed by Spaniards. I saw 200 tired, flustered people with digestive problems carrying Sochi 2016 rucksacks and pleading in 17 languages for an overflow desk.It is generally assumed Bob Dylan’s haunting, visceral lyrics to the song A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall, quoted above, were inspired by a vision of impending apocalypse. Perhaps the terror of the Cuban missile crisis that year or the spectacle of America’s gathering military-industrial complex.Less well known is the fact the song was written shortly after Dylan had made a trip to the 1962 World Cup in Chile where, as an accredited acoustic entertainer, he happened to be present in the Santiago press centre to witness the first ever Wait List media ticket distribution process. This could just be coincidence. Dylan has never specifically denied the connection.A column about the haunting, visceral spectacle of the World Cup media ticket Wait List. Nobody’s going to read that, said every quietly disappointed desk editor ever. But you never know.The Wait List, which will be in swing an hour before each of this weekend’s fixtures, is a glimpse into the Fifa machine. It is also at times a very funny experience, provided your idea of a good joke is having your face pressed into the armpit of a massively stressed 17-stone Argentinian cameraman.There are around 5,000 accredited media at Russia 2018. These are ided into sub-categories of written press, broadcast crews and non-specific well-dressed people who sit around talking and laughing when you’re 10 minutes off deadline.The Wait List is how these various types get match tickets and mixed zone passes when they’ve missed out in the ballot, either because they lack specific A-list entitlement for that game or because of some gruelling logistical balls-up.And so they come as kick-off looms, crammed in with all the other people on the verge of failing to complete the job they travelled thousands of miles to do, having begged their bosses or bank managers for the chance, gathered at the railings of the Fifa desk like refugees staring across the Volga at the last boat out of Stalingrad.Among the sneaky elbows, the Putas and Scheisses and Pizdets, in this place where almost every single person is from a different country, you can find a camaraderie too. There’s the Scandinavian man I pushed in front of in Moscow who said, ah, you reviewed my book six years ago. The Ghanaian woman who finds the food a bit indigestible. The Indian bloke I’ve stood next to in the Wait List at two, maybe three successive tournaments and who nods curtly each time as though this is the local Tesco  or the bus stop.Eventually, the Fifa lady will arrive. The excitement cranks up. The faces become more gaunt with longing. Someone will crack at this stage and start yelling or trying to break through the barriers. Silently, the Fifa helpers glide forward and lead away the man from Peru who has lost his wallet and is sleeping in a cupboard and hasn’t got into a single game yet. He looks remorseful. Respect it. Respect the Wait List.The Fifa lady looks calm. But then she has to. She’s all we’ve got. I’ve come to appreciate the Fifa lady. She’s scrupulously fair. She sticks to the list in strict order of arrival. She has a patient, pitying air, like the head nurse in the bed-wetting terminal loser ward. I trust her. I obey her. I … love her.As the air crackles with event glamour, the names finally start to come. “Mr Zheng, China Daily.” “The Congolese Football Association.” Each one draws a hateful hush. At the last World Cup there was a heady occasion where I was the first name read out off the Wait List (“BIRRRNY!! ROWWWNAY!!”). To my enduring shame I came skipping up like a contestant on a TV game show, waving the ticket above my head like it was a voucher for a brand new fridge freezer.There will be a lot of this kind of thing when England play Sweden in Samara, a massive game in a non-massive stadium in the shirt-soaking heat of the south. As for the semis and the final, well, the scrum will be monster‑scale, a mass three-day wrangle for access.This is just the scale of Big Football now, the ceaseless clamour around an ever-more engorged global beano. The current World Cup has confirmed what we knew, that the planetary obsession has simply intensified, that we cannot get enough of this stuff, cramming down great dripping handfuls, gasping always for more.The TV viewing figures are vertiginous. Fifa announced this week it has had 89m hits on a social media platform I’ve never even heard of and at times football does feel a little overpowering. In the Fifa grasp it can seem atomised, something to be relentlessly wrung out, a commodity dispensed only from behind the VIP rope.Where did all this obsession come from? Can it just keep on happening? Will we ever find ourselves un-hooked? Is enough ever really enough? How many Wait Lists must a man walk down? The answer to all of these, my fellow guests behind the railings, is blowing in the Fifa-partnered wind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2894dd45450d8fffe602285729b45d2f3c6efe5a/0_284_4236_2541/master/4236.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6af14dbb1a422b024a269e014bf6fd1e","title":"world cup 2018 brazil belgium reaction sweden england buildup live","story":"Shamelessly stolen from Bill Edgar’s excellent numbers column (£) in the Times: England have won five of their last eight World Cup games in which they have worn red, and one of their past eight in white. Today they wear red.A unique opportunity to watch Rio Ferdinand shout at a mirror:The first pictures of the day from Samara have landed, with fans already decked out and ready to go:Croatia meanwhile have only played Russia three times, winning once and drawing the others.The head-to-head record between England and Sweden could hardly be more balanced: after 23 games both teams have won seven and drawn nine. England have slightly outscored their rivals with 35 goals, to Sweden’s 31.It looks like the Belgian papers were quite happy with their team’s performance yesterday:“If nothing else, then we all owe a debt to whoever it is who got Sam Allardyce to shoot his mouth off and get sacked,” writes Charles Antaki. “Supposing that the England team he’d have managed had got this far (unlikely), the hubris and flag-waving would have been unbearable as it is, with Southgate it’s at about acceptable levels. Also Sam would have looked ridiculous in a waistcoat.”It’s hard to watch England’s progress through the tournament without thinking about how it might have gone with Allardyce in charge. We’ll never know, of course, but fundamentally the reason Southgate has succeeded (and whatever today’s result he has done that) is that he approached every element of his preparations with a kind of humility and intellectual rigour that Allardyce, like Capello, and most of the people who preceded him, would never have brought.Pickford’s Euro 2012-era tweets are also quality. He was 18 then, with an 18-year-old’s preoccupations:A key question answered: what was Jordan Pickford preoccupied by during the last World Cup?“I wonder if now we could have some sort agreement amongst pundits and journalists that in the next major tournaments they don’t lazily and automatically put Brazil and Spain down as possible winners?” pleads David Penney. “Spain are no where near the team they were 8 years ago and Brazil have not been world class for 12 years. “Can we all just stop this now? Won’t someone think of the children?”I don’t think any team came into the tournament in overwhelmingly positive fashion, but of them all Brazil’s build-up was probably the most positive. Their history might make them an obvious pick before any World Cup, but I don’t think they were a bad one on this occasion, and if yesterday’s match had gone only a little bit differently they would still be in the running.“I’m in Sweden, surrounded by 1000 Swedes,” writes Steve Powell. “But I will be sporting traditional England Supporter attire this afternoon ... a bright pink sunburnt back.”This tweet was apparently actually sent by the @visitstockholm Twitter account. It’s since been deleted:Here’s another picture of the World Cup reaching distant corners of the world, in this case the village of Alua in Mozambique:There is talk of there being 10,000 empty seats at the Samara Arena for the England game today. Looking at the ticketing website now, there is availability in Category 1 ($365 each) and Category 2 ($255 each). It’s the only match with tickets available at the moment.News just in: England’s players have gone for a walk!Here are some Brazil fans before and during yesterday’s World Cup quarter-final against Belgium. But where are they?Answer: they’re in Arsal, a town 124km north-east of Beirut, Lebanon. They seem to have a thing about Brazil there.Here’s Andrew Roth on Stanislav Cherchesov, the Russia manager:Resembling a mustachioed police captain sent down to clean up a crooked precinct, the Osettian-born former goalkeeper has instituted his physical, inexhaustible style of football while rarely cracking a smile at pitchside. “I believe this is only the beginning so I have to save my emotions for the future,” he told reporters after Russia’s shock defeat of Spain, a match that looked thrilling in retrospect but largely came down to 120 minutes of football comparable to a war of attrition.He is still on Instagram, though:Important World Cup wager dept update. Weirdly, Beckham seems to have fled Twitter since this agreement was reached last night:Barney Ronay has written about the wait list for World Cup press tickets:Here are some things you may not know about Harry Kane, written by yours truly:Hello world! I’ll start with a few front and back pages from today’s newspapers:Alas, that’s all the time in the chair for me, Richard Parkin, today - to take you ever closer to Harry Kane’s next heroic chapter (and of course that other little matter taking place in Sochi later on) is the irrepressible Simon Burnton. Keep your emails, tweets and comments flying through on another day where we ask: is it coming home or going home? Thanks for your company! And so the slow build to England’s clash with Sweden begins, as the Three Lions attempt to reach the final four of a World Cup for just the third time in fifteen attempts.And for supporters all around the world that heady cocktail of nerves and excitement begins to take grip in the very pit of your stomach.Matt Honeycombe writes from the bottom of the earth with a novel approach ahead of today’s match:Sun is going down here in New Zealand, slow cooking chicken wings in a Jamaican Jerk sauce with Carolina Reaper chillies - the hottest peppers in the world. We figure - get the pain out of the way and any of the potential England roller-coaster of hurt that may come will feel like nothing. Come on England!I love it. Keep a little something up your sleeve, Matt, maybe a seed to rub into an eye to ensure the tears, either of rapture, pure agony, or a heady fusion of both, continue well after the full-time celebrationscommiserations begin.But, of course we couldn’t move on from last night without a passing farewell to Neymar, who joins Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as spectators for the business end of Russia 2018.This prodigious talent of Brazilian football - third on their all-time topscorer list behind Pele and Ronaldo - and yet for so many at this tournament the very embodiment of the worst of football with his playacting and histrionics.In fairness, after becoming an internet sensation for his basic idiocy during the match against Mexico, it did appear the superstar was a slightly more reformed character last night gone was the precocious pot-noodle hair, and on occasions when caught, the striker did appear to keep the full-body revolutions to three or under.What do you think - has the VAR-era “found out” play-actors? Will we see less of this kind of behaviour in the game going forward or conversely will we see more, given the hounding of referees to “go upstairs” that we’ve seen from players thus far?But let’s see what you’ve made of the overnight action - here’s “Lardons” with some praise for Belgium’s coach:I’ve always liked Martinez. He is the personification of the joy, positivity and dare to dream elements of the game which first attracted to me to it and led to my decades long servitude to the cruel mistress of football.The fact people still try to malign him or dismiss his abilities - motivational and tactical - is astonishing and something probably rather British. Evidently somebody in the Belgium FA could see what he’d bring to a group of frustrated, blunted but potentially thrilling attackers.Evidently not an Everton fan, there.“Deepcoverpoint” thinks however all that tactical brilliance may not be enough:Hard to see anyone knocking over France based on their potential and last two performances. When they break our into open space, as Belgium also showed today, France has the fluency, speed and finishing to quickly turn a match.While “Cesc_12” touches on another secret weapon the Belgians have among their ranks:Thierry Henry is the real brains behind Belgium. It’s no coincidence that Belgium are the tournament’s top scorers, with 14 goals, and the GOAT is their assistant manager. I’ll admit I did have the thought that this puts one of the all-time greats of French football in a very tricky position. Knowing the French squad intimately (as he no doubt does), what inside intel might Henry be able to share with the Belgian backroom staff? And would he? It’s a hell of a pickle to be in - to choose between professionalism and one’s own country. Maybe a phonecall to Iran’s Carlos Queiroz might help?Some fresh news with a bearing on our first quarter-final clash today, and it’s not been the ideal matchday preparation for England’s opponents Sweden, who have had a fire alarm go off at their hotel, prompting an evacuation.You don’t imagine consummate professionals like the Swedes would be too put out by that, but then you never know the micro-superstitions that many professional athletes cling to. I know an Opera singer who will only eat tuna on crackers exactly two hours before EVERY performance. Let’s hope the Swedes all got their herrings in, exactly how they like it.That said, it’s not exactly the distraction New Zealand’s All Whites experienced ahead of their crucial continental playoff against Peru in Lima where jet planes low-swooped the team hotel at 3am in an attempt to unsettle their opponents pre-match. Now, that’s dedication.I’m sure coach Janne Andersson and his chargers took it all in their stride, with the well-mannered Swedes almost certainly dealing with the commotion with trademarked “respect”:And speaking of the Golden Boot race, if you need a refresher, here’s how the table currently stands:Phwoar. And to think “Our ‘Arry” is in action tonight! You’d imagine only Lukaku or Griezmann could catch the Tottenham striker from here. No?And so for seemingly the empteenth time the tricolour of black, red, gold will be flying proudly at a World Cup semi-final except this time, not the horizontal version of Germany, but the vertical version of Belgium.One of the coolest wee graphics I’ve seen lately was this humble offering to Romelo Lukaku and his involvement in Belgium’s dramatic late winner against Japan:And wasn’t he immense, Lukaku. As Nick Ames reminds us with this thoughful offering:Many people might take a casual glance at the Golden Boot standings and think a Kane and Lukaku pairing at the top has all to do with the relative weakness of their group opponents but when both are in the form they’ve displayed at this tournament you can see that they’re a genuine handful for even the world’s best defences.In the Football Manager era where all of us are suddenly instant André Villas-Boas’ it was also a remarkable match for those that are obsessed with tactics and formations.Often in football you’ll see that the side that blinks first and adjusts their tactics to adapt to their opponents might cede a psychological edge. But there’s no doubting Roberto Martínez’s shrewd tweaks pre-game had a massive influence in this one. I enjoyed the Spaniard’s post-game comments, where interviewed immediately after the whistle the former Swansea, Wigan and Everton supremo was congratulated for his tactics. To which he replied quick as a flash that tactics are nothing without the execution, or buy-in to said plans from the players and in that sense the much-maligned Marouane Fellaini (and his mini-Marouane be-wigged mate, Axel Witsel) were utterly superb in the middle of the park shutting down passing lines to Neymar and Coutinho, and stifling the space for Brazil’s creative playmakers.And yet! For all that, had Renato Augusto finished a golden-opportunity to grab an unlucky brace shortly after his lifeline header, had Thiago Silva’s early kneed effort not bobbled agonisingly onto the post, had Fernandinho not inadvertently found his own net what a very different game of football this could have been!Heartbreak for Brazil and their fans, after a second half in which they created more than ample opportunities to force at least another 30 minutes - and who out there (Belgium not included) wouldn’t have wanted to see that.And so we know the first of our semi-finalists: France v Belgium. And what a mouthwatering clash that threatens to be.But before we get too far ahead ourselves, let’s take a moment to relive that game an encounter that even the grieving Brazilian coach had to admit was a classic: “Even with all the pain I feel now and the bitterness, I say that if you like football, you have to watch this game and you will have pleasure if you are not emotionally involved. Triangulations, transitions, saves, what a beautiful game!” Jonathan Wilson again with the match report worth a re-read even if you have already.They showed the trademark hunger that has defined this over-achieving football nation for generations, but sans-Cavani, and aided by a gift from the unfortunate Fernando Muslera, it was always going to be an uphill battle for the South Americans.It never fails to raise a lump in your throat to see the heartbreak when a team goes out, irrespective of the manner in which they go. José Giménez becoming another poster boy for the fickle fates of football. One moment you’re up and the next you’re very, very down.French coach Didier Deschamps was the very loped-smile picture of contentedness post-game, claiming his side displayed “more mastery” and were “deserved” winners, hinting ominously for Belgian fans that the best was yet to come.And while many might have taken umbrage to the occasional lurking moments of “gamesmanship” (or “shithousery” if you prefer the ’s re-terming of that) of which some among his number showed great adeptness (*cough* Lucas Hernández), few perhaps could argue that his side weren’t the better side.But before all that, to our earlier fixture, where another hugely respected veteran of the South American game, Óscar Tabárez, and his fighting Los Charrúas have run their race.Given the manner of his involvements at the previous two World Cups, it’s almost a subdued exit for the enigmatic Luis Suárez the nation’s all-time leading scorer and the original enfant terrible of a pre-Neymar world (and post Nicholas Anelka?). There were no outrageous contributions in Russia from the man from Salto, who in truth, had half of the beating heart within his chest ripped out when partner-in-crime Edison Cavani was ruled out of this most crucial of encounters.If you missed any of the earlier action, Stuart James was the man on the ground, and here’s his match report:And for seemingly the fifteenth time this remarkable World Cup, we begin the morning after the night before bleary-eyed, shell-shocked, stumbling uncertainly around.After Germany’s stunning exit Jonathan Wilson captured the post-dystopian mood brilliantly in the opening to his match report, and if you’ll allow the indulge it bears repeating once more, with totemic rivals Brazil now leaving Russia as well:This, then, is how the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper. There are certain events so apocalyptic that it feels they cannot just happen. They should be signalled beneath thunderous skies as owls catch falcons and horses turn and eat themselves.Yes, the Seleção, are going home. And perhaps even more startling is the fact that, on balance, it’s not even an undeserved result. 210 million people might see it otherwise (please don’t @ me) but in a stunning demonstration of clinical transitional football Roberto Martinez’s Belgium rocked world football with a first-half performance for the ages. They rode their luck in the second, and Brazil were uncharacteristically wasteful in front of goal, but for the neutral observer, it certainly was the kind of football you’d love to see at a World Cup.Breathless, end-to-end, open, dynamic football. And the wise old owl, Tite, and his much-fancied men have made six (soon to become four) nations very, very, excited about the prospect of what, only weeks ago, would have been considered an unlikely World Cup triumph.And like that, South America left the building, as Russia 2018 reverts to an all-european Euros-style knockout competition.The loss of Cavani pre-whistle perhaps the biggest impediment to Uruguay’s potential progress, but in fairness it perhaps would have taken something special to beat a French side brimming with the talent they have at their disposal. But the big news, in a tournament that’s not been light on high drama, is the departure of five-time champions and one of the pre-tournament strong favourites, Brazil, after they fell to Belgium’s “Golden Generation” after one of the most dynamic and thrilling opening halves of the tournament.And so, now, to find out who will book their spot in the second semi-final, the plucky Swedes, “it’s coming home”-mentum England, Modric and mates Croatia, or a host nation that refuses to lie down.Yes, we’ve two more cracking fixtures tonight so prep your meals, line up your slippers and pre-warm your kettle, because this is big-tournament football at the pointy end, and who could honestly even begin to pretend to know what’s in store today.As always, this is a train that picks up all passengers, irrespective of tendency-to-pun, quip or muse.

As we step off the train, both of us are thinking about the casual damage that may await us after leaving the house and its contents in the care of the youngest one and the middle one for 30 hours: appliances broken, leaks sprung, supplies decimated.Outside the pub next to the station, my wife slows her step.“Do you think he’s working today?” she says. She means the youngest one.“I think he said he was,” I say.“Shall we say hello?” my wife says. It would be, of course, the last thing he’d want: an unscheduled parental drop-by at his place of employment. He would be obliged, in the circumstances, to treat us like customers.“Absolutely,” I say.The tables under the umbrellas outside are full, but the pub’s interior is dark, cool and quiet. At the far end of the room, a big-eyed urchin is hard at work behind the bar, answering the drinking needs of the alfresco clientele. “It’s still funny,” I say.“It’s true,” my wife says. “Why is it still funny?”“Because it’s so incongruous,” I say. “It’s like leaving an eagle in charge of a newsagents.”The youngest one is pouring a pint while simultaneously adding soda water to two glasses. As we approach, he looks up. His eyeballs make a brief, world-weary survey of the ceiling, then return to the pint glass in his hand. “You’re back,” he says.“Oh yes,” my wife says, settling on to a bar stool. “Have we got time for a swift half?”“I think we do,” I say. “What sort of ales do you have, barman?”He looks along the range of taps, and then back at me. “These,” he says.“Two, please,” I say.“Is the dog still alive?” my wife says.“The last time I saw the dog, it was alive,” he says, filling one glass, then another. He cocks his head in the direction of the next customer, taking another order.“He looks taller in here,” my wife says.“That’s because the floor behind the bar is six inches higher,” I say.“That’s lucky,” she says. “Otherwise, he’d have to stand on a chair to reach the taps.”“Here you go,” he says, setting down two halves without making eye contact.“This is fun,” I say.A smartly dressed 10-year-old boy approaches the bar with a menu in one hand and £30 in the other. The youngest one leans across the bar to take his order. For a moment, their heads are both bent in grave consultation. The youngest one points to something on the menu and raises his eyebrows. The boy nods sternly and hands over the notes. My wife turns towards me. “Have you seen Bugsy Malone?” she asks.“Uh-huh,” I say.Drinks finished, we head to the nearest shop to stock up on things we’re almost certainly out off: milk, beer, ice-cream. We walk the final leg of our journey home in blistering heat. “You know what?” my wife says. “Good on him.”“Yes,” I say, not quite sure who we’re talking about.“He’s had that job for nearly a year,” she says. “He works hard.”“They all work hard, when they work,” I say.“I suppose,” she says.“It’s possible all our children have discovered some latent sense of responsibility,” I say.“Really?” my wife says.“A discovery that, for obvious reasons, they prefer to conceal from us.” At the corner, I can see that our house is demonstrably not on fire.“Do you have keys?” my wife asks as we reach the step. “Mine are right at the bottom of my bag.”“We won’t be needing them,” I say.When I open the door, the dog crashes into my knees. A minute later, the middle one comes down the stairs. “Yo,” he says.“Are these yours?” I say, holding up a set of keys.“Where were they?” he says.“Sticking out of the front door.”He smiles broadly. “Yeah, that makes sense,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8193e8aa85d4a3e89701091d920d7548229846e7/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=247d686bf904ae2941d266cd8f30dc46","title":"what to buy at plant sales","story":"Our gardening expert on trusted plants to look out for at plant salesAfter a slice of cake and a cup of tea, one of the joys of visiting a garden in summer is the plant sale. Going home with a little of something you liked is often as sweet as the cake. My favourite plants sales are not fancy – the pots might not match and the labels might be recycled from yoghurt pots – but they are full of much-loved plants: playful self-seeders, and tough biennials and perennials that can dodge slugs and snails. There’s often a bargain to put in a gap you’d hoped would have filled out by now. Here are some truly trusted plants to look out for.Equally good is G. psilostemon, which will self-seed around its peppy magenta flowers with black centres mean it’s hard to dislike. It can grow up to 1.2 metres tall if it has something to lean on, so is not suitable for small spots, unless you want it to drape itself all over everything else. There’s the slightly meeker cultivar ‘Patricia’ that grows to only 75cm high. If your garden is cast in shade, look out for the lovely feathery foliage of G. clarkei ‘Kashmir White’, with red-veined white flowers that will slowly spread.Finally, dame’s violet or sweet rocket, Hesperis matronalis, or the very pretty white variety H. matronalis var. albiflora, does love to dance around the shady spots of the garden and you might end up weeding a fair few out if you don’t cut it back hard after flowering. It has sweet-smelling clusters of violet blooms that are covered in butterflies by day and moths by night, and flowers into August.

The perfect pub, with a roaring fire, wisteria-fringed beer garden, barrels of Black Sheep and Scampi Fries, is as important a house-hunting criterion as price and location. But do you go for quantity or quality?Pubs are an endangered species, though. The Campaign for Real Ale’s (Camra) Good Beer Guide says 30,000 have shut since the early 1970s, forcing survivors to up their game. Some, like Camra’s national pub of the year, the Cricketers Arms in St Helens, go for ingenuity (a whisky and gin bar).

Other versions, based mainly on olive oil and containing anything from beetroot to avocado, I’ve always rejected as phoney imposters, but after making today’s three wonderful chickpea spreads with not so much as a gram of tahini among them, I couldn’t help but call them anything other than, well, “hummus”.This yields enough cooked chickpeas to make two of today’s other dishes. I like the idea of having two contrasting hummus dishes in one meal, but not everyone will share that sentiment. Luckily, cooked chickpeas freeze very well just defrost them and bring back up to room temperature before using. I say to cook the chickpeas for 45 minutes, but it can take substantially longer, depending on variety and freshness, so cook them until they’re completely soft.Soak OvernightPrep 5 minCook 45 minMakes 600g250g dried chickpeas1½ tsp bicarbonate of sodaSaltStart the day ahead by soaking the chickpeas overnight in plenty of cold water and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda. Drain and refresh, then put in a large pot with 1.8 litres of water and half a teaspoon more of bicarb. Bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, lower the heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes. Add a teaspoon of salt and cook for 15 minutes more, until the chickpeas are very soft when squashed between your fingers, but still hold their shape, then drain.Grab some crusty bread or pitta to mop up the fried aromatic oil with this hummus.

Blitz for about two minutes, until you have a smooth paste (you may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl a couple of times).For the fried aromatics, heat the oil in a medium pan on a medium heat, then gently fry the chilli, garlic, ginger and cinnamon for five minutes, stirring every once in a while, until the garlic is just starting to brown. Add the coriander stalks and fry for a minute or two more, until the garlic is a light golden brown and the chilli aromatic. Transfer the solids to a plate with a slotted spoon (reserve the oil) and sprinkle generously with flaked salt.Spoon the hummus on to a large plate, creating a large well in the centre with the back of a spoon. Spoon the oil into the well and drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice. Top with the fried aromatics and fresh coriander, and serve.There’s a bit of work involved here, but this is a glorious dish to delight any hummus lover. Separating the quail into breasts and legs is a little tricky, so ask your butcher to do it if you’re unsure (use the carcasses for stock or gravy). Another option is to use boneless chicken thighs, and adjust the cooking time according to their size. You’ll need four long metal skewers (or wooden skewers soaked in water for 10 minutes).2 tbsp olive oil1½ tsp ground allspice1½ tbsp pomegranate molasses, plus ½ tbsp to serve1½ tbsp soy sauce1 tsp lemon zest2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tsp maple syrup2 thyme sprigsFlaked sea salt and black pepper4 quail (1kg), breasts taken off the bone, legs and thighs cut off in one pieceFor the parsley salsa10g parsley leaves, finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2 tbsp olive oil1 lemon – zest finely grated, to get ½ tbsp, then juiced, to get 1 tbspFor the hummus300g freshly cooked chickpeas (see introduction to first recipe)½ garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 lemon – zest finely grated, to get 2 tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp1 tbsp olive oil100g Greek-style yoghurtFlaked sea salt and black pepperMix the first eight ingredients in a large container with a teaspoon and a half of flaked salt and plenty of pepper.

Discard the thyme.Mix all the salsa ingredients with a generous pinch of flaked salt and a good grind of pepper.Put two thirds of the chickpeas in a food processor with the garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, oil, 80g yoghurt and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and blitz smooth. Transfer to a saucepan and set aside.Heat a griddle pan on a high heat until very hot. Lay in the skewers skin side down and grill for five minutes on each side, until crisp and golden brown, then leave to rest for five minutes.Put the pan of chickpeas on a medium-high heat with the remaining 100g whole chickpeas and gently heat for a few minutes, until warm. Transfer to a platter with a lip and stir in the remaining 20g yoghurt, so you have streaks of yoghurt through the chickpeas.Arrange the quail skewers on top of the hummus. Spoon on the salsa, finish with a drizzle of pomegranate molasses and serve.Grilling and marinating mushrooms really enhances their meatiness, making this a hearty vegetarian option.

Put the garlic, oil, lemon zest and juice, thyme and maple syrup into a large bowl with a teaspoon of flaked salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Heat a large griddle pan on a high heat, then lay in the mushrooms, well spread out (depending on the size of your grill, you may need to cook them in batches), and grill, turning often, for about eight minutes, until the mushrooms have dark char-marks on all sides. Add the griddled mushrooms to the bowl with the oil mixture and stir to combine.Grill the chilli in the same pan for four minutes, until fragrant, then roughly chop and add to the bowl. Leave to marinate for an hour or two.For the hummus, put the chickpeas, cooked garlic, remaining tablespoon of oil and the lemon juice in the small bowl of a food processor with a tablespoon of water and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, then blitz to a smooth paste – about two minutes (you may need to scrape down the sides a couple of times).Spread the chickpeas in the base of a shallow bowl, and make a large well in the centre with the back of a spoon.

That included a proposal to “create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products” after Brexit.Tory Brexiters voiced concern at the agreement, while soft Brexiters expressed relief. Andrea Jenkyns, a hardline MP, complained that “British businesses will continue to be a rule taker from the EU” and said she would “pray” that the detail was not as bad as she feared. Heidi Allen, a moderate, said she was “pleased to report Theresa May has secured cabinet agreement for a sensible, soft Brexit”.Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the influential European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservatives, said he would not vote for a plan which crossed the red lines set out in Theresa May’s manifesto.Rees-Mogg said he was waiting to see the full details of the proposals but added: “This will require legislation and if, when we get the detailed legislation, it turns out that it is a punishment Brexit, that it is keeping us in the European Union in all but name, I will stick to the Conservative party’s manifesto commitments and will not vote for it.” He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he would wait to see if the red lines had “been turned pink” but warned that the common rulebook proposal could make “trade deals almost impossible” if it meant regulations would have to apply to any goods coming in to the UK. He added that “it is possible that this deal is worse” than a “no deal” Brexit. “As with eggs: an egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the prime minister promised. “The prime minister will, I’m sure, stick to her word – that is crucially important – but I will certainly stick to the Conservatives’ manifesto commitments and will not vote for something that doesn’t deliver Brexit.”Cabinet Brexiter Chris Grayling acknowledged the deal could lead to issues in negotiating a US trade deal. The transport secretary said: “I didn’t campaign to leave the European Union to have a different specification of motor car on sale in the UK to the one that’s on sale in France. This is simply saying that we will effectively sell the same products across Europe as we do now – it’s what business does and would do anyway, nobody produces a different product for one country.” Asked what the common rulebook with the EU on food products would mean for the proposed US trade deal, Grayling told Today: “There may be inidual issues to address in future trade talks.” On Thursday, when the common rule book proposal was first leaked, hardline Brexiter cabinet ministers and Conservative MPs voiced alarm that it could prevent the UK striking a trade deal with the US, which has different standards in goods and foods, such as allowing chickens to be washed in chlorine.But May was able to release the text of a three-page agreed statement before cabinet, following a relatively undramatic day of discussions, sat down for dinner to listen to No 10 communications chiefs make a presentation on how to sell the new proposals.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, appeared to react warmly to the proposals, noting in a tweet that the “Chequers discussion on future to be welcomed. I look forward to white paper. We will assess proposals to see if they are workable and realistic”. The CBI and the Institute of Directors (IoD) business groups also voiced relief.The prime minister made clear that she expected ministers would be sacked if they did not remain in line with her soft Brexit blueprint. She wrote to Tory MPs to explain her plans and included a clear warning about discipline: “As we developed our policy on Brexit, I have allowed cabinet colleagues to express their inidual views. Agreement on this proposal marks the point where that is no longer the case and collective responsibility is now fully restored.”Ministers had been told to surrender their phones in line with what was described as “standard practice for cabinet meetings” when they arrived at Chequers at around 10am with none of their advisers present, meaning that they were not able to immediately present their version of events.May had asked everybody with the right to attend cabinet to be present, a total of 29 people, meaning that a greater proportion of those present were expected to be loyal to her. Despite speculation that some ministers could stage a walkout through the Buckinghamshire countryside to the nearest train station, there was no sign of Boris Johnson or any other hard Brexiter leaving before dinner. One minister said that Johnson “was actually very big about it and by dinner spoke passionately in favour of making it work”.The cabinet agreement represents a rapid turnaround in a 24-hour period after the prime minister had been forced on to the defensive after the “common rule book” proposal was leaked. Seven cabinet ministers had met to discuss their concerns at the Foreign Office, led by Johnson and including Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, David Davis, Liam Fox, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom.Johnson went on to see David Cameron on Thursday evening at a meeting in which the accounts of what happened were disputed on Friday. Sources close to Johnson tried to claim that the two men agreed the plans presented by the prime minister were “the worst of all worlds” and that he told his fellow Etonian he should finally take pride in Brexit, having called the referendum.Cameron’s former spin doctor Sir Craig Oliver rebutted the claims, saying that the former prime minister had “always understood compromise will be necessary”. He added: “It’s also wrong to claim he sees himself as ‘the father of Brexit’. Why would that be true when he fought it tooth and nail?” Others added that Cameron had even persuaded Johnson not to resign from the government. It will now be the job of cabinet members to brief MPs in the party as to the merits of the negotiating strategy proposed by May that will form the basis of a Brexit white paper due to be published next week.The government statement formally proposed a new “third way” for handling customs, ending the cabinet standoff between May’s once preferred “customs partnership” and the Brexiter’s “maximum facilitation” models. It said that the UK would propose a new “facilitated customs arrangement” which would see the UK levy its own tariffs and then refund the difference if the goods went on to the EU.One Tory MP said that Jacob Rees-Mogg had messaged members of the European Research Group’s WhatsApp group telling them not to post their thoughts immediately, but instead to email them to him, giving his email address from the investment company he co-runs. Stephen Martin, the director general of the IoD, said: “News that an agreement has been reached is very welcome. Our members have wanted cabinet to come together and put the interest of the country first, so firms across the UK will see this as a positive step forward.”Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, would not be drawn into the detail of the trade deal row but, speaking earlier on Friday, reiterated Donald Trump’s desire to reach agreement with Britain. “The president has been clear since the beginning of his term – he wants to do a bilateral trade deal and he’s really ready to step up on that the minute he gets the go-ahead to do it. And he’ll get it done fast, as I know it’s a major priority for him,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4837532de372ba6b647bd9cf7d10f26de1b6a3ff/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80c166098b302475c0e43b6a49f3d0c2","title":"what the cabinet has agreed at chequers brexit meeting","story":"Theresa May and her cabinet have reached agreement on how to approach final Brexit talksAfter a long day of talks at Chequers, the cabinet has agreed what Theresa May hailed as a “collective position for the future of our negotiations” on Brexit. It might yet be modified amid Brussels objections or MPs’ concerns but below is the plan as agreed, as set out in a government statement:The statement says the UK will “maintain a common rulebook for all goods” including agricultural products after Brexit, with the UK committing via treaty on continued harmonisation, thus avoiding border friction.Parliament would have oversight of such rules, it adds, and can choose to not continue harmonisation “recognising that this would have consequences”. However, the proposal says protections in areas such as the environment, employment laws and consumer protection would not fall below current levels.The arrangement would see looser arrangements for services, with a recognition this will involve less mutual access to markets than currently.The plan proposes what is termed a “joint institutional framework” for interpreting UK-EU agreements, to be carried out in each jurisdiction by the respective courts. However, decisions by UK courts would involve “due regard paid to EU caselaw in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook”.The system would include joint committees, or binding independent arbitration in the case of disputes, which would have reference to the European court of justice (ECJ) “as the interpreter of EU rules”.The government statement puts forward the idea of the so-called facilitated customs arrangement, May’s new attempt at a compromise system that could be acceptable to her cabinet Brexiters and to Brussels.This would see the UK and EU avoid hard borders by being treated as a “combined customs territory”. Under this, the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, and their EU equivalents for goods heading into the EU.This would, the document says, let a post-Brexit UK set its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world without causing border disruption. The statement says the new arrangements would prevent a hard Irish border, ensuring the “backstop” elements of the initial withdrawal agreement would not be needed.The statement ends by saying the plans, along with details to be set out in next week’s planned white paper, represent “a precise and responsible approach to the final stage of the negotiations”, giving frictionless trade in goods along with regulatory flexibility for services.The plan, it adds, would still give the UK an independent trade policy, with the ability to set its own non-EU tariffs and to reach separate trade deals. It also promises to end the role of the ECJ in UK affairs.Such a deal would end the automatic free movement of people into the UK from the EU but include a “mobility framework” allowing easy movement for work or study.Beyond whatever objections and modifications the EU might present, the statement is broad enough to be open to significant interpretation by ministers of various Brexit hues, not to mention backbench Conservative MPs.While the plan states it has not breached any of May’s stated red lines, it is a distinctly soft variant of the proposed Brexits on offer and, even if it is not amended or ditched, outside pressure could place different interpretations on the terms stated. This is version one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd81c7eba82940f6d433a06cc3c3715de820e9c8/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35363d8398b17be933873ffc2382ba07","title":"brexit summit how the papers saw theresa mays deal","story":"While most saw outcome as a victory for PM, Daily Mail warns of re-election riskThere are just two subjects that the papers are interested in today: the World Cup game between England and Sweden and Theresa May winning support for her Brexit deal at the Chequers summit on Friday.Most of the newspapers agree that the Brexit agreement is a victory for May. splashes with the headline: “May wins cabinet agreement for soft Brexit plan” and reports that the prime minister managed to sign up “her fractious cabinet” to a “controversial plan to match EU standards on food and goods”, but that this had not gone down well with Tory Brexiters.The headline on the strongly pro-Brexit Daily  is: “Cabinet signs up to May’s Brexit deal” and they report: “Theresa May won her battle with Eurosceptic ministers on Friday night as she announced the cabinet has signed up to a Brexit deal that keeps Britain tied to EU rules and regulations indefinitely.”The headline on the FT Weekend is “May wins backing for ‘soft’ Brexit after facing down cabinet rebels” and the i weekend is even more stark with “May takes back control”.The Daily Mail is less than impressed with the deal that has been reached, calling it “an uneasy agreement on a 12-point ‘compromise’, which could see Britain tied to some EU rules forever”. Their front page has the headline, “Soft Brexit threat to May”, and they warn the Conservatives may lose the next election if the Brexit deal “goes too far”.The Times is interested in how the deal will affect Boris Johnson, who led a group of Tory rebels who were calling for a tougher line on Brexit, and whom they claim will be sacked “if he rebels again”.

Then aged 23 with a three-year-old son, she had been forced to leave her two-up two-down house on the other side of the town centre when it was condemned as unsafe.Doherty is now 72 and she’s still there. “It was heaven coming here,” she says, sitting in her sunny front room. “It felt brilliant because we didn’t have a bath in the old house or an inside toilet. Everything here was perfectly decorated. It was so lovely.”There are housing estates like the one Doherty has called home for nearly half a century all over the country: the same pebble-dashed walls, paved paths and neat lawns. But somehow, over the years, Lower Falinge has come to represent something much more complicated.While locals insisted the figures were warped by the exclusion of parts of the estate with a higher number of owner-occupiers, and by the high level of hostel accommodation nearby, other media organisations jumped on the story. The following day the  published an article with the headline: “Rush-hour silence in a welfare ghetto”.From then on, as the area continued to top lists measuring levels of deprivation, the estate became a symbol of poverty, poor-quality housing and inequality. Photos started to crop up in all kinds of contexts, often in stories with no connection to Lower Falinge at all. In 2014, an article in the Independent with the headline: “England’s poorest will live nine years less than the richest, according to stark new ONS stats”, was illustrated with a picture of the estate. A 2015 New Statesman piece on myths about inequality was too. In 2016, the national media descended on Lower Falinge again, when David Cameron announced that “sink estates” could be demolished to make way for new homes. Although he did not mention it by name, journalists and photographers looking for an example of a “sink estate” outside of London once again arrived in droves, further establishing its status as a stock image of poverty.“Millions of ‘just managing’ families are on the edge of poverty – report warns”, reads a 2017 headline in the Express, accompanied by an image taken on an overcast day. The same image appears alongside the Sky News headline from the same year “‘Divisive’ white working-class label is ‘all talk’”. A list of landlord Tory MPs who voted against making properties “fit for human habitation” in the International Business Times and a piece in Prospect magazine about the benefits cap were similarly illustrated. Many  stories have featured images of Lower Falinge, too, including a recent story about the lack of funding for social housing in the north of England. But for many residents, these depictions do not fit with the image they have of where they live. “Every estate has its problems, no matter where you go, but they always seem to pick on us,” says Doherty. “We’re just normal people, wanting to get on with each other.”Andy Littlewood was chair of the Lower Falinge tenants and residents association when the media frenzy hit in 2016. “We’ve had to put in a lot of work to undo the harm that the press has done to us,” he says.The effect of the estate’s reputation on residents is wide-ranging, he says. Many will not tell potential employers where they live for fear it will put them off. “They just say they live in Rochdale because they’ve been turned down from jobs that they thought they had a good chance of getting when they’ve written Lower Falinge as their address.” Littlewood says the impact on younger people growing up on the estate is particularly potent. “The kids are fed up of being told they’re nothing,” he says. “If you tell a vulnerable person enough times that they’re scum, that they live on a sink estate and that they’re thick, eventually it’ll mess with their heads and they’ll start to believe it.”Littlewood does not dispute that many people on the estate are out of work – he is unable to work because of epilepsy – but is studying part-time for a degree in maths and computing from the Open University. The amount of employment and support allowance paid out per person on the estate is three times the average for the borough of Rochdale as a whole. And although Littlewood admits “it’s not perfect”, he says he loves Lower Falinge.Andrew Johnson, who lives in neighbouring College Bank – a group of tower blocks that can often be seen in the background of pictures of Lower Falinge – agrees. “It’s really handy,” he says. “I’m literally a two-minute walk from the town centre with supermarkets on my doorstep. It isn’t chaos, hopelessness and despair.”Marie Kelly, 37, is one of a small group of residents who spend their spare time tending to the estate’s community garden. On an implausibly hot day, she proudly gives a tour of the flower beds, which have produced, among other things, strawberries, purple sprouting broccoli, lettuce, carrots, beans, onions and potatoes. Kelly sees working on the garden as a kind of therapy. “I suffer with some mental health issues and it gives me something to focus on,” she says. For Clare Tostevin, the director of growth at Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) – a tenant and employee co-owned mutual housing society that runs the estate – there is a wider problem with the way tenants of social housing are presented.“We need to think about how we change that narrative, because areas of social housing are full of people getting on with their lives just like all of us,” she says. “There’s this idea that if you’re in social housing you’re desperate, you’re needy, it’s your last resort, and that’s just not the case.”Although Tostevin is highly critical of the language used in Cameron’s sink estate announcement, the initiative provided RBH with £560,000 of funding to draw up regeneration plans for the estate. The proposals include the refurbishment of 10 blocks on Lower Falinge and the replacement of 15. Four in seven of the neighbouring College Bank tower blocks are in line for demolition, with new townhouses planned to replace them. Many residents are hostile to the move – upset they will lose their homes – a fact Tostevin says demonstrates that the estate is loved by those who live there.A new set of photographs have been taken now, this time on a sunny day, and they tell a different story. And even if the change is a wrench, it is welcomed by some. Doherty’s block is one of those earmarked for demolition. Although she will miss her home hugely, she is looking forward to moving into a more accessible ground-floor flat. “The estate has changed a lot over the years,” she says. “When we were young we would never throw rubbish on the floor or do anything like that, but there are still loads of lovely people here. “I’m not ashamed to say I come from here. I’ve never been ashamed to say I come from Lower Falinge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c86df3119d3741a0bdba5817a9e9b59cc207f7df/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75382a2e68f61243ecf2b789eb3016b","title":"lewis hamilton ride wave chase records british grand prix","story":"If the four-times world champion wins for the sixth time at Silverstone on Sunday he would set new marks for total and consecutive victories in his home raceHe may now be considered one of the elder statesmen of Formula One but for Lewis Hamilton some moments retain their magic even 12 years into a remarkably successful career.The British Grand Prix is one of them and the driver who wears his heart on his sleeve returns to Silverstone once more revelling in being able to perform in front of his home crowd.They share his passion, his emotion and his commitment, as do his Mercedes team, who value these traits for all that it can mean he is a handful to manage. They believe Hamilton has another five years at the top of F1 in him and want him to see them out at Mercedes.Since he made his debut at the track in 2007 Hamilton has made his love of Silverstone clear and this year the four-times world champion has the chance to secure his place in the annals of a grand prix that has been on the F1 calendar since the championship began in 1950. He won for the first time at Silverstone in 2008, a magnificent performance in the wet for McLaren and has taken the flag for the past four years with Mercedes. A fifth consecutive victory would beat Jim Clark’s run of four and his sixth win would surpass Clark and Alain Prost’s record of five.He was 22 when he first took to the windswept former airfield and promptly made his mark with pole position. Since that exceptional rookie season, he has never looked back but the British Grand Prix will always be special.“It’s been a really incredible journey since 2007,” he said. “Just to be riding this positive wave every time you come to this grand prix. I’m really grateful to be in the position to fight for a win at Silverstone for the sixth time. Not many drivers get to do that. So I’m very privileged in that respect.”It has been some journey. He has 65 wins, second only to Michael Schumacher, but it has not always been smooth. Hamilton is demanding on himself, and others. Even at the previous race in Austria his frustration with the team over a poor strategy call was obvious to all. But Mercedes would have it no other way.The team principal, Toto Wolff, was clear this was the price you pay for such a rare talent. “You need a lion in the car that is giving it everything. The best ones are also sensitive,” he said. “Exceptional iniduals you just have to accept they have strong opinions, views and a strong drive. That determination to win and that ambition in a situation is not an easy character trait to deal with. But it is just what we want in the team. The super nice, polite guy is not what we want. We want the guy that scores the tries and wins the trophies, so I embrace high maintenance.”The team are in the process of re-signing their contract with the 33-year-old, for what is expected to be a two-year deal. Hamilton has made it clear he wants to pursue other interests when he retires, music and fashion among them, but Wolff believes he still has more to come in F1.“I think he has another five very good years in him,” said Wolff, who wants them to be with Mercedes. “If in two years’ time we still feel the same about each other, have trust, I think it would be clear that we continue.” Hamilton is in a tight fight for the title with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who leads the championship by one point. The pair have three wins apiece, their cars are evenly matched and the advantage has swapped between them with an ebb and flow that has made predicting the outcome impossible. The lead has changed hands five times in nine races.The season will likely be decided by tiny margins and the relationship between team and driver is going to be vital. Wolff describes Hamilton as a “creative” talent and explains his role is to ensure he nurtures the best from his driver. He also stresses that one of Hamilton’s key strengths is that he is brutally honest with himself. A trait he has displayed since he was racing for Frédéric Vasseur’s ART team in GP2 in 2006.“Frédéric Vasseur told me that when Lewis was in GP2 he was the only young driver that when he got out of the car said: ‘You don’t need to look at the data as my driving was not good’. He still does the same today,” Wolff said.Mercedes have won the last four drivers’ and constructors’ championships but Wolff describes the fight with Ferrari as “the biggest challenge we have had so far”. Hamilton is at the sharp end of that task and it is one that will likely go to the wire but at this particular moment at Silverstone he is just enjoying sharing his passion with the fans he loves.“As the years go on, you appreciate the support more and more,” he said. “2007 was already pretty cool and then 2008, I really will never forget that day. I hope I can wave the flag for a little bit longer.”His weekend opened with the positive start he would have wanted. Hamilton topped the time sheets in first practice in front of his teammate Valtteri Bottas, with Vettel in third, half a second back.In the afternoon session, Vettel was on top with Hamilton second just 0.187sec behind and Bottas third. Mercedes had expected to be strong and the thinner tread on the tyres being used this weekend certainly suits their cars.Hamilton dominated and won at the last two races at which they were used in Spain and France. On this form, a sixth pole at his home grand prix on Sunday looks well within his grasp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10c80969fda9bc389b5a80ccdf972224c5e9348d/0_22_5298_3179/master/5298.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfbc7d7159217e0290fd08fa0eb5ff7c","title":"ufc 223 preview max holloway concussion","story":"It’s troubling when a fighter shows concussion-like symptoms, but particularly in the days before a bout rather than after itMax Holloway didn’t appear to be his usual cheery self during his appearance on the Fox Sports television program UFC Tonight on Wednesday. So Bisping, the former UFC middleweight champion, decided to press the issue.“Max, you say you feel great, don’t be offended when I say this, but you look like you just got out of bed,” Bisping noted. “Are you tired? What’s going on? How’s the weight cut? Are you drained? You look a little sleepy.”Holloway, 26, had already been forced to withdraw from a lightweight title fight with Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 223 in April after experiencing difficulty during his weight cut.If Holloway (19-3) was encountering similar trouble ahead of Saturday’s scheduled featherweight title defense against Brian Ortega at UFC 226 in Las Vegas, it’s a mere formality at this point. It turns out Bisping was onto something with his queries: Holloway wasn’t right. He withdrew from the fight on Wednesday citing lingering concussion symptoms, meaning he was, in effect, concussed when he was being interviewed.“Max’s team and UFC staff noticed Max was not normal since late last week,” Holloway’s manager, Brian Butler, said in a statement. “This became obvious to many watching his interviews and public appearances the past few days. He was showing concussion-like symptoms before he even started his weight cut and was rushed to the ER on Monday where they admitted him over night.“Initial scans seemed OK, and he was released Tuesday afternoon but symptoms still continued. Max fought with his team to continue with the fight. He showed some improvement over the next day but was still showing obvious symptoms. After open workouts, he crashed and was very hard to wake up, when he did he had flashing vision and slurred speech. He is now back in the ER for further tests.”Where Holloway goes from here is unclear. It’s alarming when any athlete experiences concussion-like symptoms, but particularly when it’s a fighter who is feeling the effects of his sport’s punishing nature days before a bout rather than after.Maybe Holloway’s isn’t a rare case but rather something that happens quite often with the warning signs ignored. Maybe it’s simply an indicator of progress that the public is even aware of Holloway’s plight. Retired two-ision champion boxer Timothy Bradley experienced a myriad of neurological issues in the aftermath of his 2013 fight of the year with Ruslan Provodnikov, and he was frank in discussing how he dealt with lingering symptoms.Bradley admitted that he was dizzy months later while preparing for a bout with Juan Manuel Marquez, and that his “speech was a little bit off.”The toll required to become – and remain – a top-level fighter reaches far beyond the physical punishment the athletes sustain on fight night.Sparring is often brutal, with recent studies showing that headgear does little to stave off the effects of blows to the head.And as Bradley illustrated, you never stop paying for some particularly grueling fights, even if the fighters appear fine to the naked eye.In this case, Holloway didn’t appear fine to the trained eye of Bisping, and fortunately, he was pulled off the card before he sustained possibly life-threatening damage.It’s a refreshing approach to Holloway’s health and safety in a blood sport where far too often the first call is to satisfy the machismo fans and media demand from the fighters.Retire on your stool after receiving too many blows? You’re branded a quitter. Having an off-night and simply losing, though not in any brutal fashion? Don’t give in, or your reputation will be shot to tatters.But in a day and age in when NFL players are retiring before they even reach the age of 25 citing health reasons, and awareness of the damages of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) is ever-growing, just maybe, Holloway’s removal from UFC 226 is a sign of progress, and not based around an outlier who simply has something very wrong with him.After all, these guys are routinely absorbing elbows, knees, punches and kicks to the cranium from well-trained athletes, and surely, Holloway isn’t the only combat sports athletes who has experienced such symptoms in the lead-up to a major fight.“The differential diagnosis could include … possible metabolic, toxic, inflammatory or even infectious causes if there had been no evidence of concussive or subconcussive blows,” Dr Margaret Goodman told the . She’s a Las Vegas-based neurologist who has examined thousands of fighters and is the former chief physician for the Nevada State Athletic Commission.Goodman also is the co-founder of the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association, the agency which oversees drug testing protocol for many of the biggest boxing matches, and she was the chair of the commission’s medical advisory board.She believes Holloway will undergo “extensive blood tests in addition to perhaps a Pet scan (positron emission tomography) depending on changes to his condition. Even if his condition resolves, it’s crucial to still determine the possible etiologies in order to protect him from recurrences or worsening – especially if related to prior concussions which can be additive.”So Holloway won’t compete Saturday, and his absence from the event’s co-main leaves the UFC with another gaping hole on a major card.As Thursday’s news conference wrapped up, light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier slipped off the stage and crashed onto a speaker before he limped away, and White surely couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Cormier is set to challenge heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic at UFC 226, and White could ill afford to lose one half of his main event, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507d9b605c83fa760df519000cdde0c3226d9233/0_177_4334_2600/master/4334.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0e854e54f02be23f43f34dd7e43c072","title":"england v new zealand womens first odi live","story":"8th over: England 35-0 (Jones 23, Beaumont 6) Jones nails a straight drive, which goes straight to mid-off but the batters ignore the age-old village rule of not running on a misfield, rewarded for their maverick, two-fingers to authority attitude with a single. Two more singles, one from a lovely flowing flick over square leg by Jones, ends another decent over from Huddleston.7th over: England 32-0 (Jones 21, Beaumont 5) New bowler, Sophie Devine, rumbles in with some Merv Hughes-esque sunblock on her face. A wide, but then a jaffa, moving away from Jones as she drives thin air. And then another, which Jones sort of tries to pull out of without fooling anyone. Cracking over. 6th over: England 31-0 (Jones 21, Beaumont 5) Lovely flick off her toes from Jones, getting through the fielders but she didn’t all of it, getting two for a shot which, aesthetically at least, deserved more. Then she really does get all of a pull, from a ball that wasn’t that short, but nonetheless disappeared to the mid-wicket fence.5th over: England 25-0 (Jones 15, Beaumont 5) More short stuff from Tahuhu - there’s so much of it that there must be a plan of some description here, but I’m stuffed if I can work it out. Beaumont hits at two of them, middles neither but gets two from the second. 4th over: England 21-0 (Jones 14, Beaumont 3) Huddleston is as consistent as Tahuhu has been erratic. Jones walks across the crease to try and get something away, but the line is too tight. She then oversteps and Jones puts the free hit vertical, which is caught but not out - a statement which is less existentially deep than it might appear. 3rd over: England 18-0 (Jones 13, Beaumont 2) More good mixed with dreck, like Tahuhu is making a whiskey and cold sick cocktail. Some tight deliveries are followed by a short one outside off then a similar length straighter ball, both of which are swatted to the ropes by Jones. Then she gets a bicep-high full-toss, flapping it for a single but obviously a no-ball punished by a free hit...which is a wide. But she finally sends down a decent ball and Beaumont can only flick to a sort of leg gully. And an ‘all over the shop’ over is completed by a curtailed lbw shout. Eventful. 2nd over: England 7-0 (Jones 4, Beaumont 2) Holly Huddleston has the ball from the other end, and sends down an over full of excellent areas. Beaumont drives and misses at a yorker length ball outside off, then picks up two from the last ball with a flick out to deep mid-wicket. 1st over: England 5-0 (Jones 4, Beaumont 0) Lea Tahuhu has the ball, but starts with a legside wide, following up with the classic overcompensation and Amy Jones cuts a long-hop just in front of point for four. The rest of the over is better, with her slightly slingy action, featuring a perfect line and length ball that moved the requisite half-bat width to beat the outside edge. The England openers and the New Zealand fielders are out on the Headingley turf and sport - Sport! Sport! Sport! - is imminent. Incidentally, Anya Shrubsole is out with a side strain, while Dani Wyatt is absent for personal reasons. The former might mean that Katie George, on dayboo, might open the bowling when it comes to England’s turn later. Kerr, of course, is just a few weeks removed from that extraordinary 232* against Ireland, off just 145 balls, obviously the highest ever inidual score in a women’s ODI. ...and they will bat. What to make of England’s performance in the ICC Women’s Championship, this sprawling tournament played over 18-odd months to keep the worlds ODI teams ticking over, but also determine qualification for the 2021 World Cup? Three wins, three defeats, currently fourth place in the table with a neutral record. Two of those defeats were in the Ashes, the other in the 2-1 series win over South Africa this summer. If you were being critical you’d call it a mild hangover from last year’s triumph, but the more optimistic (and we’re being optimistic about English sport for the moment, right?) might class it more as England finding their form at a good time.Certainly the recent T20 tri-series would suggest so, the appallingly young Sophie Ecclestone coming to the fore and the big guns, Katherine Brunt and Anya Shrubsole, looking closer to their best. And then there’s Tammy Beaumont, a veritable run machine in the last two years, and of course the implausible Sarah Taylor, who will today become the most-capped wicketkeeper in ODI history, assuming she plays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2057ebaf6b28e4c535dfc7158fe1ffc2fac17a5/190_313_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e445b72e2e5845c8472eecb0f786239","title":"meet the makers behind some of londons top market stalls","story":"From pork loins to concrete planters – traders at the capital’s fourth Urban Village Fete in Greenwich share their passions and productsThe Greenwich peninsula is undergoing a transformation from concrete jungle to a buzzing design and creative space. To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ac9c72b6f6f47b7ddc23f05d4f40b47907d5b9e/256_63_1576_946/master/1576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c4009d6c05b7c79d6a61dabebb3613","title":"james martin american adventure fiona sturges","story":"‘His final dish is barbecued rib-eye steak and corn on the cob, fully basted in sweat and despair’“Howdy guys and girls, welcome to Texas,” says the TV chef James Martin, entirely without conviction, from behind the wheel of a massive pick-up truck. It’s the third week of James Martin’s American Adventure (Friday, 8pm, ITV), which sees our host engaged in an uphill battle to convince viewers he’s enjoying himself. So far, there have been sunbaked sojourns around Napa Valley and Santa Monica, bringing with them alfresco cookery, flash wheels, too-tight trousers and a nasty case of sunburn. Next stop is San Antonio, Texas, where, says our hatchet-faced host, “the bustling Mexican vibe brings the place alive”. Martin, though, is dead inside. While the background music is pure mariachi fiesta, his expression screams: “Someone call my agent. When will this nightmare be over?”We shouldn’t be surprised. There’s nothing that’s not awkward about Martin. He spent 10 years intermittently setting fire to stuff on Saturday Kitchen – which, in retrospect, looks less like a series of culinary cock-ups than a cry for help. Had he lifted a saucepan lid one day to reveal his producer’s head bubbling away with a bouquet garni, few would have been surprised.But, having recently hightailed it to ITV, Martin has now landed what many would see as the ultimate prize – a cooking show-cum-travelogue that allows him to eat his way across entire countries and hobnob with some of the best chefs in the world. It’s a typical reward for long-serving TV chefs and foodies as they slide inexorably towards midlife crisis (see also The Hairy Bikers’ Mediterranean Adventure, Jamie’s Great Escape, and every Rick Stein show ever made). But away from the demands of live television, and thousands of miles from home, Martin is struggling to work up an appetite.“We’re not built for extreme heat in Yorkshire,” he says plaintively from behind his workstation in San Antonio’s Market Square, damp patches spreading across his shirt. It’s hotter than Satan’s bum crack here, though producers have nonetheless seen fit to park him in front of a giant\u0026nbspbarbecue in order to work his magic on a slab of salmon. Rather than being offered something useful like an electric fan, he’s given a fresh shirt and a miniature bottle of tequila and left to sweat it out in front of the nation.Elsewhere, along with a cursory two-minute history of the city, we get shots of Martin driving down a highway in his pick-up, Martin rocking a sombrero, and Martin, by now resembling a belligerent radish, scouring San Antonio for some\u0026nbspair-con. For penetrating insight into Tex-Mex culture, this is up there with Looney Tunes’ Speedy Gonzalez. His final dish, once again cooked out in the square, is barbecued rib-eye steak and corn on the cob. Fully basted in sweat and despair, Martin can barely string a sentence together. After accidentally setting fire to the corn husks and splattering his already soaked shirt in fat, he whacks the steak on a plate, glowers at the camera, turns on his heels and walks away. Martin may know about food, but lighting up the\u0026nbspscreen with his wit and charisma apparently isn’t in his job description. Someone get the man a beer and a ticket home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298c567711beca95b679ffdade52e49a9034f545/0_153_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c067ae7991e407c71753d8bf4878fc16","title":"tell queer eye guys everything","story":"I believe these men can fix me, and that is not something I’ve thought about anyone from reality TV, everArticles about the joyousness of Netflix’s reboot, in which five gay men with different specialisms give a life and style makeover to someone in dire need, are so numerous they have become a journalistic genre unto themselves. When the first series came out earlier this year, I myself made lofty claims about how the show is “what our era needs”. I probably even suggested it was the anti-Trump show, knowing me. But as I sit in my darkened room, curtains closed against the sun, bent over my iPad, waiting for another hit – just one! – of Tan convincing some pot-bellied American dad to swap his baggy sweatshirt for a fitted polo in a colour “that pops”, I’ve had to accept that my obsession has nothing to do with the world and everything to do with me.The normal stream of consciousness that forms the muzak in my head (“Don’t forget the dry-cleaning oh God let there be a seat on the bus should I know more about North Korea mmm quite fancy some cheese”) has been entirely replaced with imaginary conversations with the men from Queer Eye. On some deeply buried, unexpected and extremely needy level, I believe these men can fix me, and that is not something I’ve thought about anyone from reality TV, ever. And this is because the men from Queer Eye seem (unusually) genuinely talented, and come across (uniquely for reality TV) as funny and wise and lovely. (The obvious exception to this is Antoni, the nominal chef of the show, who is lovely to look at but I strongly suspect doesn’t even know how to turn on a stove.) This is what we talk about:Tan (fashion)Tan is the easiest-going eye, which is why I suspect he is the most liked within the group. (Go on, ask me who on the show is really friends with who. I have opinions!) I talk to Tan about how sometimes I buy clothes not because I like them, but because I think they’re the sort of thing people expect me to wear, even though I know everyone is too busy thinking about their own lives to worry about my dresses. So do I think my defining feature is my wardrobe because I lack confidence in the actual me? Tan and I talk about this a lot on the bus.Bobby (interior design)I am currently doing up my living room, so Bobby and I have been in constant contact this summer. He reminds me that a room has to be practical and can’t just be about fun wallpaper, and that there is a fine line between a room that says, “This woman makes bold, stylish statements!” and “This woman probably keeps dried pampas grass in a giant Chinese urn.” I tell Bobby that, even though he is the least charismatic cast member, I know he works the hardest, and while all Karamo has to do is give pep talks in a car, Bobby has to carry literal roofs on his literal back. He looks down, touched, and tells me he appreciates that.Jonathan (grooming)Jonathan and I talk a lot about politics. I tell him how righteous it was when he shot Antoni down in a recent interview, after Antoni suggested it might be helpful for them to give a makeover to an all-out homophobe. Jonathan replied, in essence, “This is 2018, Antoni, and we don’t have time for your kumbaya politics, so stop breaking your back to accommodate haters, and fight for your truth instead.” As Jonathan would say, Yasss queen.But I also talk to Jonathan about my hair. I tell him that most of it fell out as a teenager, due to anorexia, and never grew back properly, and while most online comments don’t bother me, when people snark about my hair I have – piling shame upon shame – cried. Jonathan tells me I’m fabulous and those people are the literal worst, and he is right.Karamo (culture, whatever that means)I think of Karamo as a constant, messianic, ridiculously handsome presence in my life, who gazes upon the choices I make and occasionally calls me out on them. A little like God, yes, but I think of him more like the Patrick Swayze to my Whoopi Goldberg. He’s proud of me when I go to yoga. He benignly rolls his eyes when I drunkenly eat an entire birthday cake in front of an episode of Frasier I’ve seen four times at 2am.Antoni (food)I never talk to Antoni.

He has said the North Korean leader said he would destroy a missile engine testing site and then organise the repatriation of remains of US soldiers killed in the Korean war. Pompeo is also asking for more substantial steps towards disarmament, reportedly including an inventory of the North Korean arsenal of warheads and missiles.Early on Saturday morning, Pompeo left the Pyongyang guesthouse where the US delegation is staying to make a call through secure communications to Trump at his New Jersey golf club. The national security advisor, John Bolton, and the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, also took part in the call. Pompeo briefed them on his initial round of talks on Friday with Kim Yong-chol, a former spy chief and vice chair of the ruling party. As well as a working session on Friday, the two men had dinner, which the state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, described as “relationship building”. Nauert said that at times they were “cracking jokes” and “exchanging pleasantries.”She said that progress had been made in Friday’s discussions, adding that the talks had covered the process of denuclearisation and the repatriation of American remains. She added: “we expect them to live up to their commitments.” The two also established working groups to deal with what Nauert described as the “nitty gritty stuff” of outstanding issues between the two countries.She said Pompeo had been “very firm” in seeking three basic goals: complete denuclearization of North Korea, security assurances, and the repatriation of remains.When Pompeo returned to the guesthouse after phoning on Saturday, Kim asked Pompeo how he had slept, adding: “we did have very serious discussion on very important matters yesterday. So thinking about those discussions you might have not slept well last night.”“Director Kim I slept just fine,” Pompeo replied. He went on to point the importance of their task of implementing what Trump and Kim agreed in Singapore and set off on the “the path toward complete denuclearisation”.“Of course it is important,” Kim said, but added: “There are things that I have to clarify.”Pompeo replied: “There are things that I have to clarify as well.”The secretary of state is under time pressure to produce results by August, when the US and South Korea were due to hold joint military exercises. Those exercises were cancelled on Trump’s orders in Singapore as an up-front concession. Adding to the pressure, the president has repeatedly claimed that the testing site has already been destroyed, and that the soldiers’ remains have been sent back, neither of which has happened.Trump has also made extravagant claims about what was agreed in Singapore. At a rally in Montana on Thursday, he claimed: “We signed a wonderful paper saying they’re going to denuclearise their whole thing. It’s going to all happen.”In a joint statement with Trump, Kim agreed to move towards “complete denuclearisation” but that has been a stock phrase in North Korean rhetoric since 1992 and signifies a vague and long-term process of multilateral disarmament on the Korean peninsula. Since the Singapore meeting, satellite images and intelligence leaks have suggested that North Korea is upgrading critical parts of its nuclear programme. “Our leaders made commitments at the Singapore summit on the complete denuclearisation of North Korea and outlined what a transformed US-DPRK relationship could look like,” Pompeo said on his way to Pyongyang.Even while Pompeo has been in Pyongyang, new satellite pictures were published by the website 38 North, showing work had been completed on the cooling plant for a new nuclear reactor.  Unnamed US intelligence officials also concluded that North Korea does not intend to completely give up its nuclear stockpile.In Pyongyang on Friday, Pompeo met Kim Yong-chol, North Korea’s former spy chief and vice-chair of the ruling party, in an extensive guest house in Pyongyang, close to a vast mausoleum where North Korea’s former leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, are buried.Welcoming Pompeo and the US team to the first session of talks, Kim Yong-chol, said: “The more you come, more trust we can build between one another.”“Today’s meeting is a really meaningful meeting,” the 73-year-old general said.Pompeo replied: “Yes, I agree I look forward to it and I count on it being very productive.”Noting it was his third visit to Pyongyang, he joked: “If I come one more time, I will have to pay taxes here.”Earlier, Pompeo laughed but did not reply to a question about a South Korean report that he had brought a CD of Elton John’s Rocket Man, as a gift for Kim Jong-un. “Rocket Man” was the nickname Trump gave to Kim when tensions between the two countries reached a peak last year. The meeting lasted two hours and 45 minutes and Pompeo then had dinner with his senior aides. The next session is due to start at 9am. It is unclear whether Pompeo will meet Kim Jong-un on this trip. There were reports before Pompeo began his visit, that he might relax the US demand for complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament (CVID), and settle for mutual confidence-building measures that defused tensions without dismantling the North Korean arsenal.His spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, denied those reports on Thursday, saying: “Nothing could be further from the truth. Our policy toward North Korea has not changed. “We are committed to a denuclearised North Korea and Secretary Pompeo looks forward to continuing his consultations with North Korean leaders to follow up on the commitments made at the Singapore summit,” Nauert added. However, she did explain why Pompeo and other US officials had stopped using the CVID formulation in their remarks. Pompeo will also use his trip to consult and reassure Washington’s allies in the region, with meetings planned with Japanese and South Korean officials in Tokyo on Sunday. Japan has voiced support for the leaders’ Singapore declaration, but reacted cautiously to Trump’s decision to cancel joint military exercises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a0e3cdce1e3360ae7f193ab8289c9040fadc1e9/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e517909b4e94b840917bcba6912119fb","title":"african american unemployment kansas city","story":"As Trump highlights declining jobless figures, Kansas City offers a window into how the recovery has passed many African Americans byKansas City is booming. Employers and investors have poured into the midwestern city since the recession. At least $1bn has gone into its sparkling new downtown, revitalized arts district and shiny new condos. So why is Sly James, its highly regarded outgoing mayor, so unhappy?James, who steps down in July 2019, is leaving office with a sense of disappointment that despite Kansas City’s obvious accomplishments, the city’s recovery has left one large section of society behind: African Americans.But national numbers in a country as big as the US can be misleading. For many African Americans in the Kansas City area, the spoils of a roaring recovery have passed them by.As with the rest of the United States’ recovery from the 2008 recession, Kansas City’s comeback still carries the scars of the structural and intentional racism of its not-so-distant past.Carl, who did not want his last name published, is 57 years old and has big dreams: “I want to save up, put something aside for a proper burial, pay off my house, keep up with my car payments and pay that off. Typical American dream stuff,” he says. But his access to the American dream had to be deferred.Carl has been unemployed for nearly a year, collecting social security insurance after a hip replacement following an incident on his full-time construction job. Carl may be unemployed but he still works hard. The white blotches of his graying hair nearly match the white of his tightly starched button-down shirt and well-shined, tuxedo shoes. Most telling are the smoothed calluses on his fingertips one of his many jobs is playing the bass guitar for his local church.“One Sunday an announcement was made at the church about job workshops,” he says. He hustled, calling the numbers listed on the pamphlets left on the back of church tables. “After doing that program, I heard about the financial opportunity centers.”These financial opportunity centers (FOCs) are a pillar program of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), where, according to Trese Booze, who heads these FOCs in Kansas City, coaches help “overlooked talent to prepare them for quality, living-wage jobs, while becoming resilient to financial shock”.Maurice Jones, LISC’s national CEO, says the goal was for participants to become “net cash positive”, culminating in a life plan that is “inspiring to them”. People just like Carl make their way into FOCs at a variety of points on their employment trajectory. For Carl, a felony conviction has made getting a job trickier than usual. He says he was pressured into a plea deal after brandishing an unregistered firearm in self-defense, in response to being threatened several times by gang members in his apartment complex.Like many with criminal records around the country, Carl must jump the hurdles of the “collateral consequences of convictions” if he is to get a job. According to the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Convictions (NICCC) compiled by the Council of State Governments, Carl could face up to 185 legally sanctioned barriers in Kansas to different kinds of employment and job certifications because of his conviction. In Missouri, that number increases to 313 – and that is before any consideration of the intangible effects of perception of being a black man with a felony conviction. Carl’s criminal record and the hip replacement that lost him both his “side-hustle” as a home-health provider and his full-time construction gig haven’t stopped his penchant for hustling.If you’re in Kansas City, he might be your beautician or barber. He might be your bass guitarist in a wedding or church band. And in Carl’s words: “I’ve dug ditches and I’d do it again to keep up with the payments if it wasn’t for my injury.”Shellie, an unemployed, 46-year-old mother, says that for her, bad things come in pairs.“First my car that I used to get to work was stolen,” she says, as her hair hides her tears. She recounts that days later, her “apartment building was shut down because the landlord had so many code violations”. The landlord, whose activities she says were tantamount to being a slumlord, never updated his tenants and gave them only 24 hours to move out.While the loss of the car might not be a stumbling block for some in major metropolitan areas, residents can’t expect much help from Kansas City’s Area Transportation Authority. KCATA’s director of business development, Frank White, says the jobs with livable wages aren’t easily accessible because “transit hasn’t been at the table when economic development conversations happen”. wIf the group that transports “the poor people” isn’t at the table when major decisions are made, those “poor people” won’t be guaranteed a voice.Walled off by Troost Avenue, black people were historically restricted to the east side of the city by carefully constructed covenants that prevented them from moving into Kansas City’s Country Club District. The homes of a burgeoning African American community were demolished to make room for Highway 71 over the course of decades, further impeding travel from black neighborhoods to the rest of the city. The predominantly white Country Club district remains one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the United States, abutting one of the poorest areas of Kansas City.None of this, as James notes, took place “strictly by happenstance”.The net result is that jobs deemed geographically close to black communities are are actually far if traveling by public transit. Shellie, who lives in the urban core, is about an 18-20 minute drive from Lenexa, Kansas, host of a new Amazon fulfillment center. Without a car, the the 18-20 minute drive becomes two hours and 12 minutes of bus-riding and walking, often without sidewalks.Shellie, like Carl, finds odd jobs and public benefit programs that she can use to feed her child, and she leverages programs like LISC’s financial opportunity center to get her “financial house in order”. “Everybody falls and hopefully everybody gets back,” she says. “But when a person falls, you need a little cushion so you can get yourself back up. But nowadays with a president that wants to cut the programs that help me get up, I live in fear every day that I can’t get up anymore.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735b6baab21ebebb46514e92cb299d2f6e4348d0/0_37_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88944b2729ea80508fafac144ce4cb7d","title":"easy does it the slow travel guide to the peloponnese greece","story":"The majestic peninsula is home to local tavernas, picturesque villages, ancient sites and stunning stretches of coast. Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch. Elia does superb salads, aromatic grilled sardines, and octopus with capers.StayZoe Resort’s 20 attractive studios and apartments have a large swimming pool and gardens leading down to the beach. Or you could opt to stay in the older – but no less charming – 24-room Zoe hotel.This historic town is known for the imposing walls of its Venetian fortress, which stretch out towards the sea. It’s very sleepy spot, with a wide sandy beach shelving very gently into shallow waters.Eat and drinkThe Klimataria restaurant is very well regarded, and eating out in the garden courtyard is a reason to visit in itself. Chicken in mustard sauce is delicious, as are the grilled veggies.StayThe Ulysses hotel, a small and friendly lodging with just nine rooms, is great for the beach. Breakfast is excellent and the hotel makes its own fresh lemonade – perfect for kicking off the morning. The Markopouloses, who own the Ulysses, are a mine of information and treat their guests as one of the family.The stunning, rugged hamlet of Gerolimenas, at the head of a fjord-like inlet, was once a busy trading post now it’s a nostalgic post-boom village, and comprises a mere handful of stone houses, a couple of tavernas and a beach.Eat and drinkThe fish – guaranteed fresh – is excellent here. Head for the harbour and you won’t go wrong.StayIf you want remote coupled with contemporary boutique-style comfort, a stay at the Kyrimai hotel should suit. Converted from a 19th-century warehouse, with sea to three sides, the hotel has a standout restaurant, and you can plunge directly from its jetty into the clearest of seas. Recommended for couples more than families, this is definitely one for romantic getaways.Find last-minute summer holiday deals at sunviloffers.

By the time it ended, the three-month heatwave had caused the worst drought in 150 years, while the temperature recorded in Boora on July 29th marked the fifth day in a row when the mercury had breached 32 degrees.The summer drought was heightened by the lack of rainfall during the previous two winters, which placed extraordinary demands on supplies and led to restrictions being put in place a year later to rebuild stocks.Reporting on the heatwave, The  noted the changes in people’s habits that began to be noticed throughout June, as people grew more accustomed to the new Mediterranean climate. In Ireland, on June 29th, people mulled buying shutters for windows to let the air in, and keep the sun out as temperatures hit 27.5 degrees in the Midlands and 26 degrees at Armagh Observatory – the warmest June day there since 1870. Despite the endless sunshine, RTÉ’s Colm Connolly reported the concerns on July 2nd of a consultant dermatologist about people who were taking photo-sensitising drugs to boost tanning speeds.Meanwhile, drought-sensitive beech trees suffered badly, and the growth of many of them in Ireland and the UK still showed after-effects three decades later, though ones in the UK suffered worst.Sales on electric fans continued to rise while some families opted to stay indoors completely and cool off in “tepid baths”, though the authorities urged people to keep levels below five inches.Meanwhile, The  pondered about the effects of the heatwave on men’s sexual interest, fearing that the high temperatures were causing “a love drought”. “It seems the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak when temperatures soar into the 80 and 90s,” the newspaper reported, before interviewing a clinical psychologist who explained that men still felt “sexually aroused but don’t feel inclined to initiate any activity”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Man (59) pronounced dead at scene despite efforts by paramedics to resuscitate himThe Food Safety Authority of Ireland also recalls pestos over salmonella concernsCar in which dead man was a passenger left the road at Gibbstown early on SaturdayIncident took place at junction of John Street and The Manor at early on SaturdayAs they close in on a World Cup final, English expats expect colourful \u0026lsquosupport\u0026rsquo from the nativesData brings together sales prices, rents, locations, social housing and private rented levelsNew interactive resource shows the city\u0026rsquos social and economic isions in stark detailGalway woman Lorraine Walsh says cancer testing saved her life but let her down deeplyPatient representatives in Government review of cancer screening call for actionGsoc process not as advanced by time of Sgt Michael Galvin\u0026rsquos death as previously thoughtCardinal Kevin Farrell says priests have no credibility when it comes to training people for marriageLaw enforcement and safety groups have set September 19th as \u0026ldquoEuropean day without a road deathAdam Marlowe convicted on DNA found at scene after robbery and assault of farmer (81)Dublin Bus mechanic tried to sell boat on Adverts.ie to cover fraudulent injury claim costsZones of 100m-150m intended to stop women being harassed while accessing servicesTD links provision to approval for Russian embassy to significantly expand its premisesMany locals want only a memorial, while families favour total forensic excavationCandidate says party only wants Catherine Noone and Richard Bruton on DBN ticketBirdWatch Ireland says extension of burning periods may negatively impact some speciesDelivery was \u0027prelude where similar flights to hard-to-reach locations are concerned\u0027"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3556695.1530914083!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why does michael d higgins want a second term","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins. The details of how he will declare his hand are still uncertain. Photograph: Cyril ByrneFor months, President Michael D Higgins has kept his closest friends uncertain. They believed he would seek a second term in Áras an Uachtaráin. They hoped he would do so. But they did not know when he would make it known.“I’ve been saying it to him for a long time, and he has just nodded sagely along without saying anything,” said an acquaintance of regular entreaties made to the President to run again.A firmer indication came a fortnight ago, however. “He just said very quietly to me: second week in July.” However, the details of how exactly he will declare his hand are still uncertain.It will be a busy week for the 77-year-old head of state. Initially it was planned to hold an event in the Áras itself, but that has given way to a likely declaration made away from the trappings of the office.He will have to fit it around the visit of newly-weds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle next Wednesday. But, according to numerous sources, President Higgins is keen to deal with the issue now.Even though people close to him were unsure, President Higgins has, it is now understood, long planned to declare his hand in mid-July, near the end of the Dáil’s political season.The announcement itself will not be a surprise. But his explanation of why he wants a second term – after saying during the 2011 campaign that he would serve only one – will be of interest, along with what he intends to do with it.It is stressed by those close to him that next week – if he adheres to his current plan – will not be a campaign launch, but rather a “bare bones” notification of his intentions.“The main thing about next week will be the announcement,” said one figure close to the President. Then again, as another remarked, when has Michael D Higgins ever declined to elaborate on a position or line of argument?An explanation of the President’s U-turn on his initial one-term promise is seen in simple terms. It is argued that, in 2011, when he was suffering from a knee injury, he was conscious of charges of being too old for the job.If he wins the next presidential election – with a contest now likely – Higgins will be 84 when he stands down in 2025. “He now feels he is in a position to make a substantial contribution,” said one source. “His health is better now.”Another in regular contact with Higgins said he would “probably just explain it by saying he wasn’t sure seven years ago how he would physically be, but he has never been more active”.“If the people want him, he’ll serve.”Yet another said there was nothing “Machiavellian” about the 2011 promise. Indeed, Mr Higgins is consistently told by members of the public that he should stand again.“He has strong views of what he wants to do,” it is added. The arguments the President will make for why he should have another term are emerging.He will seek to capitalise on his widely praised stewardship of the 1916 centenary commemorations by arguing for continuity in the Áras during the next phase, which will mark the War of Independence and the Civil War.The centenaries of the Soloheadbeg ambush and the sitting of the first Dáil take place in January, and Higgins believes his family history will help him steer the State through what could be a contentious period of reflection.The President’s father and his uncles fought in the IRA during the War of Independence. In the Civil War, his father, John, took the anti-Treaty side while his uncle Peter fought for the pro-Treaty side.John fell into poverty after being shunned by his employers after the Civil War, while Peter became an officer in the Army. Peter raised two of John’s children, including the President.This history, coupled with his handling of recent commemorations, represent perhaps the most powerful argument for a second term, say his supporters.Another theme is expected to include the future of work, such as the creep of zero-hour contracts and precarious working arrangements, as well as a decline in union participation and the wider effect that has on societal bonds. He has spoken recently about the future of Europe and how the European Union will develop for citizens – the “European Street”, in the Michael D vernacular – in the coming years, with migration as a backdrop.Alliance building with other nonexecutive heads of State, such as the Greek, Portuguese and Italian presidents, will be presented as arguments for multilateralism, as will the benefits of the United Nations sustainable development goals, agreed at a UN summit in New York in 2015 at which Higgins made a number of speeches.Other key themes for a second term have been trailed at his recent summer garden parties in the Áras, such as that held last week to “celebrate sustainable communities”.There, Higgins spoke of the decline of traditional rural communities and increasing “urban strain”. He touched on the loss of services – such as post offices and pubs – in rural Ireland and congestion and housing shortages in cities, as well as the increasing isolation of many in an era of when the “transactions of daily life” now take place on “social technology”.Taken together, Higgins is positioning his second term towards social issues and away from the emphasis on the political economy that marked the start of his first term. While outspoken, he acted, at times, as a pressure-release valve for the political establishment during the years of austerity, when he criticised the wider economic model of the EU without directly attacking government policy.“There was a general feeling it was Michael D being Michael D,” said one figure involved in the 2011-2016 Fine Gael-Labour coalition. “There was a voice saying certain things that people may want to say, but there is a constraint being in government. It was better to have that in the system than not.”Even when it was felt he might have strayed beyond the boundaries of his office, it was thought best not to object.“You’d just be playing into his hands,” said another, who argued Higgins, as a popular president, would have become a political martyr if a government introducing spending cuts and tax increases had chosen to take him on.But there were times when views from the Áras caused anger on Merrion Street.An example is when a “a tacit signal came from the Park” that gender recognition legislation would not be looked kindly upon – understood to be an implied message that it could be referred to the Council of State – if were passed through the Dáil and Seanad before the 2015 same-sex marriage referendum were held.Doing so would have presented difficulties for the legal status of marriages where one person was transitioning from one sex to another. A successful referendum result would remove such problems.“Some people felt he was just trying to help the government,” said a source. “Another school of thought was: ‘That’s f***ing outrageous. He is trying to influence whether we push on with legislation’.”Former taoiseach Enda Kenny knew Higgins of old, and knew how to handle him, although some of his statements upset others in Fine Gael. Leo Varadkar is said to value the wiser counsel of an experienced operator.But Higgins is unlikely to push the limits of the presidency any further in a second term, say his friends.“He is not going to create a constitutional crisis,” said one. “He is very conscious of that boundary.”The question of how he will campaign has not been settled. The only previous example of an incumbent contesting an election for a second term is an 83-year-old Éamon de Valera in 1966.Fine Gael’s Tom O’Higgins, who came within 10,000 votes of winning, ran a vigorous national campaign, while de Valera largely relied on the stature of his office.In a different era, Higgins will have to decide how to mix his role as head of state with the rough and tumble of a campaign.“He certainly won’t be shying away from campaigning, but he is mindful that he is head of state,” said one ally of the President. “I don’t think there will be posters. I don’t think he’ll be going around the country.”Another said his role as president will remain his “primary duty”, adding: “It won’t be like a Taoiseach, in that once the election is called, he is into the fray.”Participation in interviews and debates is likely, but anything further will depend on who Higgins’s rivals are. The summer months will see aspiring candidates attempt to muscle their way on to the field by securing the required support of 20 Oireachtas members or four county councils.Sinn Féin will continue to grapple with the prospect of standing a candidate, too.Higgins, as the sitting president, can nominate himself. The question of whether he will do so is likely to be answered next week.The question of whether Higgins is unbeatable – as is the received political wisdom – will have to wait until autumn."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3556901.1530911911!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chequers document may be bold enough to start serious negotiation with brussels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May speaks to members of her cabinet at the prime minister’s rural country residence, Chequers, west of London. Photograph: Joel RouseAFPGetty ImagesOn the face of it, much of what Theresa May’s cabinet agreed at Chequers is unworkable and unlikely to be accepted by the European Union. But the three-page document released after the day-long meeting represents an important political victory for the prime minister, who has faced down her Brexiteer ministers.The night before the Chequers meeting, seven of those ministers – led by Boris Johnson – met in the foreign office amid rumbles of outrage about leaked details of May’s proposal. Those leaks proved to be accurate and the final text promises everything the Brexiteers feared: full regulatory alignment with the EU for goods and agriculture, and a customs arrangement which treats Britain and the EU as “a common customs territory”.EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Friday restated Europe’s rejection of the idea that Britain should be part of the single market for goods rather than services. And he made clear that, if there is to be a “common rulebook” for regulation as May proposes, it will be the EU’s rulebook.Brussels is also sceptical about the latest customs proposal and May’s claim that Westminster will be able to choose which EU regulations to adopt in future will strike a discordant note in Europe.This Chequers statement was never going to be the blueprint for a final deal, however, but it may be bold enough to start a serious negotiation with Brussels. The most crucial passage for Ireland is buried in the middle of the text, almost as an aside.“Taken together, we noted that such a relationship would see the UK and the EU meet their commitments to Northern Ireland and Ireland through the overall future relationship: preserving the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK honouring the letter and the spirit of the Belfast Agreement and ensuring that the operational legal text the UK will nonetheless agree on the ‘backstop’ solution as part of the Withdrawal Agreement would not need to be brought into effect. In this context, we also noted that this proposal should allow both parties to resolve the remaining Withdrawal Agreement issues, including the ‘backstop’,” it says.This suggests that Britain is ready to agree a backstop that would allow for a separate customs and regulatory regime for Northern Ireland if no other solution is found to ensure that the Border remains open – on the basis that it will never be required. Coupled with Barnier’s offer to ensure that any checks on goods coming to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will be purely “technical and operational” this makes an early resolution of the backstop issue more likely.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Joel RouseMOD Crown Copyright Theresa May has persuaded her cabinet to back a soft Brexit, maintaining full regulatory alignment with Europe for goods and agricultural products and treating Britain and the EU as a single customs territory.A statement issued on Friday at the end of a day-long meeting at Chequers suggested that Britain is ready to reach an early agreement on the so-called backstop to guarantee that the Border remains open.Ms May said after the meeting that her cabinet had agreed a collective position for the future of Britain’s negotiations with the EU.“Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our parliament,” she said.“As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland. We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.”Negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU have been deadlocked on the issue of the Border backstop, with Brussels saying it must apply only to the North and London calling for a UK-wide solution to avoid creating barriers within the UK. The Chequers statement suggests that Britain’s new proposals would help to resolve the issue of the Border so that a backstop could be agreed with Brussels because it will never have to be used.“Such a relationship would see the UK and the EU meet their commitments to Northern Ireland and Ireland through the overall future relationship: preserving the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK honouring the letter and the spirit of the Belfast Agreement and ensuring that the operational legal text the UK will nonetheless agree on the ‘backstop’ solution as part of the withdrawal agreement would not need to be brought into effect.“In this context, we also noted that this proposal should allow both parties to resolve the remaining withdrawal agreement issues, including the ‘backstop’,” the statement says.The Government on Friday night welcomed the move by Ms May, and senior sources said the British government statement was “broadly in line” with what Dublin was expecting.In a statement issued late on Friday, the Government said that EU ministers would consider the UK proposals at a meeting in Brussels on July 20th.However, the Government statement emphasised the importance of the backstop.“While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard Border will be avoided,” it said.The Government called for the negotiations to be intensified. “Time is short,” it said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They cannot e at this time, he said.He added that the plan was to bring the trapped boys out if the rains worsen. If we think the big rain is coming then we will have to get them out, he said.We have plans and options but if the situation changes we have to adapt to it. This depends on the readiness of the kids to be able to e.A successful extraction would be a huge boost to rescuers who were mourning the tragic death of one of the ers. The death of Saman Kunan, 38, a volunteer and former Thai Navy Seal, came as a cruel jolt to the tireless efforts of ers, engineers and caving experts who have been working furiously to extract the children aged 11-16, and their coach, 25, since they were found sheltering in a muddy chamber on Monday.Petty Officer Kunan died on his way out of the cave complex after delivering air tanks to different locations along the treacherous submerged route that leads to the chamber some 2.5 miles from the main exit. “His job was to deliver oxygen.Thai Military wait for more water pumpsHe did not have enough on his way back,” confirmed Passakorn Boonyalak, Chiang Rai’s deputy governor.Kunan, who was a professionally trained er, appeared from his Facebook page to also be an avid runner and cyclist.The tragedy was a frightening reminder of how dangerous it would be to get the boys, who in a weakened state and some unable to swim, to e through winding, dark passages which take even fit, expert ers five hours, using four oxygen tanks, to battle through strong currents.“Inside the cave is tough,” said Thai Seal commander Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew.But he added: “I can guarantee that we will not panic, we will not stop our mission, we will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste.”Divers have questioned the high-risk strategy of extracting the boys through ing out, even though they are currently being trained to use scuba gear.Bin Bunluerit, famous for working with the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, one of Thailand’s largest rescue foundations said on Thursday that it was too dangerous.It’s “not working,” he said of efforts to drain the floodwater from the cave complex.“The water is still not going down. If you want it to go down by a metre, it’s going to take up to a month,” he told Khaosod news.But deteriorating conditions in the boys’ makeshift shelter, where oxygen levels have dropped to 15 per cent, from a usual level of 21 per cent, are raising anxiety levels, particularly with a dire weather forecast for the coming week that could result in them being trapped for months.A key task on Friday is to lay a pipe into their chamber to provide more air. But a search to find openings above the roof of the cave, in the hope of lifting the boys out, has been stepped up.A team of bird nest hunters and cliff climbing experts has been drafted in to sweep through thick foliage on the mountain over the cave to find possible new shafts inside.It is still unclear how the boys and their coach will escapeMeanwhile, an army of local volunteers has descended on the caves to support the rescuers.Panee Pakdee, 62, told The  she had been cooking 3,000 eggs a day for the teams since the start of the boys’ ordeal. “I wake up at 6am to take the first bus and then go into the kitchen as soon as I arrive to fry eggs,” she said.Ms Panee first learned about the children’s plight at her church, and could not sit still after seeing reports on the TV.“I came to give support and to pray to the Lord to open up the way for the kids,” she said.But amid the sadness of the day, FIFA’s president Gianni Infantino offered a glimmer of hope for the boys.“If, as we all hope, they are reunited with their families in the coming days and their health allows them to travel, FIFA would be delighted to invite them to attend the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow as our guests,” he wrote in a letter to the Football Association of Thailand.Please review our commenting policyWhat\u0026#39s it like to be LGBT and Conservative?Rees-Mogg says May\u0026#39s deal \u0026#39worse\u0026#39 than \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitVW owners left needing up to nine repairs and without their cars for months after emissions scandal \u0026#39fix\u0026#39 failsSchool bans \u0026#39flossing\u0026#39 dance because Fortnite moves are intimidating children on playgroundReshuffle threats and fake taxi firms: How the stage was set for Theresa May\u0026#39s coup de théâtre at ChequersFake vaccine video goes viral in Pakistan putting the global drive to eradicate polio at risk at the 11th hour Comment: England has indulged its \u0026#39underdog complex\u0026#39 for centuries.

One key aim of the trip is thought to be the return of the remains of US troops killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.Both sides have suggested Pyongyang is willing to turn over dozens if not hundreds of sets of remains.It is Mr Pompeo\u0026#39s third trip to PyongyangDoubts over the North\u0027s intentions have grown amid reports it is continuing to expand facilities related to its nuclear and missile programs and questions over how willing the North Korean dictator is to give up his nuclear arsenal.Mr Trump has faced criticism for suspending large-scale US military drills with South Korea before failing to receive a firm time frame for the North\u0027s denuclearisation process.On Friday night South Korean officials claimed North Korea appeared to be developing a new submarine capable of launching nuclear-armed ballistic missiles.Satellite imagery reviewed by the country\u0027s intelligence officials suggested North Korea is constructing the submarine in a facility on the east coast of the country, the Wall Street Journal reported.Mr Pompeo met with Kim Yong Chol, a senior official a who has been something of a point-man on Washington negotiations, on Friday for his first round of talks.The more you come, more trust we can build between one another, Mr Kim told America\u0027s top diplomat.It was not clear if Mr Pompeo would meet directly with Kim Jong-un, as he had done previously, but the diplomat reportedly brought with him a CD with the Elton John song “Rocket Man” as a gift.Mr Trump repeatedly derided Kim as “Little Rocket Man” during heightened tensions between the two leaders, something Kim reportedly raised at their June 12 summit.According to the South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo, Mr Trump asked Mr Pompeo to bring a copy of the CD and a letter during his subsequent trip to the state.Please review our commenting policyWhat\u0026#39s it like to be LGBT and Conservative?Rees-Mogg says May\u0026#39s deal \u0026#39worse\u0026#39 than \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitVW owners left needing up to nine repairs and without their cars for months after emissions scandal \u0026#39fix\u0026#39 failsSchool bans \u0026#39flossing\u0026#39 dance because Fortnite moves are intimidating children on playgroundReshuffle threats and fake taxi firms: How the stage was set for Theresa May\u0026#39s coup de théâtre at ChequersFake vaccine video goes viral in Pakistan putting the global drive to eradicate polio at risk at the 11th hour Comment: England has indulged its \u0026#39underdog complex\u0026#39 for centuries.

But it won’t stop the nation partying today like England have already won the World Cup.England play Sweden at 3pm this afternoon for a place in the semi-finals of the World Cup their biggest match in more than a quarter of a century. Supermarkets expect to sell record amounts of beer, sausages and burgers while pubs will pour a staggering 18 million pints.As many as 5,000 fans have made the arduous, expensive trek to Samara, 700 miles from Moscow, to attend the game with up to 30 million will watch on BBC television.The nation will come to a standstill, gripped by the prospect that Gareth Southgate’s team, the youngest and most inexperienced left in the tournament, is just two games away from only a second World Cup Final.The game has sparked a spending, eating and drinking boom, helped by a heatwave and temperatures predicted to hit 91F, the hottest of the year. Samara, on the banks of the Volga river and in a town famous as ‘space city’ for its manufacture of Soyuz rockets, will be just as warm.Fans are ready for blast off. Economists have predicted an additional £6.5 billion spent thanks to England’s unexpected World Cup run.The supermarkets are gearing up for asiles to be cleared well in time for kickoff. By then shops and roads will be empty, wedding timings rearranged.Even God has made provisions for the football, with the Church of England\u0027s General Synod rearranging its Saturday afternoon timetable to let attendees watch the game without missing multiple sessions of the meeting.Announcing the change on Friday, the Revd Canon Sue Booys, chair of the business committee, received a round of applause from members as she said the match would also become the first ever sporting occasion to be screened in the debating chamber.Asda has launched “Operation It’s coming home” - a play on the England anthem ‘Football’s coming home’ - and expects to sell 8.5 million sausages over the weekend. The retailer has already sold over 20,000 sets of George bunting and over 3,000 bandanas and whistles. Tesco will shift four million burgers, three million punnets of strawberries and  and a staggering 50 million bottles and cans of beer. “Fantastic weather and the world’s biggest sporting event are creating a real carnival atmosphere across Britain this week,” said Tesco’s Natalie Bastow.The 21 best places to watch the World Cup in LondonWaitrose has recorded a 21 per cent spike in Pimm’s sales and a 45 per cent rise in sparkling wine and champagne. Sainsbury’s will see a 40 per cent increase in  sales of pizza, crisps and other party food while Argos, which it owns, will sell 80 per cent more barbecues than normal.Pubs will do a roaring, possibly record  trade, with one pub company calling it the ‘perfect storm’.. The British Beer and Pub Association said 18 million pints will be poured and drunk today alone - seven million more than usual - and takings on the day soar to £100m.Drinkers in London have had to wait 20 minutes just to get into some pubs and 45 minutes queuing at the bar. “It is the perfect storm – England playing in the quarter finals on a Saturday afternoon,” said Eddie Gershon, spokesman for J D Wetherspoon, which has 880 pubs, “Even those diehard non-football fans who prefer to go shopping on a Saturday afternoon are likely to be in our pubs for this momentous occasion.”Budweiser, the US beer company, announced it was increasing production to cope with demand. The company even went so far as to promise free beers to fans if England wins the World Cup, a giveaway that it might just be held to.Bookmakers are also predicting record gambling on an England match with £50 million being bet. Expect handwringing from bookmakers if England win, who are set to lose £100 million. This is, without doubt, the biggest match of the World Cup so far,” said William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly. “We project that most of that money will be on England to win and Harry Kane to score first.

The couple rollerbladed down the promenade in Samara, singing: “Football’s coming home.”Miss McDonnell said: “It’s worth every penny. England can win this world cup. Steve might be Northern Irish but he’s still cheering on England.”The couple live in Hong Kong and obtained the tickets from a contact in China.

I promise to take the very best care of the kids, he said in a note given to a er on Friday and published on the Thai Navy SEAL Facebook page on Saturday.Thank you for all the moral support and I apologise to the parents.Combination of photos shows handwritten messages written by boys and football coach trapped in Tham Luang cave in Chiang RaiOther touching notes signed by members of the Wild Boar team were directed to their families, many of whom have kept an anxious vigil outside the cave for a fortnight.Don’t worry dad and mum, said a note from one of the boys who gave his nickname as Bew.I have been away for two weeks but will come back and help you sell your stuff. His family are shopkeepers.Another note, from Dom said he was fine but the air here is a little cold.Don\u0027t forget to set up my birthday party, he added.Another, identified as Tun, writes: Mom and Dad, please don\u0027t worry, I am fine.

Grandpa, uncle, mom dad, and siblings I love you all. I\u0027m happy being here inside, the navy SEALS have taken good care. Love you all.The boys are being trained in the basics of ing in case the flood waters force authorities into a sudden evacuation through twisting and jagged passageways.In an update in the early hours of Saturday, rescue operation chief Narongsak Osottanakorn said it was not suitable to make the boys e to safety yet.However, he indicated that further downpours might speed up attempts to extract them, despite the dangers.The risks were underlined by the death on Friday of a former Thai Navy SEAL er, who ran out of oxygen while returning from the chamber where the boys are trapped.Saman Kunan had been trying to establish an air line to the chamber when he passed out and perished.We lost one man, but we still have faith to carry out our work, Navy Seal commander Apakorn Yookongkaew said, adding that rescuers have a limited time to extract the boys.Diving cylinders are prepared at a makeshift camp at the entrance of Tham Luang Nang Non cavesAuthorities continue to pursue another  option, which is finding a shaft or drilling into the mountain in which the cave is located to find a sort of back door entrance.More than 100 chimneys are being drilled into the mountainside in a frantic bid to reach a Thai youth football team trapped in a cave complex below, the head of the rescue mission said Saturday.Some are as deep as 400 metres... but they still cannot find their location yet, Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters, adding the mission lacked the technology to pinpoint where they are staying.Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, on Friday dispatched engineers from his companies, SpaceX and The Boring Company, to help with the rescue effort.Mr Musk initially responded to requests for help from Twitter users, but later outlined a more detailed strategy using his companies’ pumps, battery packs and tubes, to help the boys, aged 11-16, escape the horrific imprisonment they have now endured for two weeks.Thailand cave rescue, in picturesThe businessman suggested inserting a one-metre diameter nylon tube through the cave network and inflating it with air like a bouncy castle to create an air tunnel underwater against the cave roof, allowing the children to walk through it and duck through the narrow sections.Ekkapol\u0027s message is the first from the coach, whose role in the team\u0027s predicament has split Thai social media.Many have lauding him after reports he gave his share of food to the kids before they were located and helped them get through nine days in the darkness.Others have criticised him for agreeing to take the young boys into the cave during the monsoon season.The group entered the cave on June 23 and got trapped as floodwaters tore in.A massive rescue operation is under way, with high-powered pumps working round-the-clock to reduce the water level inside the cave, while rescue experts weigh their options to extract the kids.Please review our commenting policyWhat\u0026#39s it like to be LGBT and Conservative?Rees-Mogg says May\u0026#39s deal \u0026#39worse\u0026#39 than \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitVW owners left needing up to nine repairs and without their cars for months after emissions scandal \u0026#39fix\u0026#39 failsSchool bans \u0026#39flossing\u0026#39 dance because Fortnite moves are intimidating children on playgroundReshuffle threats and fake taxi firms: How the stage was set for Theresa May\u0026#39s coup de théâtre at ChequersFake vaccine video goes viral in Pakistan putting the global drive to eradicate polio at risk at the 11th hour Comment: England has indulged its \u0026#39underdog complex\u0026#39 for centuries.

We’ll take it for granted that it won’t last and that we’ll pay for it later in the summer. But the truth is that the last four years have been globally the hottest on record. And the places most seriously affected by this are not in a position to laugh it off as a little temporary blip. More than 40 million people in South Asia have been affected by floods in the past year. Severe drought still prevails in sub-Saharan Africa. And the succession of hurricanes – Harvey, Maria, Irma – hitting Texas, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean are part of a pattern of extreme weather generally agreed to be rooted in climate change.The overwhelming consensus is that our levels of fossil fuel consumption play a significant role in the processes of climate change hence the growing campaign to rein in fossil fuel extraction worldwide, and to put pressure on oil and gas companies to take prompt and effective action to reduce carbon emissions in line with the levels urged in the Paris Agreement of 2015.  The threat of significant estment is increasingly being used to bring this pressure to bear. And it is something of a landmark that, in a ComRes poll conducted in October last year, 78 per cent of those polled agreed that it was morally wrong to invest in companies whose activities intensified climate change.Morally wrong: profitable or not, certain kinds of industrial activity are now widely seen as simply not acceptable by many in the population, especially among the under-thirties. The university in which I work is still wrestling with the question of how it responds to the very vocal and consistent concerns of its student members about its investment policy and has already sketched the direction in which it wants to move, towards a carbon-neutral future.So where in all this is the Christian Church, with its historic claim to offer a moral compass for society? This weekend, the General Synod of the Church of England will debate its holdings in some of the world’s largest – and most criticised – oil and gas companies, thanks to a motion from local churches in the Oxford diocese. Palm trees damaged by Hurricane Maria stand in Marigot, Dominica, on Monday, May 7, 2018It will not be the first church to raise the issue. The Lutheran Church of Sweden, the Anglican Church in Southern Africa and the World Council of Churches have already agreed that they will not risk profiting from the suffering of their brothers and sisters around the world as a result of environmentally irresponsible behaviour by extractive industries. They have moved to disinvest from fossil fuel companies that are taking no steps to align with the targets set in Paris two and a half years ago.So far, like many large institutions, the Church of England has argued for a strategy of engagement and influence from within. But the question has to be asked: how effective has this proved to date? At the AGM of Shell in May a resolution was put forward by church-based investors calling for the setting of clear carbon emission reductions along Paris lines. The motion was opposed by the management and received only 5.5 per cent of the votes. Is engagement working?.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}What we are seeing in climate change is something that will move people on a scale that we have never dreamt of in the history of humankind.Archbishop Justin WelbyAt the same time, it is clear that Shell and similar companies are apprehensive about disinvestment – and about the looming threat of litigation based on adverse environmental effects. It is a good moment to sharpen up the response. The motion at Synod envisages disinvestment from any company that has not produced a Paris-compliant business plan by 2020. In other words, it is not calling for instant disinvestment or an instant turn-around by companies what it is doing is giving notice that the church believes this matter to be too urgent to be left to what can be done through engagement alone. There must be a red line or two laid down.Mountain guide Christian Pletscher walks towards the Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland, which has retreated 3km since 1870The Church of England has a record of using its investment policy to advance what it believes to be Christian and ethical goals, putting pressure on South Africa in the apartheid era, dropping its investment in Vedanta some years ago in protest about that company’s environmental record and employment practices, monitoring any possible involvement in arms trading, and so on. It has been willing to step out as a moral leader in a number of areas, and its present leadership has been clear about the gravity of the climate change question. Archbishop Justin Welby spoke forcefully last week at the London Stock Exchange about this as an existential problem for the entire global community in a way that nothing else is, and warned of how, unless we could control it, it would control our future and our children’s.  This weekend’s debate is an opportunity for the Church of England to encourage our society to take control of a question which threatens to overwhelm us before it is too late. On Ash Wednesday in 2012, I and other church leaders signed a declaration committing the churches to find joy in creation, to take responsibility for the world we inhabit, to listen to the voices of those most touched by the effects of environmental disaster and degradation – and to act with hope.But our world needs more than encouraging words, and that declaration still waits to be put into full and energetic practice. The Church can do more than hand-wringing or exhortation. The environmental issue is one that so easily appears as too big for any of us to handle.Reasoned but bold intervention, pushing the expectations laid down in Paris in 2015 and at other meetings since then a bit further towards realisation, is one clear way in which Christians can discharge their responsibility to witness to the possibility of a world where we have at last recognised that the only just human future is one where we acknowledge the neighbour’s jeopardy as ours too. As Archbishop Justin says, no current issue brings this more dramatically into focus than the challenges of climate change.                  Rowan Williams is the former Archbishop of Canterbury and Chair of Christian AidChurch of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyWhat\u0026#39s it like to be LGBT and Conservative?Rees-Mogg says May\u0026#39s deal \u0026#39worse\u0026#39 than \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitVW owners left needing up to nine repairs and without their cars for months after emissions scandal \u0026#39fix\u0026#39 failsSchool bans \u0026#39flossing\u0026#39 dance because Fortnite moves are intimidating children on playgroundReshuffle threats and fake taxi firms: How the stage was set for Theresa May\u0026#39s coup de théâtre at ChequersFake vaccine video goes viral in Pakistan putting the global drive to eradicate polio at risk at the 11th hour Comment: England has indulged its \u0026#39underdog complex\u0026#39 for centuries.

She is actually quite worried. I find this absolutely ludicrous that my child now feels this way about a daft dance move.Another said: Bullying is rife in all schools, blaming it on a gamedanceparents is just another poor excuse.Clarifying the school\u0027s position Jody Le Bredonchel, assistant head teacher, said: In our school, a few incidents have taken place at lunchtime whereby pupils have been upset by some unpleasant dances. Our main priority is the safeguarding and well being of the children and this caused us to speak with all the pupils and reinforce our expectations.Fortnite, which can be played on games consoles, mobile phones and computers, is a survival game which sees players work together to kill off zombie-like creatures.Please review our commenting policyWhat\u0026#39s it like to be LGBT and Conservative?Rees-Mogg says May\u0026#39s deal \u0026#39worse\u0026#39 than \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitVW owners left needing up to nine repairs and without their cars for months after emissions scandal \u0026#39fix\u0026#39 failsReshuffle threats and fake taxi firms: How the stage was set for Theresa May\u0026#39s coup de théâtre at ChequersFake vaccine video goes viral in Pakistan putting the global drive to eradicate polio at risk at the 11th hour Comment: England has indulged its \u0026#39underdog complex\u0026#39 for centuries.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It would mean Britain volunteering to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods, covering only those necessary to provide for frictionless trade at the border.The EU\u0027s Court of Justice will play a role in enforcing EU regulations in the UK through a joint commmittee set up to provide binding independent arbitration.The document insisted the Luxembourg-based court could be an interpreter of the rules but cannot resolve disputes.Theresa May holding a Cabinet meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireIn a warning shot to the European Commission negotiating team, the document concluded that the Government will continue preparations for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of \u0027no deal\u0027.It added: Given the short period remaining before the necessary conclusion of negotiations in the autumn, we agreed preparations should be stepped up.The agreed Cabinet statement, which will form the Government\u0027s negotiating position in the wrangle with Brussels, was released after around nine hours of talks at the Prime Minister\u0027s country residence in Buckinghamshire.As the meeting rumbled on during the afternoon, Downing Street aides described the discussions as positive and constructive.At one stage ministers could be seen jacketless seated around a garden table at the rear of the manor house in the sunshine.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, one of the leading Cabinet critics of Mrs May\u0027s plan, was spotted with his sleeves rolled up, was seen gesturing forcefully at the Prime Minister sitting opposite him during the discussion.Earlier, Mrs May sought to face down Cabinet rebels threatening to resign over the plan by signalling that she was prepared for an emergency reshuffle in the event of anyone walking out of the Chequers gathering.PATheresa May speaking at a Cabinet meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireIn a sign of her preparations, her Chief Whip Julian Smith met a series of junior ministers including Dominic Raab, Rishi Sunak, Steve Baker, Suella Braverman and Kit Malthouse to gauge their views on the issue and ambition for promotion.People need to know that we have a big talent pool, said one ally of the Prime Minister about the threat of resignations.Mrs May even enlisted her predecessor David Cameron to help shore up her position ahead of the meeting.The former prime minister met Mr Johnson to urge him to stay loyal to Mrs May and not resign.Talks were held amidst the utmost secrecy, with ministers instructed to hand in their mobile phones and smart watches on arrival at Chequers.

many of them are already mulling their own strategies for how they could seize the top job, should she fall.In the corridors of Westminster plotting is already afoot, and many ministers and MPs have been going over what to do if the Prime Minister cant get the Government through the next crucial few months.Mrs May faces a tough fight to keep her Cabinet, backbenchers and European colleagues from tearing chunks out of each other.And theres every risk that her precarious position, with a slim majority in Parliament - could topple over.Last year furious Tories said she was just a caretaker Prime Minister after she lost their election, so who could be in the battle to replace her? The Foreign Secretary is still a firm favourite to take over from Mrs May if she quits or is forced out of No10.One of the main faces of the Brexit campaign and still popular with the public, Boris hasnt been shy on making big interventions on our EU exit in the last year.But he chickened out of voting against Heathrow last month by fleeing overseas - leading many to ask whether hes lost some of his bullish bravado. Since he took over from Amber Rudd following the Windrush debacle, Sajid Javid has been making his mark on the Home Office.The new Home Secretary - one of the great offices of state - could be one to keep an eye on. Leader of the backbench Brexiteers, Mr Rees-Moggs popularity among the public has somewhat worn off in recent months.But hes still in a hugely influential role as head of the European Research Group, and has respect among many of his fellow MPs.Hes also reportedly seeking out a PR firm - possibly to help convert his supporters into votes in a future leadership race.However, hes never held a ministerial job and jumping straight to becoming Prime Minister would be a pretty big leap - even for the Mogg, who says he doesnt want the job anyway. The man has made a pretty impressive comeback since stabbing Boris Johnson in the back after the EU referendum - by announcing he would abandon his mate and go for the leadership alone.Since being brought back into the Cabinet hes made headlines with a string of well-received environmental policies - from crackdowns on puppy farming to eco-friendly coffee cups.Dont underestimate what this Brexiteer is capable of. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has been making waves in recent weeks with her intervention in the tax debate.She made a bold speech saying the Tories shouldnt be just banning things and raising taxes in a way that is unConservative to try and compete with Jeremy Corbyns Labour.That followed a huge digital drive to get more followers on her Twitter and Instagram.Critics said she was making a naked bid for No10 - that would be quite something indeed. The Brexit Secretary has ruffled feathers by dropping hints he could quit his role over Mrs Mays strategy in recent weeks.After a bitter row about customs relations with Brussels, the ex-SAS fighter has been knuckling down and helping to deliver our EU exit strategy.This week he held crunch talks with the PM over her too soft Brexit plans, showing hes not afraid to stand up for what he wants, but would be be able to bring a warring cabinet together afterwards? Despite the endless flak that comes with being Health Secretary, Mr Hunt fought to cling on to his job during Mrs Mays last reshuffle, leading many to think that this man has a bit more steel that was first thought.And hes managed to win more cash for the NHS as the health service marks its 70th birthday this year.Despite his poor public image, this Remainer turned Brexiteer could be a key uniting candidate in any such leadership race.The Defence Secretary, though new to being a minister, is also being seen as positioning himself ahead of a possible leadership election.Hes been battling the Treasury very publicly for more money ever since he took over from Sir Michael Fallon at the end of last year.And he was even reported to have said he could bring down Mrs May in a bitter row over funding just last month.But his weedy comments telling Russia to shut up and go away may put people off the idea hes a strong enough leader to get Britain through Brexit.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: “We are still encouraging our customers to voluntarily use water efficiently, by avoiding the use of water hungry devices, particularly outside in the garden.However, if demand does not reduce in the next few days we’ll have no choice but to introduce enforced restrictions.Any usage ban is likely to be staggered, hitting households first before commercial outlets.Other water companies are expected to announce similar plans imminently.It comes after one of the hottest and driest Junes on record — with the current heatwave which started last Monday now the longest since 1976.Average rainfall for the UK last month was just 35.4mm, less than half the normal amount, according to the Met Office.The South East and central southern areas were the worst hit with just 3mm of rain falling throughout June - six per cent of its 50mm average.Parts of the country have dried up, including sections of the River Tyne (before and now, above).The Met Office said it will continue this weekend, with highs of 91F (33C).But Andy White, from industry body Consumer Council for Water, said: “We expect United Utilities to exhaust every opportunity to avoid restrictions.”Britains record-breaking 33C heatwave hasnt just left Brits sweltering, with the roads also feeling the heat as a bin lorry sank into melted tarmac .Stunned locals in Newbury, Berks, found the stuck truck blocking a street after its wheels became lodged in the liquid tarmac in 30C heat yesterday.Weather forecaster Emma Salter said: Theres no let up in sight in terms of the dry weather and high temperatures through the week.She added: Its pretty much dry across the board and no sign of rain.Temperatures will reach a still blazing 32C today with sunshine for most sending Brits flocking to beer gardens across the country.Pub industry insiders predict an extra 8million pints will be sold on Saturday — netting landlords £24million more in revenue than a typical day.Storms had been predicted for Friday earlier in the week but Ms Salter said these were now looking very unlikely and had been removed from the forecast.Scotland might see some rain in the coming days, she said, but the rest of the country could expect it to stay dry until the middle of July.She added: From Monday or Tuesday the really high temperatures will start to gradually come down, but it will still be in the high 20s so it will be less hot rather than cooler.On Thursday there were flash floods in Kent following a sudden downpour after a long stretch of scorching weather and uninterrupted sunshine left the ground unable to absorb the deluge.The thunderstorm in Tunbridge Wells led to train and bus delays.Video posted online showed fast-moving water gushing through streets in the town after around 20 minutes of rainfall between 4pm and 5pm on Thursday, the Met Office said.And in Herefordshire dramatic photos showed the River Teme all but disappeared after evaporating in the parched conditions.Environment Agency workers desperately rushed to rescue more than 500 salmon and trout trapped in isolated pockets of water before they vanished in the heat.There are fears that continuous dry weather expected over the coming days — expected to beat the record hot spell of 1976 — could cause similar problems with the Upper River Wye also currently at a low level.The government has asked for the public to conserve more water and take no longer than four minutes in the shower.A hosepipe ban has also been enforced in Northern Ireland amid record temperatures, with Belfast recording 29.5C this week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A total, humiliating capitulation.”But Europhile business groups hailed the PMs plans as a genuine confidence boost.The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry said it was proof the Government was listening to warnings from big firms.Vote Leave chief and Environment Secretary Michael Gove played a key role in winning the peace for the PM by siding with her in order to isolate the hardline Brexiteers.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it.Mrs May will now publish a White Paper and address MPs on Monday - setting up a long summer of negotiations with Brussels on the offer.The PM said she was hopeful of the details being well received by EU leaders, adding: “Now we want to get on at pace, negotiate this with the EU and bring prosperity and security to people.”Despite bitter divisions within her top team, Mrs May was able to convince a majority of her 29 ministers around to the climbdown plan during four hours of debate in the her sweltering 16th county mansion in Buckinghamshire.Sources claimed that Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid were instrumental in backing the PM’s plan to tip the balance in favour of the PM and leaving the Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis isolated.Another source said the talks went on for “four hours” with lunch and dinner served in the grand house, insisting: “There was plenty of good humour and it was low on tension”.But another insider added there were “obviously fraught moments”.As news of the deal filtered across Whitehall insiders expressed their shock at “the scale of the climbdown”, expressing surprise that no Brexit minister had quit over the deal.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash

details of the terms of the deal hours before critical ministers at the summit were given back their mobile phones.And MPs cautioned that the fact Brussels Brexit boss Michel Barnier was “welcoming this White Paper as just a start” meant they were already publicly expecting the UK to slide further towards the EU.Earlier in the day Mr Barnier had opened the EU’s door to compromises by repeatedly refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he hinted that the EU is waiting to kickstart the negotiations on renewed terms if Mrs May softens her red lines.But one MP said: “I need to see the detail but I’m extremely wary.“It sounds to me like we’re going to be rule taker rather than the a rule maker.“It’s feels we are danger of total capitulation to Brussels.”And Brexiteer critics were giving an unlikely boost from arch-remainer Sir Nick Clegg who said they were right to reject Mrs May’s third way custom fudge that would lead to “vast red tape” while “smugglers would boom” and “Parliament left humiliated” as a simple rubber stamper.Tempers had already reached boiling point in the run up to the summit after Downing Street publicly warned one in Government who quit could watch her soft-Brexit march continue from the sidelines.No10 insiders revealed emergency reshuffle plans were already in place incase of Ministerial walkouts from her crunch Brexit summit.The day was broken into three sections with the first seeing Brexit guru Olly Robbins brief ministers on the “Available Outcomes in Light of the EU’s Current Position”.But the testy exchanges were seen in the afternoon’s session titled The UK’s Proposed Approach”.Before the ministers had even sat down around the table Downing Street infuriated them by warning that they would have to get a taxi home as they would be stripped of their limos immediately if they walked out in protest.A senior Government source said: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis the local cab firm are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country but it will still be a long walk as it is a mile long driveway.The official raged: “A select number of narcissistic, leadership dominated cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away.”And The Sun revealed that the whips had summoned dozens of junior ministers for a series of meetings to sound them out over the PM’s plans as possible future cabinet replacements in the case of a mass walkout.Housing minister Dominic Raab, Crime minister Victoria Atkins and Local Government minister Kit Malthouse were touted as possible replacements.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Youre partying with them! But when we come, its an issue.”Following an internal investigation, the Trilogy Real Estate Group confirmed that they felt Walker had acted inappropriately and had fired her.In a statement, the company said: “After assessing statements from Ms. Porter and determining that this former employees actions violate our companys policies \u0026amp beliefs, she is no longer employed by Riverset Apartments.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000417200227.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"are tube strikes london pride parade 2018 best journey planner","story":"Performances will take place in Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square and around Soho.

Any minister freelancing with long personal manifestos or private recorded statements will be fired.Other delighted cabinet ministers included Business Secretary Greg Clark, defender of Airbus and Jaguar Land Rover, who said it was a \"very positive conclusion\" which meant \"zero friction\" for trade between UK and EU countries and Justice Secretary David Gauke, who praised the \"positive support from cabinet for Theresa May and her Brexit plan\".Not much from the Brexiteers just yet.:: \u0027Sell out\u0027 free trade area plans torn apart by BrexiteersThe statement of agreement was emailed to the press as dinner began, without cabinet ministers having contact with their advisers, giving two hours for newspapers to conjure \"PM wrestles Brexit triumph\" style headlines, on a day when most of the country will want to return to the World Cup, rather than squabbling political parties.The European Union will not accept this plan, and that much has been made clear.But that was easy for them while there was no plan and no unified position even to have to consider.Now there is something for them to bite into. A conversation to be started. Their initial response to actually having a negotiation partner was warmish. But they were careful not to sound too dismissive about the wider attempt to enjoy existing economic terms with the single market where the UK feels it is in its interest, without the payments or adherence to freedom of movement.The most significant piece of the agreement is that the government has changed its position on what it wants from ongoing trade with the European Union.No longer is it \"as frictionless as possible\", which was always fairly meaningless but actually \"frictionless\".The PM has been persuaded by the arguments of business, the car industry and Airbus in particular, that any border checks would fundamentally imperil the business strategies that have led them to thrive in the UK and in particular their supply chains.The answer is a \"free trade area for goods\" with a common rule book which is in essence participation in a goods customs union and single market, with some eventual flexibility to conduct independent trade externally, when tariff tracking technology is developed.:: Behind the scenes of crunch Brexit talksIt is not membership of these structures however.The UK becomes rule-taker of the EU interpretation of these rules for globalised industries.The theory, however, is that the UK will have had strong influence in the setting of the global standards in the first place, so not a total rule-taker.It is a position that envisages the development in coming decades of global standards in advanced manufacturing and trade. The inclusion of agriculture in this system is to keep borders open both in Northern Ireland and at Dover, Holyhead and the Channel Tunnel.The gravitational pull on any future government not to change tariffs will be strong, but the UK parliament will have the power to change them.Britain will have taken back some control, but in other senses (directly influencing the EU rules) have lost it.Brexiteer backbenchers were restrained immediately, but anger is brewing. \"As bad as I feared,\" said one.A despondent Brexiteer MP said he was \"deeply disappointed, this is associate membership of the EU, we haven\u0027t worked so hard all these years for this\".One very pro-Brexit junior minister told me: \"If this was the final deal, then I could probably live with it as a necessary compromise. But EU will never accept it (cherry picking, four freedoms indivisible etc), so what happens next?\" Indeed why you would choose to lay out such tough red lines if you thought things might end up here is a bit of a mystery.How Brexiteer cabinet ministers have signed up to this having argued so publicly for \"a clean Brexit\" is another.\"I can\u0027t see how they can accept this and not look a laughing stock,\" one former senior minister said.It is early days yet. One ministerial aide suggested the analogy of a budget that unravels after a time delay of two days, would be the correct analogy.The most evident possible method for that is the section on a \"labour mobility partnership\" which suggests maintaining mutual freedom to move and then apply for study and jobs [presumably not benefits] between UK and EU. This will help lubricate any single market deal. It will also inflame internal political opposition.There is also a section on \"no deal\" preparations, meant as a stick for the EU and a carrot for Brexiteers.If the PM cannot stomach a Canada-style trade deal because of the negative impact on advanced manufacturers, it seems that \"no deal\" is inconceivable.So we are left in an extraordinary position.The hard Brexiteers need the EU to reject this out of hand now.The EU will have noted the shift in Government position, the actual adoption of one, and see a landing point at least for many years that is close to the European Economic Area (EEA) plus customs union solution they anticipate and prefer.We are probably three quarters of the way there already.Do they split the difference and pay lip service to a magical Europe-wide tariff refund IT system in a few years? Or do they undo the PM\u0027s impressive manoeuvres with outright rejection?The devil will be in the detail, to be released in the white paper."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-thailand-cave-boys_4351503.jpg?20180703153714 ","title":"elon musk ramps up efforts to help save boys trapped in thailand cave","story":"\"Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks.\"Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.\":: \u0027Take me for grilled pork\u0027: Notes written by boys trapped in cave in fullMusk\u0027s company, Boring Co, which digs tunnels for transport systems and has advanced ground-penetrating radar, is being utilised to help rescue the team. \"Will do my best to help the team,\" he tweeted, before adding: \"The team will dig deep and will help at the best of ability.\"Among his tweets about the rescue, he also said: \"But let\u0027s not submit to the bad mood entirely.

Our team connected and provided some prep feedback to your team. For pumps, cave has narrowest 70cm cross section and about 5km to 13 guys.

Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof \u0026 auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.\" One of the main working theories of how to retrieve the boys is to train them to dive out of the cave.The boys are said to be in good health and have practised wearing diving masks and breathing in preparation for the potential complex dive.However, the dive is complex - with one Navy SEAL dying during the rescue efforts - and many of the boys do not know how to swim.   Alternative options are being considered, including finding a shaft or drilling into the mountain in which the cave is located. Another option is to wait until the monsoon season ends in several months and for the waters trapping them to recede."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/02/2048x1152/skynews-finns-law-finn-dave-wardell_4238696.jpg?20180223121606 ","title":"finn is my best friend this is why the law must change","story":"Finn was just doing his job as a police dog and didn\u0027t deserve to be attacked.These animals work as hard as any police officer and often we ask them to deal with the very worst and most dangerous elements of policing.

Compare the hype of the 2006 World Cup to 2018, what’s missing? England flags. In 2006, I remember going into shops, bars, schools – you couldn’t walk 20 metres without seeing an England flag. Whether sticking out of a car window, bunting going across a school playground or hanging over a pub window - England flags were everywhere. Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury’s would have shelves full of all sorts of England merchandise – this World Cup, I can’t find any!  Over the years, flying the flag has become more and more synonymous with the far-right – but why should they have any more right to fly the St George’s Cross than you or I? The English flag has become associated with the national front, the EDL and other far right groups– it frustrates me. It frustrates me because we have allowed this to happen.  Collectively, we hesitate to fly the English flag with pride during major sporting events because we are worried about the connotations behind the way it has been hijacked. When our sporting men and women represent us across the world, we should all be able to fly the flag with pride. No more should this be the case than right now, especially given the fantastic chance England have. I am proud to be born and raised in England and enjoy supporting my national team, England. With millions of other fans across the country, I am not alone.  I want the England flag to be associated with English sporting successes and I don\u0027t want us to hesitate flying it. It should be associated with Freddie Flintoff and the team winning the ashes, Bobby Moore lifting the World Cup, with Anthony Joshua beating Wilder – not far-right extremists fighting police down Whitehall.

The panicking Prime Minister had feared mass resignations and was even drawing up an emergency reshuffle. But despite weeks of threats to quit, Brexiteer Tories appeared to bottle it at a 12-hour Chequers showdown - which had been dubbed The Body Bag Summit. Mrs May announced a big shift to a \u0027softer\u0027 Brexit after treating ministers to whisky-cured salmon and whisky barrel chips at her country retreat. But within minutes of the announcement tonight, The Times reported that Mrs May told senior allies she would sack Boris Johnson if he seeks to undermine the Brexit negotiating position agreed by her cabinet.  Brexiteers Boris, Michael Gove and David Davis had previously hinted they were ready to walk. They were even warned they\u0027d have to swap their ministerial cars for a local taxi for the 40-mile trip back to London if they quit. But tonight - while they were still at Chequers, without their phones - Mrs May announced her Cabinet had agreed a collective position for future UK negotiations with Brussels.   Speaking after the meeting, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the Chequers plan would be assessed to see if it is workable and realistic. A round of UK-EU negotiations will take place in the week beginning July 16, he added.  The new plan explained - and why the EU could still reject it The vulnerable PM broke the deadlock by coming up with a peace offering for both the Remain and Leave camps. In a bid to solve the Northern Ireland issue, she now wants to keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - which critics had feared would make it harder to get a US trade deal. The PM claimed this will help the UK avoid friction in trade - protecting jobs and businesses. But in a desperate bid to prevent Brexiteers resigning, she also said Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. The olive branch to the Brexiteers means Mrs May remains vulnerable - because there is no guarantee the EU will accept her new plan. In a sign of nerves across government, the Cabinet also agreed to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit.  More details of the plan The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, which left-wing critics - including Jeremy Corbyn - say prevent the government intervening to help crisis-hit industry. On the other hand, Tory Brexiteers could be angry at how courts will intervene in disputes. UK courts, not the European Court of Justice, would rule on disputes in the UK - but would have to pay due regard to EU case law in areas with a common rulebook.  What happens next The Prime Minister now plans to publish a more detailed White Paper next week as she mounts a tour of EU capitals - to persuade leaders to accept it. Speaking tonight after a marathon day of talks at the 16th-century manor house, Mrs May said: Today in detailed discussions the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU. Our proposal will create a UK - EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament. She claimed this would meet our commitments in Northern Ireland. The PM added: Next week we will be publishing a white paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders. Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.

A new report says they are the “lifeblood” of the economy and every \u0026pound1 invested in bus services would generate \u0026pound3.32 of economic benefits. It revealed that bus passengers make 1.4 billion shopping trips and spend around \u0026pound27billion on retail goods every year. Buses are the main mode of travel to city centres and are used even more than cars. People who travel in by bus account for 29% of spending in cities.  Every day, almost 2.5 million people all over Britain travel to work by bus, and a million more use the bus as a vital back up. Yet since the Tories came to power in 2010 bus services have been savaged. Steve Chambers, of the Campaign for Better Transport and Greener Journeys, said: ”Our latest report confirms that the slow death of the supported bus continues, with local authority bus budgets suffering yet another cut this year. “The resulting cuts to services mean many people no longer have access to public transport, with rural areas hit especially hard.” He said evening and weekend services were often first to go leaving people cut off from work, education, shops and evening entertainment. The Campaign for Better Transport recommends targeted investment in buses to play a key role in the Mirror’s High Street Fightback campaign. But the Tories have cut funding for buses by \u0026pound182million, nearly half. At the same time fares have gone up by 13% above inflation and 3,347 routes have been axed or reduced.

The ship - which is really called RRS Sir David Attenborough - will be operated by the British Antarctic Survey and will provide scientists with state-of-the-art facilities to allow them to conduct research in some of the most inhospitable conditions in the world. The launch will be attended by 2,000 Cammell Laird staff and local dignitaries. Broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, who the ship is named after, is also expected to be present. The vessel will descend down Cammell Laird’s slipway at 12.20pm on July 14 in order to catch the high tide.  The ship was almost named RRS Boaty McBoatface after a competition to christen the ship was launched back in 2016. More than 124,000 people voted for the suggestion, but the Natural Environment Research Council decided not to go with it. Instead, one of the vessel’s mini-submarines was given the name. The ship is the largest civilian shipbuilding project in the UK for 30 years. The last time a vessel of similar scale was launched into the River Mersey from the Cammell Laird slipway was in 1981 when the yard built the RFA Bayleaf for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. A workforce of 900 have been working on the RRS Sir David Attenborough for the past two years. Expected to go into service in 2019, the \u0026pound200m vessel is the UK government’s largest investment in polar science since the mid 1980s.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

Margaret \u0027Mags\u0027 Murphy from Dublin, Ireland had grown concerned about lesions on her forehead - which doctors initially claimed was psoriasis. But further inspection showed that this was skin cancer, and that she would need treatment. The mum explained that she had lesions on her forehead that had been there for years but wouldn\u0027t go away. She told Dublin Live : Seven years before I was diagnosed, one dermatologist told me it was psoriasis. But then the lesions started to blister, I could feel them tingle all the time. Mags then went to her doctor in Dublin, who referred her to St James\u0027 Hospital but was told she wouldn\u0027t hear back from them for 18 months to two years.  The Dubliner wasn\u0027t in a rush about getting her lesions checked because they were hidden by her hair, so she waited the two years before going back to her doctor in 2016. Mags continued: She sent in an urgent referral and I heard back in a couple of weeks. After she finally got an appointment made with the hospital, Mags was diagnosed with pre-cancerous cells. The 47-year-old was then given a treatment called efudex, which is a type of chemotherapy you can do from home. She wasn\u0027t scared by what happened after living 13 years in Greece, adding that she wasn\u0027t surprised. Mags said: I liked the sun and my mother had been through the same treatment.  I knew it could be treated. I was able to have the cancerous cells frozen off but because of my history, they said there could be more that haven\u0027t shown up yet so they treated my whole face. Mags explained that even though the lesions on her face looked the worst, it was actually her chin that was worst affected despite having no visible signs.  Her whole body was given the treatment and she shared her journey on her blogs, Mags Murphy\u0027s Journey. She set up the blog so she could help others understand what the process was. She said: A lot of doctors can\u0027t really advice you because they haven\u0027t done the treatment I went through, so people have come to me and said the blog has helped them know that they\u0027re going through the same steps.

Aptamil has changed its First Infant milk powder in recent weeks, but parents have flooded the product\u0027s Facebook page with complaints.   They say youngsters are being sick and suffering from diarrhoea after drinking the new milk, the Manchester Evening News reported.  Some mums have shared photos of the feeds, saying the milk is curdling and the powder doesn\u0027t dissolve.  And they say Danone, which makes Aptamil and insists the new recipe is safe to drink, has given different explanations to concerned families. Sarah Foster said her eight-week-old son Tobi had been fine on the old milk since birth, but became ill after trying the new tub. She told the paper: He was sick straight away when feeding him the first feed of it. As soon as it hit his tummy it was back up. It was then I noticed it didn’t mix the same. I’ve since stockpiled the old formula but it will only last a week or two. We have no choice but to use the new one as everywhere has sold out or no longer stocks the old one.  Sarah, 35, also mum to seven-year-old Joshua, says the company is giving various responses to customers who have complained. She added: I’m so annoyed and upset about this as Aptamil are giving different answers to different people, from blaming how mums are making up the formula and then backtracking. I’ve got my replies from them through Facebook messenger and you can tell they\u0027re generic responses despite coming from a person. Parents have also complained the company has reduced the size of its packs from 900g to 800g while keeping the tubs at the same price.  Bel Garner shared a Facebook post about the new formula earlier this week and has since received more than 200 messages from people having similar issues. The experienced mum-of-three, said she was offended by the suggestion mums could be making the feeds up wrong and has criticised the new guidance to make the milk using water that\u0027s cooled for half an hour. She said: Aptamil please tell me what magical skill I have to tell my 4 1/2 old month baby that she has to wait 30 minutes for her bottle (more so if you have a baby that’s not in a routine or feeds on demand) as we are advised as parents NOT to pre-make bottles and to make each feed up as we need it and to cool down with cold water for immediate use.  Mum Susan Johnston, whose daughter was being very sick, refusing feeds and suffering with diarrhoea, posted a photo of one bottle made up with the old formula and one with the new to show the company the difference between the two. She said: The pictures I took were of Aptamil old and new formula. Why is there such a difference between the two when they were both made at same time in the same way? And another mum Amanda Higson, urged the company to take action over the number of complaints. She said: I don’t think it’s a coincidence a lot of babies are getting poorly on the new First Infant milk. Why change the formula when it was fine? I think this should be looked into as a priority, either bring the old milk back or look into why babies are reacting so badly to the new one. In the heat/weather at the moment it’s even more of a priority when babies are either not taking to the milk or being sick/upset tummy and losing fluids. Sort it Aptamil, very disappointing.

Even though they\u0027re still months away from meeting their baby, the changes to their day-to-day life start immediately. There\u0027s a whole host of foods they can no longer eat, they can\u0027t drink and they will sometimes have to give up the hobbies they love. But there\u0027s one thing Pippa Middleton, who is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews, is refusing to give up despite that growing baby bump.   Writing in her column for Waitrose Weekend , the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s little sister, 34, explains why she is still playing tennis.  She said: I\u0027ve been a tennis fan since childhood, as player and spectator, and have been keen to continue playing safely throughout pregnancy. Take Serena Williams – she famously proved that women can play a high level of tennis from two months (when she won the 2017 Australian Open) up to eight months. Few of us can relate to this elite excellence, but if you\u0027re a healthy, well-trained player with an uncomplicated pregnancy there\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t continue a good level of tennis.  It is believed Pippa is due in October. And it\u0027s not just playing which Pippa enjoys, and she\u0027s a regular at Wimbledon. She was in the crowds for day four of this year\u0027s competition with her brother James.

England will take on Sweden at 3pm today in a crucial quarter-final clash, but shops and two streets in Ashby, Leicestershire, will be shut down for the duration.  The controversial move comes after police were called in when large numbers of chanting England supporters marched down a street on Tuesday night after Gareth Southgate\u0027s side beat Colombia on penalties.    Video showed some people clambering on top of a lorry amid rowdy scenes in the town, LeicestershireLive reported.  And Leicestershire County Council says Market Street and Brook Street in the town centre will now be closed between 2pm and 6.30pm today for public safety. It is not thought that any damage was caused during Tuesday\u0027s high-spirited celebrations, but businesses are not taking any chances. Ashby town councillor and business owner John Coxon said that celebrations around the games could sometimes be intimidating. He said: I think some of the business owners are fearful of what might happen. Our neighbours have said they’re going to close early rather than risk any aggravation. People like to celebrate and it’s understandable, but for some it can be a bit intimidating. Like most market towns, businesses in Ashby can’t afford to lose 25 per cent of their trade on a Saturday.

But will England give them something to celebrate in the glorious sunshine and 33C heat? Saturday afternoon is set to be a scorcher as a record 30 million people watch the quarter final clash on TV. Temperatures could be the hottest of the year so far as football fans battle the heat as well as their nerves - but there is a risk of isolated showers in some places.  Porthmadog in Wales is the current record holder, reaching 33C exactly on June 28, but this weekend the thermometer could edge just above it. But the sweltering conditions pose a health risk, especially to vulnerable Brits including the elderly. The Met Office and Public Health England this week upgraded their heatwave alert to amber - the second highest level, below red - for western regions of England.  A yellow alert is in place for eastern regions. The alerts mean people should take precautions to avoid being struck down by heat-related illnesses. Football fans will be lighting up their barbecues, stocking their fridges with beer and gathering in huge numbers to watch the World Cup action from the Cosmos Arena in Samara, Russia.    Here at home, fans are expected to sink around 38 million pints, with supermarkets braced for a beer and food frenzy. Big screens have been set up for supporters in many cities, and street parties are planned all over England. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said temperatures in London and south east are likely to reach 31C and 32C, with isolated weather stations potentially reaching 33C on Saturday and possibly Sunday.  We could well see the hottest day of the year so far this weekend. It\u0027s only got to go to 33.1C (91.6F) and you\u0027re there, she said. The football starts at 3pm, and temperatures are set to reach their highest in the afternoon. Everywhere across the south will enjoy temperatures in the high 20s and even low 30s, but almost the entire country will be feeling the heat. It\u0027s not just in the south east, but the peak is likely to be the south east over the weekend, Ms Maxey said.  She also warned of isolated showers in London on Saturday, potentially in the afternoon. I don\u0027t suppose anybody minds. They\u0027re all going to be inside watching the football, she joked. While the hot weather is ideal for a big celebration, the continuing heatwave is causing problems for water companies, which are urging customers to curb their use to prevent potential hosepipe bans. United Utilities - which serves the North West - said it urgently needed help and support to stop a ban from coming into force, while a hosepipe ban is into its second week in Northern Ireland. The amber and yellow heatwave alerts will remain in place to the middle of next week when temperatures take a slight dip.  The elderly, young children and those with heart and lung conditions are at greater risk. Public Health England said it has seen an increase in cases of sunburn, sunstroke, heatstroke and insect bites during the two-week heatwave. It has offered the following advice to beat the heat:  Stay out of the sun. Keep your home as cool as possible - shading windows and shutting them during the day may help. Open them when it is cooler at night. Keep drinking fluids, especially water. Carry water with you when you travel. Check on family, friends or neighbours who might be at special risk - for example, an older person living on their own.  Children and pets should not be left alone in cars. Amber, or level three, is the second highest level on the heatwave scale. It is issued when the thresholds have been exceeded. A red alert, or level four, is issued when a prolonged hot spell becomes severe. At that level, illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, and not just in high-risk groups, the Met Office said.

Today is expected to top the previous hottest day record of 32C - and temperatures are going to stay high this weekend as England take on Sweden in the World Cup. Tourists and workers in London suffered through boiling conditions as they travelled home tonight as they faced temperatures of up to 35C on packed tube carriages. A signal failure at White City in west London brought chaos to the central line - with one station announcer saying he wasn\u0027t sure if the train would be waiting at the station for five minutes, five hours, or five years.  The central line consistently breaks records with temperatures peaking at 35.5C last summer - this exceeds the EU limit of 30C at which it is legal to transport cows, sheep and pigs. Trains from Paddington were also delayed due to an electricity failure and trains from Liverpool Street disrupted thanks to a points failure - causing thousands of people to wait in stations in the unberable hear. As the heatwave has raged on for nearly two weeks passengers travelling through Essex said people have fainted on trains as they travel home in 28C to 30C heat.  Some have hit out at rail firms by comparing the conditions on packed trains to a sauna with no air conditioning and barely any room to move. As the temperatures remain above average for the 12th day in the row Wimbledon fans were seen struggling as they watched on day five of the championships. Fans were seen fanning themselves and trying to cover their skin to avoid getting burnt as they tried to focus on the game. And this morning \u0027official pigeon scarer\u0027 Rufus the Hawk had to begin his daily shift at 5am on Centre Court to avoid the heat. Yesterday a West Berkshire Council bin lorry got stuck in Newbury yesterday after the road melted beneath it.  Thames Valley Police said the street had to be closed overnight to enable the damage to be assessed causing travel chaos through the town centre. Drivers have also been warned about driving in extreme temperatures over fears driving in the intense heat is almost like driving with a blood-alcohol reading. SEAT have published new information on driving in extreme temperatures, warning that people who make mistakes with their air conditioning during the intense heatwave risk lowering their driving ability.    A koi carp called \u0027Big White Fish\u0027 has even been rushed to hospital this week after getting burnt in the ongoing hot weather. Owner Pat Smythe, 70, from Burton-on-Trent noticed a big patch of red scales on his back and rushed him to the vet. Pet owners have been urged to take measures to stop their animals getting sunburn - with dogs , rabbits, cats, cows and even goldfish at risk - as the country is in the midst of its longest heatwave since 1976. Derby vet Paul Revell said: Believe it or not, fish can get sunburnt if they spend too long at the surface of a pond or lake.  There could be some relief from the heat for a brief period this weekend as some scattered showers will develop over Britain but most areas will remain dry and warm. An amber level heatwave alert has been issued for western parts of England with temperatures soaring over the next few days. London and the South East will bear the brunt of the sweltering conditions and high pressure will dominate the weather with prolonged periods of sunshine and more scorching air from the continent blocking any periods of cooler, unsettled Atlantic conditions. This has created an area of clear air above the UK, where cloud is suppressed and winds have been low to allow maximum heat to come through from the sun.  Hot conditions are expected to continue into next week. It may be sporadically cloudy and slightly fresher in the northwest at times with a little more rain or drizzle . However, for those wanting a respite from the heat, there is some hope on the horizon. More unsettled weather may start to develop later this month with occasional spells of more changeable conditions edging across the UK, particularly in the north and northwest.

And they will be hoping Gareth Southgate’s boys also put on a sizzling display to beat the \u0026shyScandinavians in our first World Cup quarter final for 12 years. A record 30 million viewers are expected to watch the clash on TV, along with 5,000 fans at the Cosmos Arena in red-hot Samara.  And the match has given retailers a \u0026pound6.5billion boost as supporters buoyed by England’s fantastic run in the competition flock to buy replica kits, booze and food. That is better then last year’s Boxing Day sales record of \u0026pound4.3billion. A study by Kellogg’s said over the course of the month-long World Cup families will splash out an average of \u0026pound237 on the tournament.  The cereal firm said: “New research reveals UK families will spend around \u0026pound6.5billion across Britain. As England goes from strength to strength in this year’s World Cup, families will splurge almost \u0026pound2.5billion on footie merchandise.” Around 38 million pints are expected to be sunk at home and in boozers, with pub takings expecting to top Christmas Eve sales, hitting around \u0026pound100million. And take-home drinks could bring in \u0026pound22million, BBPA \u0026shysupermarket and off-licence sales data indicated. \u0026shyWetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: “Christmas Eve is a busy night but an England knockout game is a different dimension. We will be very busy.”    The British Beer and Pub Association added: “The 3pm kick-off helps pubs as it is early in the day and the good weather helps trade.” Asda said it is expecting to flog 8.5 million sausages over a 48-hour period as part of its Operation It’s Coming Home. It said: “Operation It’s Coming Home has been brewing for a while. We’re prepared, the England boys are prepared, \u0026shyhopefully our customers are prepared… it’s coming home.” Tesco is expected to sell four million burgers, 3.5 million sausages, 50 million bottles of beer and a million bottles of wine.  Kantar Worldpanel strategic insight director Matt Botham said: “We’re looking at an extra four million trips to the shops on Friday and Saturday. Retailers need to make sure they’re prepared for the extra \u0026shyfootfall on a stock and staffing level. “Long queues and empty shelves just before kick-off will not go down well with shoppers. “Alcohol will be the big winner. We’d expect sales to go up by a whopping 25% and over 30% of the extra shopping trips made would include alcohol in some format.”  Sainsbury’s, M\u0026ampS and Iceland were also braced for a beer and food frenzy in the run up to the kick-off today. Morrison’s has slashed the price of Piper Heidsieck champagne from \u0026pound30 to \u0026pound19.66 in honour of our World Cup winning team. But stores in London’s Oxford Street are expecting a significant downturn in trade as the high streets empty ahead of kick-off.

At least five people have required hospital treatment , including a 20-year-old Canadian tourist thought to have suffered a gore injury in the leg, after the first run yesterday in the northern Spanish city of Pamplona.  Hospital chiefs confirmed the initial injury toll moments after the opening run, which was complicated by overnight rain which made the streets more slippery. Two of the six fighting bulls became separated from the pack at the start of the half-mile course along the cobbled streets of Pamplona’s Old Town.   The animals completed the run in just over two and a half minutes, despite a pile-up in the tunnel leading into the bull ring at the end of the course where a runner fell and several people behind him crashed into him and ended up on the ground.  The San Fermin festival kicked off on Friday at midday as thousands of cheering revellers filled Pamplona\u0027s main square to watch the traditional ‘chupinazo’ firecracker being set off to official begin the event. Wearing the traditional white T-shirts and trousers, the crowd cheered and chanted while waiting for the “chupinazo”, which is in the shape of a rocket, to be fired into the sky at midday. They then tied red handkerchiefs around their necks celebrating the start of the week-long fiesta. Revellers were quickly soaked in sangria as the event, which draws tourists from around the world, got underway. On Saturday, the second day of the festival, Red Cross spokesman Jose Aldaba said ambulances were taking the injured to a nearby hospital minutes after the race in the northern Spanish city began. Saturday\u0027s bulls each weighed between 1,100lb and 1,400lb. The eight morning runs, which are called encierros in Spanish, form the highlight of the nine-day festival.   Model boat takes on swan at same lake where \u0027crazed\u0027 bird caused \u0026pound120,000 worth of damage  Most revellers party all day - and often all night - with many getting little sleep and sometimes none at all before watching the 8am encierros behind the safety of wooden barriers. During the runs, bulls chase runners through the streets over a stretch of 800 metres (half a mile). This year organizers have introduced an app dubbed an ‘anti-rape’ app to reassure women the event is safe. It follows boycott calls following a brutal gang sex attack which took place two years ago and enables festival goers to tell police at the touch of a button if they see or experience problems. In April, five men who called themselves The Wolf Pack were controversially cleared of raping an 18-year-old woman at the event in 2016 and convicted of the lesser crime of sexual abuse.

And in a sense they are – although that loved one is their former home, now a heap of rubble piled next to the devastated al-Nuri mosque in Mosul’s once-beautiful old town. They weep when they see it and they are not alone. Down the road, another man cries beside his wrecked house. The Yosifs’ explanation for coming is simple: “Because there is nothing better than home.”  We meet them in Iraq’s second-biggest city a year on from its liberation from Is\u0026shy\u0026shylamic State’s three-year occupation. This was the brutal jihadis’ last bastion – the place where their leader proclaimed his caliphate in the mosque. IS clung on bitterly as Iraqi and Kurdish forces and coalition air strikes blasted Mosul to powdery oblivion. An estimated 40,000 lives were lost 70% of the city was destroyed.  In the old town, skeletal remains of homes sag above our heads, their once-hidden innards twisted and exposed like those of the corpses that still rot within. Endless piles of stone are churned with rem\u0026shy\u0026shynants of family life – a rug, a basket, a child’s shoe perhaps lost mid-flight. As the battle raged for three months, the Yosifs hid with 53 others in an ancient cave. There was no light they ate only wheat with water snatched perilously from the mosque’s well. There was no space to lie down, no toilet.  Mum Hiam, 43, was pregnant. Her beautiful daughters Ahlaa, nine, and Masra, eight, were terrified of the dark. She recalls: “We lost weight, our skin was scaly and itchy. It smelt terrible. The bombs fell and finally we could not breathe for dust. IS wanted the cave but we refused. They threatened to burn us. But we had no hope anyway.” Finally forced out into the bombs and bullets days before liberation, they wept with relief when they saw Iraqi soldiers. In a refugee camp weeks later, Hiam gave birth to daughter Ellen. She weighed just 1kg.  Her face terribly aged, she says: “She was fighting for life.” Incredibly, Ellen won that battle. The family now rent a half-built house in the east of the city. Their only surviving possession, discovered in the rubble, is a wardrobe. Hiam smiles: “There is no money to rebuild yet we have faith we will return. We have hope now.” It is because of this fierce determination that the old town is starting to breathe again. There is no plumb\u0026shy\u0026shying, no electricity, but 130,000 have returned. In Mosul overall, 830,000 of a million displaced have come home.  Shops and cafes are reope\u0026shyning battered sofas laid out for coffee, fashion dummies and footballs for sale amid the debris. Washing lines snake between bullet-pocked walls, clothes gathering the white dust that shrouds buildings and fills your mouth. Sharmem Mohammed, 50, says: “We have no roof but we can’t afford rent elsewhere.” Grandmother Batool Khamees says the only thing that survived in her home was her bed. “Now I sleep on it even though the sun comes through the roof,” she smiles. But the area is littered with tens of thousands of IEDs. We are shown a newly discovered one and beat a hasty retreat. Water is helping people return. Oxfam repairs have brought supplies to 35,000. Children playfully suck clean water from hose pipes.  Hospitals, too, are being slowly rebuilt. Many were devastated by air strikes or IS arson. Three serve the whole city – there were once seven. At al-Khansa hos\u0026shy\u0026shypital the operating thea\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shytre is charred. It’s the only paediatric unit and its mortality rate is up 20%.

And 90% of respondents said they were happy with the overall housing service in Dundee, seven percentage points higher than the national average.Councillor Kevin Cordell, convener of Dundee City Council’s neighbourhood services committee, said: “It is essential that we know exactly how our tenants feel about the service they get and the quality of the homes they live in so that we can ensure that we meet their expectations.“When 90% of people we asked tell us that they are either very or fairly satisfied with the service they get, it is an overwhelming thumbs-up.“But that doesn’t mean we are in any way complacent. There is still room for us to improve, and that will be the focus going forward.”A total of 500 tenants from across the city were interviewed in their homes by independent market research company Knowledge Partnership.As well as asking tenants about their home and services such as repairs, the survey also explored how effective the council’s information and involvement programmes are and whether the services provided offer value for money.Jim Cochrane, chairman of Dundee Federation of Tenants’ Associations, said: “We are delighted to endorse the results of the recent tenant satisfaction survey and welcome the sustained positive trend in key areas of service provision.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f331ac10f0-940x549.jpg ","title":"a tale of seven cities dundee goes global in time for va

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"creators of famous viking centre in york to open new exhibit in tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVikings will invade the local area this summer with an exhibition featuring a 15ft boat, a skeleton and a replica ancient Nordic house being staged at Perth Museum.Vikings: Fearsome Craftsmen explores the day-to-day lives of the formidable Norse warriors and the interactive event will introduce visitors to the Viking way of life, including their craft skills.Those who attend the exhibition, which is being run by the creators of the famous Jorvik Viking Centre in York, can also enjoy seeing a 15ft replica Viking fishing boat and an ancient excavated Viking skeleton.Helen Smout, chief executive of Culture Perth and Kinross, urged residents and visitors to “seize the opportunity” to experience what she feels will be a “hit” summer event.She said: “The team at Perth Museum and Art Gallery and across Culture Perth and Kinross have braced ourselves for a very welcome Viking invasion.“The Jorvik Viking Centre is a fantastic step into another time and we are delighted to be hosting an interactive exhibit from the same team, right here in the heart of Scotland.“We look forward to welcoming visitors who have an interest in these incredibly intelligent and creative Norse warriors, and those who are curious to learn more about them in a fun family-friendly environment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f32d41f02e.jpg ","title":"dad of three luke 34 cured of diabetes after 22 years thanks to double transplant","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA dad-of-three says he feels like a “different person” after receiving a double transplant.Luke Chapman, 34, was given a new kidney and pancreas, having suffered from type 1 diabetes for 22 years and then developed kidney disease.He said that since the operation, he has been cured of the condition – and paid tribute to the staff who treated him for more than two decades.Pancreas and kidney transplants are carried out on patients with kidney disease. In Luke’s case, the new kidney has taken over from his own, which hadn’t worked properly since he was diagnosed.In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin, a hormone that controls the blood sugar level in your body. The transplanted pancreas can make insulin and correct this type of diabetes.Luke, an electrician from Montrose, said: “I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 12. I took insulin to control that since I was diagnosed.“Unfortunately, my kidney function dropped quite badly and in 2014 I was diagnosed with kidney disease, and started dialysis in 2016.“I was put on dialysis three days a week, which was quite gruelling. The last two years, on the dialysis, it was a struggle, and started to disrupt my life.“I was still managing to work but I was tired all the time. I was limited to one litre of fluid a day, which is hard, and your diet is restricted as well. There was a large build-up of fluid in my body which is bad for your heart and puts you at risk of a heart attack.\u0026#8220I was on the waiting list for a kidney and pancreas transplant, but was taken off a couple of times, because there is strict criteria that you remain in good health.”Then, on June 2, Luke got a call at 3am telling him to get to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary as medics had found a donor – much to the relief of wife Vicky and children Luiza, 18, Finlay, six and three-year-old Frankie.He said: “In about 90% of cases with transplant, something goes wrong for some reason and the transplant doesn’t go ahead. But at 5.50pm, the doctor came and said, ‘that’s your pancreas here’.“They had harvested it first, before the kidney, but from the same donor. It’s strange because you never know if the day will come or not. It was surreal.“I’ve had diabetes for 22 years and now I’m cured. I feel like a different person. I was at the beach yesterday with my kids running around – I couldn’t have done that five weeks ago.“With keeping my full-time job I was going home and just feeling rotten and sleeping a lot. But my employer, WM Mustard \u0026amp Son Ltd has been fantastic with me.“I lost almost 10kg in three days after the operation. The new kidney needs time to be regulated by the body, so it was in overdrive, removing everything from my body.“I’m now starting to put weight back on.“I’m on about 22 tablets in the morning for various things. That will continue, but the dosage will drop after three and then six months.“But the prognosis is I can eat, drink or do what I want.“The treatment I have had from the NHS has been impeccable and the staff have been brilliant.”Luke has been told the age and sex of his donor, and will shortly be told how they died. He plans in due course to write to their family, thanking them.He added: “If anyone is thinking of signing up to be a donor, please do it. You could be saving the lives of six or seven people in the process.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

Before heading west, the young centre-half turned out for his parent club in the friendly draw at Brechin last Friday.And watching on was a scout from an English Premier League outfit who had headed north to specifically have a look at him.While that’s unlikely to lead to an immediate move to take him south, his first few appearances at Morton are likely to be monitored.Should Waddell impress, there’s still the possibility an offer for him could be forthcoming before the transfer window closes at the end of next month.It would take a substantial offer to persuade Dundee to part with him.

It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me. Obviously, the manager has a vision of the way he wants the team to play and the direction he wants to go.“It’s an exciting time ahead for the football club and I am glad to be part of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hannah nets dream job at overgate gift shop after chance meeting on way to another interview","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“I absolutely love my job so was more than happy when I got asked to be store manager.”Hannah Murdoch, 24, began working at the Little Thistle Gift shop a week after it opened its doors in October 2015.After working in retail since she was at school, Hannah got the job after a chance encounter with the shop’s owner.She said: “I was actually on my way to another job interview when I noticed the shop had opened in the Overgate.“Little gift shops like this are my favourite kind of store so I always have to go in when I see one.“After chatting to one of the owners, Kevin, he told me to hand in a CV since I was looking for a job.“I got a call from him asking me to come in for an interview and they offered me a job there and then.“I absolutely love my job and after working here for a year, I was asked to become store manager, I was so shocked but more than happy to take on the role.”The Little Thistle Gift Shop’s secret is definitely it’s superb range of gifts – and Hannah says she loves being able to talk to customers about the products.“We have a lot of suppliers that we sell in store but it is very important to that the shop stocks local, independent products.“The owners Kevin and Tracey also make some of their own products which we sell. I love being able to tell the customer that the owners actually made the gift they are buying.”When it comes to working in retail Hannah says the most important thing is how you communicate with customers.She said: “The whole concept of the shop is to give customers that personal touch.“The most important part of that is how we interact with our customers.“The first thing you learn when you start work in the shop is everything else stops when a customer comes in and they become the most important thing.“We always say the staff in here love a chat but there is nothing better than a customer saying they have had a great experience in your store.“I really enjoying being able to serve someone well as that is what they will go and tell friends and family about and recommend the store to them.“You have to be approachable when working in retail and confident and comfortable speaking to people.“Confidence is something I have had to work on throughout my career, but it is something I would urge anyone interested in retail to work on too.”Although Hannah climbed up the retail ladder through working in several shops, there are many courses on offer in Dundee.Dundee and Angus College offer several in both retail and retail management.These include Introduction to Fashion Retailing where students get hands-on experience working within the college’s gift shop.HNC Retail sees students gaining a broad knowledge of the retail industry and the skills and qualities required for a diverse range of careers.The college also offers HND Retail Management where students have the opportunity to gain work experience managing and promoting the colleges pop-up shop, Tempus.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f32bb3dac0-846x564.jpg ","title":"its just amazing joy as 95k raised to send dundee boy garvie for life saving leukaemia treatment","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA fundraiser to help send a seven-year-old Dundee boy to Italy for life-saving cancer treatment has reached its target.Garvie Winter, from Downfield, was diagnosed with leukaemia last November.Since then, the Fintry Primary pupil has undergone numerous rounds of chemotherapy, which mum Haley, 32, says have been unsuccessful.Haley also recently made an unsuccessful appeal for a bone marrow donor who could be a potential match for Garvie.After his fifth round of chemotherapy didn’t work, doctors said his only hope was to undergo groundbreaking Car T-cell therapy in Italy.The treatment involves a patient’s T cells — a type of immune system cell — being changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells.Haley launched a fundraising campaign in a bid to fund the trip for the treatment, which has now surpassed its £95,000 target.She said that it was “really exciting” news for Garvie, as preparations start for the trip.Haley said: “I wasn’t up to date with everything because we had been away.“When I saw it I couldn’t believe it – it’s just amazing. The fundraisers have all been brilliant and I can’t thank them enough.“I don’t even know what to say – it gives me goosebumps.”Haley said that Garvie is set to undergo more chemotherapy treatment next week and is waiting for marrow test results coming back, before plans can start for him to go to Italy for the treatment.Lisa Vannart, one of the people behind the campaign, broke the news late yesterday – saying “best week ever”.Laura Colligan also posted online, hailing the “amazing” fundraising efforts of locals. She said: “How amazing and outstanding the effort everyone has made to make this happen for Haley and Garvie.“The target has been smashed – the way I’m feeling, I can’t even begin to imagine how Haley is feeling. Feel like I am away to sob. #Teamgarvie – he’s going on that plane.”In an online group dedicated to the fundraising activities for Garvie, locals wished the youngster good luck for his upcoming trip and praised the work of fundraisers across the city.Angie Richardson said: “You should all be so proud of yourselves for making this happen for Garvie.”Kelly Percy added: “Brilliant news. So happy for you all – good luck wee one.”The achievement comes after more than £101,000 was raised in just over six weeks to send 30-year-old Tracey Burke for the treatment that could save her life.Tracey, from Ardler, was diagnosed with cervical cancer three years ago.Her husband Greg set up a fundraising drive on May 13 in a bid to raise cash to send her to the continent for immunotherapy, at a cost of £90,000.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"james keatings return is like a new signing for dundee united boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits having James Keatings fit again has left him feeling like he’s made 10, not nine, summer signings.A long-term groin problem meant only six of his 21 appearances in an injury-hit first year as a Tangerine were made after Csaba took over as manager in November.The 26-year-old is back fit and has been training with the rest of the squad since pre-season started a fortnight ago.And the attacker made a big impression when he came on for the final 15 minutes or so of Tuesday night’s friendly win over Brechin City at Glebe Park.It was his shot that came back off the bar and hit home defender Euan Spark before bouncing over the line for United’s second goal.Keatings went close again with another effort shortly after and Csaba has revealed he was impressed with his cameo performance.“I was very pleased with James Keatings’ performance, he showed he is a good player and can play football,” he said.“He needs more time but he is more or less a new player and I know he can be part of the squad this year.”With Craig Curran and Nicky Clark joining up, having battled back to fitness the former Hibs and Hearts faces another fight to hold down a place in the team in the coming months.And Csaba has also been pleased with the way his new front men have been fitting in.“Nicky Clark and Craig Curran and even (winger) Fraser Aird, they know where the goal is.“With Craig Curran we have a fighter up front.

That’s why we want to sort that out and have some positive dialogue with them soon.”The King’s Theatre was built in 1908 and was converted into a cinema in 1928.

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sleeperz boss says new dundee hotel is our best yet","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee\u0026#8217s new landmark hotel is gearing up to open on Monday – and the Tele has been given a sneak peek inside.Sleeperz at the railway station will welcome its first guests next week – to coincide with the official opening of the station itself – and workers are putting the final touches to the building’s 120 rooms today and across the weekend.Already looking to be fully booked for The Open, rooms at the hotel cost from £59 a night."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"orange-walk-glasgow-dozens-of-city-roads-closed-today-for-annual-boyne-parade","story":"                          A number of roads will be closed this weekend as part of the annual Orange Walk."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8023698.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Saturday 7 Jul 2018 11:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface.

first team.All of that money will be channelled back into manager Derek McInnes’ bid to bring success to Pittodrie both domestically and in Europe.AberDNA was launched in March this year and almost 5,500 fans have signed up to the initiative.The Evening Express can reveal the cash raised – with more than £1m gross taken in.Aberdeen have had a bid of around £500,000 turned down for Doncaster Rovers striker John Marquis.The Dons will have to shell out more than half-a-million to land Marquis even though Peterborough, who also had a bid rejected, are understood to be out of the race for the 26-year-old.The Reds have already splashed out £200,000 to land midfield playmaker Chris Forrester from Posh.On AberDNA, Milne, said: “Gross we have raised just over £1 million.“But there are obviously costs associated with that.“We lose 20% in VAT straight away.“There is the cost of running the team that is doing the selling job.“Then there is the cost of the products that are part of the DNA.“However, it will leave a sizeable chunk of money that will be fed into the football operation.“It will be in excess of half a million.“We would hope it would be on the right side of £600,000.”The entirely voluntary AberDNA scheme will continue to raise money to be funnelled into strengthening the team every season as the packages require monthly payments.There are four packages that come with various benefits – Premium (£18), Standard (£12), International (£18) and Under-12 (£8).Hearts run a similar scheme. Foundation of Hearts has more than 8,000 members and has raised more than £6.5 million.Hibs Supporters’ Limited has contributed £525,000 to the football budget.Milne said: “It has been a fantastic response from the fans and it just shows you the commitment out there from them.“Lots of them are buying season tickets and signing up for DNA.“It is a great initiative and will help strengthen that bond between the club and the fans.“It will enable the fans to feel that they are much more part of the club.“As time goes past that is something that can be developed even further.”Dons boss McInnes aims to strengthen his squad further before the Europa League second qualifying round first leg clash with Burnley on Thursday July 26.Doncaster’s stance is that Marquis is not for sale as he is the club’s leading scorer with40 goals in two seasons.He has two years left on his contract and sources indicate it would take a bid of close to £1m to test Doncaster’s resolve.That is likely to be far too rich for Aberdeen.McInnes has already introduced three new signings for the new campaign with Forrester, Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson and teenage midfielder Lewis Ferguson.A training compensation fee has yet to be agreed between Aberdeen and Ferguson’s former club Hamilton.The Reds have offered in excess of £100,000 while Accies are understood to value the 18-year-old at around £900,000.The matter is set to go to an SPFL tribunal with a date still to be set.Aberdeen are confident the final figure will be close to their valuation.McInnes is also in the hunt for defensive cover before the start of the season that kicks off with the Euro clash with Burnley.Aberdeen then face Rangers in a Premiership opener on August 5 that will mark the domestic debut of new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard.Milne said: “We know it is going to be a very challenging league this year.“Rangers are upping their game, Hearts have brought in a lot of new players and I have no doubt once Hibs get going there will be plenty of new players coming in there.“I do think it will be a very competitive league.“We have never had a period since Fergie left where we have effectively delivered so many second-placed finishes.“That is how close we have been for the last five years which is great testament to Derek and his backroom team and the players.“We still have the core of the players that will be part of that this coming season.“It is going to be a big challenge.”With such a competitive Premiership expected will there be recognition of that in McInnes’ budget?“Very much so,” said Milne. “Since Derek joined the club it has been part of growing the budget every year.“We have done various things over the years to help us generate additional cash.“Last year we got the Granite Club operating and this year we have the DNA membership scheme up and running.“The bulk of that additional cash we are trying to feed into the football budget.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"joy and relief as six mile part of bypass gets ready to open","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe imminent opening of a six-mile stretch of the Aberdeen bypass has been greeted with joy and relief.A new temporary road order has been published which will allow for the Balmedie to Tipperty section of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) to open in the coming weeks.The order allows contractor Aberdeen Roads Limited (ARL) to apply for a reduced speed on slip roads at nearby junctions and allow for final preparation works.Six miles of dual carriageway will be opened between Balmedie and Bridgend, as well as improvements made to the existing route between Balmedie and Blackdog.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland project manager, said: “We said we would work with ARL to open new sections of road to bring the benefits of the project to people as soon as possible and practicable.“The publication of the road order is a significant step towards opening the upgraded section of A90 between Balmedie and Tipperty.“While we will only know the exact date when final works and safety inspections are fully complete, this milestone allows the contractor to start the necessary finishing works and certainly signals we’re in the home stretch.“We expect to announce more details in due course.“As always, we thank local communities, road users and businesses from across the north-east for their patience during these works.”The opening has been welcomed by local politicians.Richard Thomson, who represents Ellon and District at Aberdeenshire Council, said: “This is very good news and a real step forward for the project. Having the remaining restrictions lifted will be a great benefit to everyone and heralds another major milestone in the overall delivery of the AWPR.”Fellow ward councillor Isobel Davidson said: “I’m delighted this section of the AWPR is near completion. While this is a much-needed project, the disruption has gone on for much longer than originally proposed so we will all be relieved when the road finally opens.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"picture gallery torry academy through the years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThis week marked the end of an era as Torry Academy closed its doors for the final time.The school opened in 1927 but is closing to merge with Kincorth Academy in a new multi-million-pound facility called Lochside Academy.The new school at Nigg is scheduled to open for the 2018-19 term in August.But before that, we scoured the school and Evening Express archives for images spanning Torry Academy’s nine decades for a special souvenir pull-out."},{"url":null,"title":"preferred option for improvements to a90 junction to go on display","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans for improvements at a busy A90 junction are to go on display to the public.Residents will be able to see the preferred option for changes to the Laurencekirk junction from July 20.Members of the public will than have two months to view the plans and give their views.Transport secretary Michael Matheson said: “Having put a number of options for the planned improvements at Laurencekirk on display last year and considered the feedback following the public exhibition, we are now able to let the public see and comment on the preferred option that has been identified for this much-needed upgrade.“I would encourage as many people as possible to attend the exhibitions in July or August or view the material online and give us their views.“All comments received will be considered as we look to publish draft Orders for the scheme next year.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"road closure for one week during works","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA city centre road is set to close for seven days while works are carried out.Bon Accord Street will shut between its junctions with Langstane Place and Union Street.The temporary closure will be in place between 7am on July 28 and 10pm on August 3.Aberdeen City Council said: “The measure is necessary to protect public safety during duct laying works by City Fibre and carriageway resurfacing works by Aberdeen City Council.”It also advised: “An alternative route is available via Union Street, Holburn Street, and Willowbank Road, or via Springbank Terrace, Crown Street, and Union Street.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services respond to underground explosion in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice and fire services are responding to a major incident in Dundee’s Greenmarket area.Local people have reported hearing a loud explosion at around 8.30am and emergency services were quick to reach the scene.A cordon has been thrown up and onlookers asked to stay well back, according to one witness.Police said buildings in the area had been evacuated as a precaution.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/Dogs-die-in-hot-cars-398x564.jpg ","title":"more than 10 people every day have called the sspca worried about dogs in hot cars","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scottish SPCA has seen a major increase in the number of calls for people concerned about dogs in hot cars.In just 16 days, between June 18 and July 4, there were 210 calls from members of the public.And over the past year the charity has seen an 80% increase in the number of calls on this issue.Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: \u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re very concerned at the number of reports we\u0026#8217re receiving about dogs being left inside cars during the hot weather.\u0026#8220Owners need to understand that it\u0026#8217s completely unacceptable to leave a dog in a vehicle in these searing temperatures, even for a short period of time with the windows down.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about. It’s amazing. You actually discover so much about yourself.\u0026#8217Author and Ardrishaig resident Kerrie Noor entertained a library full of book lovers on Wednesday June 20.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dunadd share the spoils with ardnamurchan","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:30 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The two teams in joint first position in the league shared the spoils in a hard fought match in Strontian.Dunadd went into Sunday\u0026#8217s game with high hopes of securing a win. However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"no more overnight closures at strone point","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 3:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe second of two nights of planned closure on the A83 trunk road will no longer be needed.The closures \u0026#8211 on Wednesday and Thursday July 4/5 \u0026#8211 were planned to allow resurfacing work at the Strone Point realignment project, near Inveraray.Trunk road management firm BEAR Scotland announced on Thursday afternoon that the works carried out during the Wednesday overnight closure had progressed well, and the surface course of the new carriageway has now been completed.A spokesperson added: \u0026#8216No further road closures will be required during the remainder of these improvement works with traffic management now reverting back to a two way temporary traffic light set up for the final aspects of the project.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert expects no sewage running down streets","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/07/18, 2:18 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe reason for raw sewage running down Tarbert’s streets is under investigation.On Thursday June 28,  sewage was seen bubbling up through drain covers and running along the kerbsides on Harbour  Street.The cause of the discharge is as yet unknown, but investigations are under way.A Scottish Water spokesman said: \u0026#8216Our sewer response team carried out an investigation after reports of a discharge at a surface water pipe at this location.‘This involved using CCTV cameras to try and ascertain what caused this discharge.

I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

following day I joined my fellow Conservative and Unionist councillors at the Environment Development and Infrastructure Committee.I spoke about the need to see our council become more business-friendly, welcoming and promoting competition, supporting economic growth and getting off the backs of the growing numbers of local entrepreneurs.I also pointed out the importance of promoting our growing film industry with blockbusters such as Jurassic World being filmed right here in Argyll.This industry offers huge opportunities for our local economy and should not be ignored.Later that day I travelled to Tarbert to visit and speak to local residents and businesses.It was great to see so many Islay and Jura whiskies in Tarbert\u0026#8217s Whisky West Coast

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"  The phonebox, outside the police station on Court Street, was removed by BT last Tuesday.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7859178.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"england-have-eyes-on-the-prize-as-they-look-to-continue-world-cup-journey","story":"  The Three Lions\u0026rsquo biggest football match in decades is set to bring the country to a standstill, with the quarter-final against Sweden kicking off at 3pm UK time.

The national side will be looking to qualify for their first World Cup semi-final since Italia 90, when they lost on penalties to West Germany, but will have to overcome a record of one win, two defeats and five draws in major tournaments and qualifying campaigns against the Scandinavians.  Handfuls of tickets were available just days before the game and it is unclear if suggestions of a surge in online interest in bookings will result in larger crowd numbers than at previous games such as against Tunisia, when England fans\u0026rsquo attendance was said to be the lowest for 30 years.  Skyscanner has seen an 189% surge in flight searches to Samara this week, while the Foreign Office (FCO) said there had been a 165% increase in views of its \u0026ldquoentering and leaving Russia pages.  The FCO reminded fans to follow its Be On The Ball advice to prepare well and stay safe during the tournament.  But officials in Russia have apparently not seen increases in arrivals to match the level of online searches.

The men vanished, of course - off to the pub or wherever - and it was either a neighbour or a female relative who was around. They\u0027d be offered a cup of tea and that was it.  \"Anyway, it was going on and on and the student midwife said \u0027I\u0027m getting really hungry\u0027. So we pooled our resources - the midwife and myself - and I went out and got fish suppers.  \"And we all - the poor mother-to-be, the attendants, myself - we all ate fish suppers. It was probably the best meal she had had in a long time.  \"I didn\u0027t come from a posh family, but I\u0027d never encountered poverty like that.  \"I shared with a very good friend of mine, another medical student, and when we came back from these places the drill was that we went straight back to our bedroom, put a newspaper down, stripped and started to look for the \u0027wildlife\u0027. There was everything: fleas, lice, bedbugs. That\u0027s something not seen nowadays.\"  Read more NHS 70: Has psychiatry gone from overcrowded asylums to a shortage of beds?\u0026nbsp  However, Dr Boyd laments the rise of a \"culture of blame\" in the NHS over the decades.  He said: \"There were difficulties then when I was younger, but there is a difference in attitude. Things went wrong in those days as well, of course, but they didn\u0027t have the climate of blame and fear of doing something wrong and being blamed and sued for it. That didn\u0027t exist.  \"Another disease you don\u0027t see now is polio myelitis. Now I can remember as a house physician admitting a young male psychiatrist from the local psychiatric hospital at Larbert, with acute polio myelitis. He progressed very rapidly to the extent that his respiratory muscles were affected.  \"Now in the 1930s Lord Nuffield - the \u0027Morris\u0027 of the Morris cars, and at that time a millionaire - he had gone round the hospitals in the UK presenting what was known as an \u0027iron lung\u0027. These were the old negative pressure respirators. It was like getting into a coffin - you were enclosed in there with a seal round the neck, and just your head exposed.  \"Well, Falkirk Royal had an iron lung. I had never had training in using it and I don\u0027t think any of the other staff had either. It was just there, ready for use, but it never had been used.  \"I remember that being a very traumatic experience, and the poor chap died afterwards. I had never seen a team of nurses cry before but we were all very distressed. That\u0027s one of the bad things I remember.  \"But nobody said \u0027why did this man die?\u0027. The attitude was from relatives \u0027thank you doctor for doing all you did\u0027. It was different.\"  Following his National Service in Nigeria, Dr Boyd worked at various hospitals including the Eastern General Hospital in Edinburgh, where he was based in the department of respiratory disease alongside Sir John Crofton, the famous pioneer of the \u0027Edinburgh Method\u0027 which helped eradicate tuberculosis.  \"He was a fantastic man,\" said Dr Boyd. \"He was not only a brilliant physician and researcher, but he was a very humane man.\"  Later, seeking a consultant post, Dr Boyd became the first ever consultant physician employed by the NHS in Caithness and Sutherland when he took up a post at Caithness Central Hospital in 1964.  He was tasked with setting up the region\u0027s first acute medical unit, which served a population of around 35,000-40,000 people. Besides Dr Boyd and his senior house officer, the staff consisted of one consultant surgeon, a consultant obstetrician, an anaesthetist and a GP.  Dr Boyd said: \"It was fine, but I found the isolation as a consultant hospital doctor something which worried me. I\u0027d always been in the situation where if there was problems you always had somebody to spark off - but there was nobody.  \"I began to think \u0027I\u0027m going to develop a God Almighty syndrome here\u0027, that everything I say is correct. I missed that contact, so I came back to Edinburgh in 1970.\"  The remainder of his career, until he retired from clinical work in 1988, was spent in the capital.  More recently, he has experienced the NHS as a patient - having coronary stents and a pacemaker fitted - but also through his granddaughter, who is a GP.  \"Her stories of pressure on beds - I don\u0027t remember that quite so much,\" said Dr Boyd. \"We were certainly busy and we worked long hours, but we enjoyed them. We didn\u0027t have the problem of the elderly so much though. Being 75 back then - you were really old. Being 91, as I am, that was unheard of.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-urged-to-reconsider-rejection-of-glasgow-safe-injection-room","story":"  Council leader Susan Aitken and city convener for health and social care, Mhairi Hunter, responded to the Home Office following its refusal of the policy.  It only just preceded the announcement that Scotland has the highest drug-related death rates in Europe \u0026ndash around 30 per cent are in Glasgow.  A safer drugs consumption facility (SDCF) would help tackle the problem that killed more than 200 in the city last year, its proponents believe.  The letter to Victoria Atkins MP, Under Secretary of State for Crime, stated: \u0026ldquoWe note that other countries have successfully introduced DCRs within strict legislative frameworks similar to those that operate in the UK.  The UK Government had referred to addicts travelling from Sweden to Jutland, Denmark, to use a similar clinic.  But the councillors told how the chance of people travelling to Glasgow for the facility was unlikely due to the low income and homeless demographic that would use it.  No change to the current laws concerning supply of heroin is being sought by the council.  Special training and strict protocols will be in place for staff working in the centre.  Given the rise in drug deaths, all parties in the council are supportive of the plan.  In 2017, 934 drug-related deaths were recorded in Scotland, an eight per cent increase on 2016.  The figure is going up and up every year on average since 1997, when just 200 deaths were recorded.  The overwhelming majority are related to heroin, according to the National Records of Scotland.  Ms Hunter and Ms Aitken\u0026rsquos letter added: \u0026ldquoIn terms of day to day ethical dilemmas, clinicians employed in such a service will have considerable experience of working with drug users and will operate within their existing codes of professional practice.  \u0026ldquoWe have around 30 years of experience within Glasgow of running needle exchanges, opiate replacement therapy and outreach services to drug users, and therefore a significant body of existing knowledge, experience and transferrable skills.  At a recent council meeting, Ms Hunter said: \u0026ldquo[The letter] from the Home Office was actually a lot more positive than it might have first appeared... I think the first time we\u0026rsquove seen the Home Office acknowledge the benefits of the facility."},{"url":null,"title":"chequers-talks-cabinet-agrees-to-uk-european-union-free-trade-area-for-goods","story":"  Plans have been thrashed out by ministers and Theresa May after meeting for the day at Chequers.  The Prime Minister had summoned senior ministers to decide on the UK\u0027s future relationship with Brussels.  The entire Cabinet, including ministers who are not full members but attend meetings, arrived one by one by car at Chequers on Friday morning in time for discussions to start at 10am.  In a three-page document released this evening, the agreed plans state that the ministers had \"agreed to a more developed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcomprehensive proposal for\u0026nbspthe \u0026nbspeconomic partnership. \u0026nbsp  At \u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcore of\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbspproposal is\u0026nbspthe establishment \u0026nbspby\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspUK\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspfree\u0026nbsptrade\u0026nbsparea\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspgoods,\" it read.  Under the Government\u0027s plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.  Brussels will be reluctant to consider any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a \"no deal\" Brexit.  Mrs May said she hoped the proposals would enable talks with the EU to move forward.  Going into Chequers the Prime Minister was under pressure as the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously.  But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.  The \"common rulebook\" for goods could reduce the UK\u0027s flexibility to strike trade deals with other countries, particularly the US which would want an agreement allowing its farm products, produced to different standards, into the British market.  It would also involve the UK paying \"due regard\" to European Court of Justice rulings relating to the rules Britain will share with Brussels, potentially softening the Prime Minister\u0027s red line on the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.  But the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had agreed a \"collective position\" on the future of the negotiations with the EU.  \"Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products,\" she said.  \"This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \"As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  \"We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. \"  Elements of the plan, which will be formally presented in a White Paper next week, were revealed in a three-page summary.  They include:  - The UK committing to \"ongoing harmonisation\" with EU rules on goods to ensure frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland  - A \"joint institutional framework\" would provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements, with British courts ruling on cases in Britain and EU courts in the EU but a joint committee and independent arbitration settling disputes  - A new \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a \"combined customs territory\"  - The UK would effectively impose EU tariffs at the border for goods intended for the bloc but would \"control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world\"  - Free movement of people will end, but a \"mobility framework\" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other\u0027s territories and apply to study or work  Mrs May said: \"Next week we will be publishing a White Paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \"Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.\"  Ahead of the formal announcement of the deal, Tory Brexiteers warned that Mrs May\u0027s position could be under threat if she watered down her red lines.  Leading Brexiteer David Jones, a former minister at Mr Davis\u0027s Department for Exiting the EU, said the proposed deal breached all three of Mrs May\u0027s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the ECJ.  Describing the plan as \"not very good at all\", Mr Jones told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today that it would deliver \"something less than the full Brexit we have had repeated promises of by the PM and Cabinet members\".  Andrea Jenkyns, who quite as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit, said she would be willing to help trigger a leadership contest if the deal left the UK \"one foot in, one foot out\" of the EU.  \"I am not a hypocrite,\" the Morley and Outwood MP said in an interview recorded for the BBC\u0027s Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.  \"I am standing up for the 17.4 million people who wanted these red lines and who wanted to ensure we did not have a half in-half out Brexit.\"  And Stewart Jackson, a former MP now the senior aide to the Brexit Secretary, tweeted a link to a story about a poll warning that \"Tories will lose votes if they cross Brexit red lines\"."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-defies-odds-and-secures-cabinet-deal-on-brexit-strategy","story":"  Amid talk of mass resignations, the Prime Minister performed a political high-wire act to finally agree a deal to align Britain\u0026rsquos rules with the rest of Europe on goods, including agricultural produce a move set to confound her critics and infuriate hard Brexiteers, who claimed this would make the UK a \u0026ldquovassal state of the EU.  After almost 12 hours of thrashing out the pros and cons of her proposed customs plan during a Cabinet away-day in her country retreat at Chequers, Mrs May issued a dramatic statement.  She said: \u0026ldquoToday in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU.  \u0026ldquoOur proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area, which establishes a common rule-book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  She went on: \u0026ldquoWe have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.  \u0026ldquoNext week we will be publishing a White Paper, which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \u0026ldquoNow we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve, added Mrs May, who is expected to make a Commons statement on Monday to set out in detail to MPs her proposed way forward on Brexit.  Despite talk of possible resignations by the likes of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, none had materialised.  Earlier, Nicola Sturgeon suggested how the best outcome of the Chequers summit would have been the resignation of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohard Brexiteers as this might have signalled a \u0026ldquoglimmer of hope that common sense starts to prevail.  The First Minister warned the worst outcome would be if Mrs May\u0026rsquos colleagues emerged \u0026ldquoarm in arm, saying they\u0027ve agreed, because that means there\u0027s another helping of fudge being served up.  She added if the outcome of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos marathon session was simply an agreement that satisfied the apparently irreconcilable wings of the Tory government, then the \u0026ldquodanger is\u0026hellipthat it will be dead on arrival in Brussels and we will be no further forward in reaching agreement\" with the EU27.  Over a dinner of whiskey and treacle-cured Scottish salmon, Mrs May and her senior colleagues put the finishing touches to their Cabinet deal, which some colleagues and pundits believed impossible. Talk among Brexiteers beforehand had claimed that the PM\u0026rsquos facilitated customs arrangement \u0026ndash a hybrid of the two previous options \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquonot full Brexit and that regulatory alignment with the EU on goods would prevent the UK from striking its own future trade deals.  However, perhaps in a key sign of the agreement to come, Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, broke off from a meeting of Brexiteers on Thursday night, organised by Mr Johnson at the Foreign Office, to have private talks with the PM, who sought to reassure him that under her compromise plan future trade deals would be possible. He emerged \u0026ldquocontent with her plan.  Key now will be how Brussels reacts. Earlier, Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, said that he was ready to adapt the EU27\u0027s stance in response to any changes to the UK\u0027s \"red lines\".  Meanwhile, it emerged at a meeting at London\u0026rsquos Carlton Club on Thursday night, David Cameron persuaded Mr Johnson not to resign, saying Mrs May\u0026rsquos third-way customs plan was the only one the Commons would accept.  While the PM was thrashing out her plan with colleagues at Chequers, her predecessor was watching thrashing of a sporting kind.  Mr Cameron was looking tanned and relaxed in a smart suit and sunglasses in the Royal Box at Wimbledon alongside his mother Mary and a previous Foreign Secretary, Lord Hague."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8035370.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbcs-gracie-gives-tips-to-help-aspiring-journalists-at-future-news-conference","story":"  Carrie Gracie was among top media figures who took part in the Future News Worldwide event, which was held at the Scottish Parliament.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy.

I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Saturday 7 Jul 2018 11:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765532.1530903746!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan closing private schools makes inequality worse","story":"        Pricing out middle-class will create ever-more exclusive institutions, writes John McLellan.                Class warriors of the nation rejoice: one bourgeois institution down, just 69 to go. That bastion of inequality and privilege in Central Scotland, Beaconhurst School, is no more. Cliftonhall, Lomond, St Columba’s ... we’re coming for you next.            In the face of increasing pressure on costs and fees, and the prospect of the loss of charitable rates relief in 2020-21, Beaconhurst announced a merger with Morrison’s Academy, 20 miles away in Crieff, with the hope that its Bridge of Allan campus could be maintained for its junior school pupils in a satellite operation.            But by Wednesday the game was up. The school conceded the exodus of families making their own arrangements – many would have been put off by the prospect of a 40-mile round-trip to the senior school and Dollar Academy is nearer – meant the deal was no longer viable. Beaconhurst will cease to exist and the buildings will probably be sold for development, almost certainly houses, given how quickly a nearby Cala estate sold out. Regular trains to Glasgow and Edinburgh mean Bridge of Allan and Dunblane properties go for Edinburgh prices.Beaconhurst joins Westbourne, Laurel Bank, St Denis and Cranley and, eight years ago, St Margaret’s in Edinburgh, on the list of defunct private schools and it won’t be the last if the rate of fee increases continues to outstrip earnings and closes off the option for more families. Not that independent schools ever expect much sympathy from the Scottish political establishment, but in the last academic year the sector has been subjected to sustained pressure, particularly the confirmation in December of the Scottish Government’s plan to end charitable rates relief.READ MORE: Beaconhurst school in Bridge of Allan ‘likely to close’ following mergerThe argument that the tax change only addressed an anomaly – whereby state schools did not receive rates relief and paid the full amount – was a red herring because the payment was just an accounting device in which councils effectively paid themselves from one part of their books to another.            With a bill totalling about £5m a year for the sector, the impact on fees has been estimated at between £200-£300 a year on day fees of £12,000, or about two per cent. With fee increases now running well ahead of inflation, such as the five per cent just announced at George Watson’s, by the time charitable relief disappears senior school day fees could easily be hitting £14,000. For families with two children at senior school, finding £28,000 represents a net weekly income of £538 which is just £56 below the average UK household income, according to the latest “Living Standards, Poverty and Inequality” report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies. On the reasonable presumption that the average UK family does not have two kids at private school, it’s a fair guess that to meet school fees on top of all other living costs will require a net weekly income of just over £1,000, which is into the top five percent of earnings and a gross income in the region of £70,000. Even in a wealthy city like Edinburgh where a quarter of the total school population, over 11,000 children, are privately educated, that’s a lot of families who have to be right at the top of the wages league over a long period of time for this to be sustainable.Private school critics, like Labour’s Lord George Foulkes and Green MSP Andy Wightman, will shed few tears at the prospect of more parents rejecting the private option because of cost, but far from tackling inequality it will only make it worse as the offspring of the ultra-affluent are concentrated in fewer, more exclusive institutions bankrolled by international elites.Deliberately squeezing private education through punitive taxes is also a disincentive for the schools to increase their work with the state sector, calling into question collaborative projects like the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh at George Watson’s, a joint venture with James Gillespie’s and Boroughmuir. It’s now being extended to other schools. At the same time, Edinburgh council couldn’t even build the new Boroughmuir big enough to meet its basic needs in the coming years. The list of joint projects between private and state is lengthy and benefits both, but the unfortunate lesson of last year for the independent sector is why go to the trouble when the reward is a political kicking?             READ MORE: John McLellan: A strange obsession with expensive tramsA bursary to inspireA former contributor to The Scotsman’s sports pages, the teacher, ex-Hutchesons’ Grammar depute rector, and latterly popular after-dinner-speaker, Sandy Strang died after a very short illness last year and the school has just announced the establishment of the Sandy Strang Bursary Project thanks to a donation of £100,000 from his estate.The school needs to raise a minimum of a further £300,000 to build a sustainable fund, which will be used to widen access to more pupils from less well-off backgrounds and hopes Strang’s mantra that “much is expected from those to whom much is given” will inspire the hundreds of people he influenced as a teacher to donate. I‘m in.Booty-licious route to a job            If there was one thing Sandy Strang understood, it was rigorous application, and a couple of weeks ago I wrote about the importance of university graduates understanding their degree classifications were worth less than a CV packed with extra-curricular activities and work experience. Not so at The Spectator magazine, run by this paper’s former political editor, Fraser Nelson, where a strict “no CVs” policy applies to applications for paid internships.Sandy would have appreciated the stiff set of tasks set for hopefuls, such as provide “a one-page summary on the dismal state of the German military” and “suggest three guests for a podcast discussion on the recent Slovakian crisis”. But he would have loved the demand for “socioeconomic support for any two Beyoncé lyrics”. Like, perhaps, Booty-licious?Says Nelson: “We don’t care where, when or even whether you went to university.” But what if you don’t like Beyoncé?Anyone but England\u2028And finally to Russia and this afternoon’s big game, which Cambridge football blue Strang would have relished. An English friend on business in Dublin earlier this week was treated to some World Cup wisdom from a local taxi driver bemoaning the lack of an Irish presence. “I’m supporting whoever is playing England, but don’t get me wrong I want England to win ...

The Global Firepower ranking for 2018 puts the UK military in sixth place, behind the US, Russia, China, India and France. And some experts suggest this ranking actually underestimates the capabilities of technologically advanced countries with Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), suggesting in 2014 that even China would be “out-matched qualitatively in a ‘straight fight’ with the UK in an equidistant location”. The UK is also one of only eight Nato countries that spend more than two per cent of GDP on defence.            So, it would appear that the UK punches more than its weight when it comes to military matters.            READ MORE: Stewart McDonald: Get defence of the north right or risk losing ScotlandHowever, it has now emerged that the number of Ministry of Defence jobs in Scotland fell by more than 12 per cent to 13,930 between 2012 and this year, with the SNP’s Maree Todd describing the cuts as “devastating” and adding that there was “barely a community that isn’t being hammered as the Tories grind down our armed forces [and] hollow out Scotland’s proud military past”. This, however, begs the question of what Scotland’s military would be like if it became an independent country.The Sustainable Growth Commission report says Scotland’s armed forces would number “around 12,600” on a pro-rata population share of the UK’s current strength, with a further civilian defence staff of less than 700. So it would appear from these two sets of figures that, despite the reduction in numbers, Scotland still has a slightly higher number of armed forces’ jobs than it would have on a pro-rata basis.Of course, as the SNP rightly points out, Scotland has a long military history and could choose to increase the number of defence jobs if it became independent.            But the Growth Commission report also forecasts several years of tough public spending choices after independence – described as “austerity” by Labour – until Scotland could catch up with the better economic performance of small countries like Denmark, New Zealand, North and Ireland.So, in those circumstances, would the public be willing to maintain an military that enables Scotland to also punch significantly above its weight? It seems unlikely.READ MORE: Scottish Government raises alarm over military bases in Scotland"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765599.1530953540!/image/image.jpg","title":"almost 2 000 scottish mod jobs have gone","story":"        The SNP yesterday condemned UK government defence cuts after official figures revealed almost 2,000 Ministry of Defence (MoD) jobs have gone from Scotland in the past six years.                Figures disclosed in an answer to a SNP freedom of information request disclosed that there has been a 12.3 per cent reduction in the MOD headcount north of the Border.            According to the data ,there were 15,880 military and civilian MoD posts north of the border in April 2012.            That had fallen to 13,930 in April this year, a reduction of 1,950 – the equivalent of 12.3 per cent.The statistics, which were provided by the MoD and broken down by local authority area, showed that South Ayrshire had lost all 100 of its military posts and was left with just 20 civilian employees. Other areas to be hit hard were Edinburgh which lost 500 military jobs and Fife, which lost 520 MoD jobs in total.The SNP warned that the situation would get worse as a result of UK government plans to reduce the military footprint in Scotland. Two years ago the UK government announced that eight military sites in Scotland would close in the 16 years, cutting the defence estate by 20 per cent.The bases earmarked for closure included famous barracks such as Fort George in the Highlands, Glencorse Barracks, near Penicuik, and Redford Cavalry Barracks and Redford Infantry Barracks in Edinburgh. Others on the list were Stirling’s Meadowforth Barracks, Naval base MoD Caledonia in Rosyth, Craigiehall Barracks in Edinburgh and Forthside Barracks in Stirling.The closures, which will take place over the next few years, represent a 20 per cent cut to the Scottish defence estate. They are among 56 sites which were announced for closure across the UK.             Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said: “These are devastating figures, which reveal the extent of MoD cuts upon Scotland. There’s barely a community that isn’t being hammered, as the Tories grind down our armed forces, hollow out Scotland’s proud military past and spare little thought for local communities and the jobs that depend on the military.”Scottish Conservative MP Douglas Ross said the UK government had invested heavily in defence. He said: “The SNP have conveniently forgotten that the UK government has invested heavily in defence locations across Scotland.  “You only have to look at  RAF Lossiemouth in Moray to see that. Millions of pounds and hundreds more personnel. Hardly the bleak picture the SNP want to create. The fact is that the main threat to our military capability and the jobs that depend on it is the SNP policy of Scottish independence.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765559.1530908697!/image/image.jpg","title":"cabinet agrees plans for uk eu free trade area at chequers talks","story":"        A new UK-European Union free trade area for goods will be created under Brexit plans thrashed out by ministers at Chequers.                The proposals, agreed after Theresa May summoned senior ministers to decide on plans for the future relationship with Brussels, will see the UK agree to remain in line with the EU on rules for all goods.            But under the Government’s plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.            Brussels will be reluctant to consider any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a “no deal” Brexit.But Mrs May said she hoped the proposals would enable talks with the EU to move forward.Going into Chequers the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously.But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.The “common rulebook” for goods could reduce the UK’s flexibility to strike trade deals with other countries, particularly the US which would want an agreement allowing its farm products, produced to different standards, into the British market.            It would also involve the UK paying “due regard” to European Court of Justice rulings relating to the rules Britain will share with Brussels, potentially softening the Prime Minister’s red line on the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.But the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had agreed a “collective position” on the future of the negotiations with the EU.“Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products,” she said.“This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.            “As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.“We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. “Elements of the plan, which will be formally presented in a White Paper next week, were revealed in a three-page summary.They include:- The UK committing to “ongoing harmonisation” with EU rules on goods to ensure frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland            - A “joint institutional framework” would provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements, with British courts ruling on cases in Britain and EU courts in the EU but a joint committee and independent arbitration settling disputes- A new “facilitated customs arrangement” would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a “combined customs territory”- The UK would effectively impose EU tariffs at the border for goods intended for the bloc but would “control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world”- Free movement of people will end, but a “mobility framework” will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other’s territories and apply to study or workMrs May said: “Next week we will be publishing a White Paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.“Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.”Ahead of the formal announcement of the deal, Tory Brexiteers warned that Mrs May’s position could be under threat if she watered down her red lines.Leading Brexiteer David Jones, a former minister at Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU, said the proposed deal breached all three of Mrs May’s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the ECJ.Describing the plan as “not very good at all”, Mr Jones told BBC Radio 4’s Today that it would deliver “something less than the full Brexit we have had repeated promises of by the PM and Cabinet members”.Andrea Jenkyns, who quite as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit, said she would be willing to help trigger a leadership contest if the deal left the UK “one foot in, one foot out” of the EU.“I am not a hypocrite,” the Morley and Outwood MP said in an interview recorded for the BBC’s Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.“I am standing up for the 17.4 million people who wanted these red lines and who wanted to ensure we did not have a half in-half out Brexit.”And Stewart Jackson, a former MP now the senior aide to the Brexit Secretary, tweeted a link to a story about a poll warning that “Tories will lose votes if they cross Brexit red lines”.The entire Cabinet, including ministers who are not full members but attend meetings, arrived one by one by car at Chequers on Friday morning in time for discussions to start at 10am.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “It is farcical that it has taken two years for the Cabinet to even attempt to agree a position on the basics of our future relationship with the EU.“On previous form, whatever has apparently been agreed will struggle to survive contact with Tory MPs and members.“This looks like a sticking plaster rather than the Government’s final position.“With just a matter of months of the negotiations left, Theresa May’s ability to deliver Brexit continues to be in doubt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tired old games jamie halcro johnston ","story":"Regrettably, Humza Yousaf has once again chosen to play politics and attack MSPs who have stood up for the interests of Orkney and Shetland at Holyrood while he and his SNP colleagues were trying for months to pretend that their long-standing commitment to fair funding did not exist.\nThere is little doubt that, without this issue being raised up the political agenda, the SNP would have dropped their pledge to the people of the islands like a stone. So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

in the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nSaturday 7 Jul 2018 11:44
