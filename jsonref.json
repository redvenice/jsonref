Unlike previous presidents Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, Bush treated agents with respect and consideration          President Bush (R) at wheel of golf cartout on course in Kennebunkport, ME           President George Bush on his speed boat Fidelity with (from left) Robert Gates, Secret Service agent and Curry Kirkpatrick          Neil Bush ( right) greets members of the U.S. Secret Service after the casket of former President George H. W. Bush was placed into a hearse at the George H. Lewis Funeral Home following a family service,Monday\u0027Bush is a great man, just an all-around nice person,\u0027 an agent said of the former president when he was alive. \u0027Both he and Mrs. Bush are very thoughtful, and they think outside their own little world. They think of other people.\u0027\u0027Bush understands that politics is politics and friendship is friendship,\u0027 an agent who was on his detail says. \u0027He can be friends with a lot of people who may not agree with him. The only things that bothered him were things that were important to the country. Little things just kind of seemed to roll off of him.\u0027When Bush—code-named Timberwolf—was vice president, agent William Albracht was on the midnight shift at the vice president\u0027s residence. While agents refer to the President\u0027s Protective Detail as the Show, they call the Vice President\u0027s Protective Detail the Little Show with Free Parking. That\u0027s because, unlike the White House, the vice president\u0027s residence provides parking for agents.Albracht was new to the post, and Agent Dowling filled him in.\u0027Well, Bill, every day the stewards bake the cookies, and that is their job, and that is their responsibility,\u0027 Dowling told him. \u0027And then our responsibility on midnights is to find those cookies or those left from the previous day and eat as many of them as possible.\u0027Assigned to the basement post around 3 a.m., Albracht was getting hungry.\u0027We never had permission to take food from the kitchen, but sometimes you get very hungry on midnights,\u0027 said Albracht.  \u0027I walked into the kitchen that was located in the basement and opened up the refrigerator. I\u0027m hoping that there are some leftover snacks from that day\u0027s reception, It was slim pickin\u0027s. All of a sudden, there\u0027s a voice over my shoulder.\u0027  George W. Bush playfully steps upon his father 27 January 1990 while he warms up for a run at Fort McNaire Army base while his mother Barbara  and Secret Service agents look on.  \u0027Bush understands that politics is politics and friendship is friendship,\u0027 an agent who was on his detail says          US George Bush (then, vice president) with wife Barbara and sons George (2R)  Marvin (R) and daughter Dorothy (behind Bush) and secret service man aboard Bush\u0027s cigarette boat Fidelity          President George H.W. Bush was assisted by Secret Service as he leaves the ballpark after watching the Houston Astros play the Chicago Cubs at Minute Maid Park in 2011\u0027Hey, anything good in there to eat?\u0027 the man asked.\u0027No, looks like they cleaned it out,\u0027 Albracht said.\u0027I turned around to see George Bush off my right shoulder,\u0027 Albracht said. \u0027After I get over the shock of who it was, Bush says, Hey, I was really hoping there would be something to eat. And I said, Well, sir, every day the stewards bake cookies, but every night they hide them from us.\u0027With a wink of his eye he says, Let\u0027s find \u0027em. So we tore the kitchen apart, and sure enough we did find them. He took a stack of chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk and went back up to bed, and I took a stack and a glass of milk and went back to the basement post.\u0027When Albracht returned to the post, Dowling asked, \u0027Who the hell were you in there talking to?\u0027Albracht told him what had happened. \u0027Oh yeah, sure right,\u0027 Dowling said.Agents noted the contrast between George H. W. Bush and Al Gore, one of Bush\u0027s successors as vice president. Like Hillary Clinton, Gore - who also claimed to be a champion of the \u0027little people\u0027-treated agents with disdain and told them he did not want to be bothered greeting them or seeing them.\u0027Gore told agents at his home in Carthage, Tennessee, that they should duck behind bushes when they rotated shifts because the Gores didn\u0027t want to see them,\u0027 a former agent says. \u0027I was on the detail one Christmas when Gore was at his home in Carthage,\u0027 former agent Jeff Crane says. \u0027Neighbors offered us food on Christmas Day, but the Gores never even bothered to say \u0027Merry Christmas\u0027 or \u0027Thank you.\u0027Hillary Clinton, who continues to be protected by the Secret Service as the spouse of a former president, is so nasty to her agents that being assigned to her detail is considered by agents to be a form of punishment and the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service.Like Bush, President Trump treats his agents with respect and consideration. Sitting on a sofa overlooking the main Mar-a-Lago pool four days before a recent New Year\u0027s Eve party there, I asked Trump how he likes being protected by Secret Service agents.          Hillary Clinton, who continues to be protected by the Secret Service as the spouse of a former president, is so nasty to her agents that being assigned to her detail is considered by agents to be a form of punishment and the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service  Surrounded by Secret Service agents, President George Bush waves to the crowd from his limousine after attending a ceremony honoring World War II dead in Rome\u0027It\u0027s great,\u0027 he said. \u0027I have agents all around me as I\u0027m playing golf, and they are all looking in different directions, so when I miss a shot, they don\u0027t see it!\u0027When he was vice president, Bush flew to a fund-raiser in Boise, Idaho, during the 1982 election campaign. He was to have dinner at the Chart House seafood restaurant on North Garden Street, on the banks of the Boise River.\u0027The way we protected him, we had some agents inside, but typically what we\u0027d do was situate ourselves at dining tables near him,\u0027 Dowling says.Dowling had been seated for a few minutes when he heard a radio transmission: Two white males in camouflage outfits and carrying long weapons were creeping around the back toward their location. They were crawling on their bellies, moving themselves along with their elbows.Just then, Dowling looked up and saw the two bad guys. He thought of intelligence reports that Libya had sent a hit squad to the U.S. to kill American officials. The agent instinctively jumped out of his chair and tackled Bush to protect him. Food flew everywhere as Dowling threw the vice president on the ground and flopped on top of him.\u0027What\u0027s going on here?\u0027 Bush demanded to know.\u0027I don\u0027t know, but just keep your head down,\u0027 Dowling answered.Dowling looked up. He saw dozens of law enforcement officers with their guns drawn—Secret Service agents, sheriff\u0027s department deputies, and state troopers. They were on the scene as part of routine protection for a vice presidential visit. The two bad guys were kneeling with their hands clasped behind their heads.\u0027We evacuated the VP out of the restaurant to get him away from whatever danger may have still been there,\u0027 Dowling says. \u0027You would think I had just thwarted an assassination attempt.\u0027As it turned out, the restaurant was near an apartment complex where the girlfriend of one of the two men lived.\u0027The guy had gone to see his girlfriend, and she was there with another guy,\u0027 Dowling said.          Former Washington Post and Wall Street Journal journalist Len Kessler with President Trump. at Mar-a-Lago. Kessler says the president treats his agents with respect and consideration\u0027So the boyfriend got very angry. The other guy who was there with his girlfriend pulled out a knife, kind of slashed him, didn\u0027t hurt him badly. So this fellow who had been cut decided that he and another guy were going to go back and kill the guy that night.\u0027Not knowing the vice president was coming, they parked in the lot at the Chart House and decided to sneak through the woods to get to the apartment complex. They were tried and convicted on illegal weapons and attempted assault charges.Despite warnings from his detail, Bush would insist on leaving the Oval Office through the door to the Rose Garden and greeting tourists lined up along the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue. Bush\u0027s detail leader assigned agents to rush to the fence as soon as an alarm notified them that Bush had opened the door to the outside. Soon, the Washington Post ran a story reporting that tourists were delighted at their unexpected encounter with the president. Trump warns Democrats he\u0027ll \u0027close the entire Southern...George H.W.

He pointed out to the president that by greeting people spontaneously, he was not only endangering himself but his agents. From then on, \u0027Bush would give us time to set up a secure zone at the fence,\u0027 Smith says.At one point, Bush and his wife Barbara were staying at their Kennebunkport home in the winter, and the president and his wife went out for a walk in the freezing cold.\u0027I had a hat on, and two of the other agents had a hat on, but the one agent assigned to the first lady didn\u0027t bring a hat with him,\u0027 says former agent Patrick F. Sullivan, who was on the President\u0027s Protective Detail from 1986 to 1990. \u0027So the president came out with Mrs. Bush, and we started to walk.\u0027\u0027Where\u0027s your hat?\u0027 Mrs. Bush asked the hatless agent.\u0027Oh, Mrs. Bush, I didn\u0027t bring one. I didn\u0027t realize it was going to be so cold here,\u0027 he said.\u0027George, we need to get this agent a hat,\u0027 Barbara Bush—code-named Tranquillity—said.\u0027Okay, Bar,\u0027 he replied.She walked back in the house, got one of President Bush\u0027s furry hats, and gave it to the agent.\u0027No, Mrs. Bush, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 the agent said.\u0027Hey, don\u0027t argue with Mrs. Bush,\u0027 Bush said.The agent put on the president\u0027s hat. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/14/4E65CD4900000578-0-image-m-57_1532006053384.jpg","title":"Poppi Worthingtons father claims coroner overstepped mark","story":"    Paul Worthington has repeatedly been accused of abusing the 13-month old before she was found lifeless and bleeding in his double bedPoppi Worthington\u0027s father claims a coroner \u0027overstepped the mark\u0027 when he ruled at an inquest that he probably sexually abused the toddler before her death. Paul Worthington, 50, has repeatedly been accused of abusing the 13-month old before she was found lifeless and bleeding in his double bed in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria in December 2012. In January senior coroner David Roberts ruled the \u0027fit and active\u0027 toddler was assaulted by her father - a ruling mirroring two High Court judgements in 2014 and 2016.Former supermarket worker Worthington, believed to be using Legal Aid, has now launched a judicial review of how the death was recorded as he took his case to the High Court, sitting in Manchester. Cumbria Police botched their investigation into Poppi\u0027s death, losing vital evidence about her last hours.However, at the conclusion of the inquest, senior coroner for Cumbria David Roberts ruled the child had been anally penetrated but that this did not cause her death.He concluded that Poppi suffocated as she slept next to her father in an \u0027unsafe sleeping environment\u0027.Mr Worthington\u0027s lawyers applied for a review of the coroner\u0027s record of inquest, the final two pages of his 87-page ruling, where the coroner must complete boxes in writing, detailing who and how the death occurred.

Which should not be there. It doesn\u0027t touch on how this little girl died.\u0027What is on the record and will be kept on the record, and people tend to go to, is the inquisition, is the very end document where the findings are, and that\u0027s incorrect.\u0027          Poppi was found lifeless and bleeding in her father\u0027s double bed in December 2012Pictured: Poppi Worthington\u0027s neighbour who was arrested...Share this articleHe added: \u0027It is perfectly clear this was an asphyxia death.

What\u0027s it doing in box three?\u0027Samantha Leek QC, representing the coroner, said the anal penetration was part of the \u0027wider factual matrix\u0027 giving rise to her death and Mr Thomas was trying to restrict the record of inquest to the immediate medical cause of death.She added: \u0027She came by her death because she is brought into bed, because she\u0027s brought into bed to be harmed.\u0027Where there\u0027s been a high-profile inquest, the central question of which is whether or not this little girl was anally penetrated and whether it caused her death, surely it is within the coroner\u0027s discretion to include that?

But more because the brothers have seemed so close throughout their lives. Until now, that is.    It now seems likely that William and Kate will spend Christmas not only apart from Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan, but many miles awayWith the stream of disclosures threatening to become a torrent, The Mail on Sunday understands courtiers at Kensington Palace have started a ‘mole hunt’ in an attempt to stop leaks to the media that have led to so many unfavourable reports.They have certainly not made for comfortable reading. Insiders have claimed, for example, that a rather ‘dictatorial’ Harry has been throwing his weight around, aggrieved that neither his brother nor courtiers and servants have been ‘rolling out the red carpet’ for his new American bride.It has been suggested that Meghan has been brusque with servants and that her exacting wedding preparations led Kate to burst into tears following a bridesmaid fitting for daughter Charlotte. It has been a stressful time all round, it is true. Kate has only recently given birth to her third child, Louis, while Meghan finds herself a newcomer in a foreign land – and a member of the most extraordinary family in Britain. Perhaps a few early false steps and antagonisms were to be expected.Kid Rock gets booted from his grand marshal gig at Nashville...Carole Middleton says she has stopped reading stories about...Kicking up a stink: \u0027Dictatorial\u0027 bride Meghan wanted air...Furious Duchess of Cambridge \u0027fell out with Meghan Markle...Share this articleMeghan, who has worked hard to master her new Royal brief, is well-liked not just by the public, but by her new father-in-law, Prince Charles. He admires her work ethic and shares an interest in the arts.But the MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested.As early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family. And it was in response that Charles attempted to smooth things over by engineering an invitation to Anmer Hall – William and Kate’s country home near Sandringham. He hoped it might bring the couples together.It didn’t go well. Indeed, one well-placed source says the occasion was marred by a ‘ghastly row’ between the couples – one reason there will be no repeat this Christmas. A senior Royal aide has revealed that the atmosphere at Anmer soured shortly after Harry and his then fiancee had arrived, and Meghan was judged to have been ‘downright rude’.          The MoS understands that as early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family‘Kate had a quiet word with Meghan,’ says the aide. ‘It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been “told off”.‘He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation.’Kate, it is said, already felt put upon in being asked to host Meghan and Harry. Tired and pregnant, she had been hoping for a quiet Christmas. Perhaps the strain showed.At any rate, the atmosphere was ‘poisonous’ for a while, continues the aide, and only thawed with a visit by Charles, who was told by William what had happened and did his best to jolly everyone along.This is by no means an isolated example of Meghan’s supposed high-handedness, according to chatter in Royal circles.A new book by Royal commentator Robert Jobson even claimed Harry had previously told one staff member: \u0027What Meghan wants, she gets.\u0027The MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested (pictured: Meghan and Kate at the wedding of Princess Eugenie)This newspaper has learned from one of William’s closest friends that the Prince had doubts about how suitable Meghan might be as his brother’s bride – and that he voiced them.It is understood William’s concerns reached the ears of the Queen and, more pertinently, of Harry himself. One member of William’s circle told the MoS: ‘The problem is that the Cambridges felt things had moved very quickly between Harry and Meghan. Wills particularly was worried and felt close enough to Harry to voice his thoughts.’The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brother. But few of us like it when our romantic choice is questioned – and this appears to be the case with Harry now.Royal observers are asking, too, if William fears that Meghan is in some way assuming the space occupied by his late mother Diana. A beautiful, fashion-loving Royal determined to make her mark through charitable works? The parallels are inevitable.          The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brotherKate, in contrast, has taken a less showy approach to her role. She has dutifully accepted advice on how to dress and how to deport herself as a Royal, whereas Meghan has so far seemed determined to strike out on her own – on occasion at least.It is understood that Kate has had a number of meetings over tea in which she has attempted to explain the rules of The Firm to Meghan – and that her advice didn’t go down well. Kate is said to have told friends she was very sad about what was happening and felt that Harry was ‘changing’.‘She and Harry have always had a very close relationship, but she said things were different,’ says one.

Theirs is a markedly more celebrity-driven ‘court’ than has been normal for the Royals in recent times, and quite different from the so-called Turnip Toffs who make up William and Kate’s group of friends in Norfolk.And with the celebrity associates, it seems, come celebrity anxieties.So uncomfortable have they grown with a steady stream of media disclosures, it seems that Harry and Meghan are now determined to bring them to a halt.It will be fascinating to see just what or who the Royal ‘mole-hunt’ unearths."},{"url":null,"title":"Apprentice fans clock Sir Alan Sugar wearing SEVEN different Rolexes nine episodes","story":"    Sir Alan Sugar wore a silver Rolex Daytona worth £20,000 on episode one of series 14 of The Apprentice          On episode two, the business tycoon flashed a silver and black Sky-dweller Rolex worth £20,000He also donned an 18 carat yellow gold Yacht-Master II worth £30,000 in episode five where Rick Monk was booted from the show after contestants created their own footwear brand.In one episode Lord Sugar flashed a watch, originally designed for Pan American Airways pilots, worth an impressive £90,000. The Apprentice EXCLUSIVE: Tom admits he felt \u0027relaxed\u0027 going...\u0027A load of Jackson Pollocks!\u0027 Lord Sugar\u0027s barb about the...Share this articleAnd the seven Rolexes worn throughout the latest series are estimated to have cost Lord Sugar around £230,000.Eagle-eyed viewers were quick to point out the tycoon\u0027s varied collection of expensive wrist wear throughout the series.

Lewis Funeral Home following a family service,Monday\u0027Bush is a great man, just an all-around nice person,\u0027 an agent said of the former president when he was alive. \u0027Both he and Mrs. Bush are very thoughtful, and they think outside their own little world. They think of other people.\u0027\u0027Bush understands that politics is politics and friendship is friendship,\u0027 an agent who was on his detail says. \u0027He can be friends with a lot of people who may not agree with him. The only things that bothered him were things that were important to the country. Little things just kind of seemed to roll off of him.\u0027When Bush—code-named Timberwolf—was vice president, agent William Albracht was on the midnight shift at the vice president\u0027s residence. While agents refer to the President\u0027s Protective Detail as the Show, they call the Vice President\u0027s Protective Detail the Little Show with Free Parking. That\u0027s because, unlike the White House, the vice president\u0027s residence provides parking for agents.Albracht was new to the post, and Agent Dowling filled him in.\u0027Well, Bill, every day the stewards bake the cookies, and that is their job, and that is their responsibility,\u0027 Dowling told him. \u0027And then our responsibility on midnights is to find those cookies or those left from the previous day and eat as many of them as possible.\u0027Assigned to the basement post around 3 a.m., Albracht was getting hungry.\u0027We never had permission to take food from the kitchen, but sometimes you get very hungry on midnights,\u0027 said Albracht.  \u0027I walked into the kitchen that was located in the basement and opened up the refrigerator. I\u0027m hoping that there are some leftover snacks from that day\u0027s reception, It was slim pickin\u0027s. All of a sudden, there\u0027s a voice over my shoulder.\u0027  George W.

Bush was assisted by Secret Service as he leaves the ballpark after watching the Houston Astros play the Chicago Cubs at Minute Maid Park in 2011\u0027Hey, anything good in there to eat?\u0027 the man asked.\u0027No, looks like they cleaned it out,\u0027 Albracht said.\u0027I turned around to see George Bush off my right shoulder,\u0027 Albracht said. \u0027After I get over the shock of who it was, Bush says, Hey, I was really hoping there would be something to eat. And I said, Well, sir, every day the stewards bake cookies, but every night they hide them from us.\u0027With a wink of his eye he says, Let\u0027s find \u0027em. So we tore the kitchen apart, and sure enough we did find them. He took a stack of chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk and went back up to bed, and I took a stack and a glass of milk and went back to the basement post.\u0027When Albracht returned to the post, Dowling asked, \u0027Who the hell were you in there talking to?\u0027Albracht told him what had happened. \u0027Oh yeah, sure right,\u0027 Dowling said.Agents noted the contrast between George H. W.

He was to have dinner at the Chart House seafood restaurant on North Garden Street, on the banks of the Boise River.\u0027The way we protected him, we had some agents inside, but typically what we\u0027d do was situate ourselves at dining tables near him,\u0027 Dowling says.Dowling had been seated for a few minutes when he heard a radio transmission: Two white males in camouflage outfits and carrying long weapons were creeping around the back toward their location. They were crawling on their bellies, moving themselves along with their elbows.Just then, Dowling looked up and saw the two bad guys. He thought of intelligence reports that Libya had sent a hit squad to the U.S. to kill American officials. The agent instinctively jumped out of his chair and tackled Bush to protect him. Food flew everywhere as Dowling threw the vice president on the ground and flopped on top of him.\u0027What\u0027s going on here?\u0027 Bush demanded to know.\u0027I don\u0027t know, but just keep your head down,\u0027 Dowling answered.Dowling looked up. He saw dozens of law enforcement officers with their guns drawn—Secret Service agents, sheriff\u0027s department deputies, and state troopers. They were on the scene as part of routine protection for a vice presidential visit. The two bad guys were kneeling with their hands clasped behind their heads.\u0027We evacuated the VP out of the restaurant to get him away from whatever danger may have still been there,\u0027 Dowling says. \u0027You would think I had just thwarted an assassination attempt.\u0027As it turned out, the restaurant was near an apartment complex where the girlfriend of one of the two men lived.\u0027The guy had gone to see his girlfriend, and she was there with another guy,\u0027 Dowling said.

So this fellow who had been cut decided that he and another guy were going to go back and kill the guy that night.\u0027Not knowing the vice president was coming, they parked in the lot at the Chart House and decided to sneak through the woods to get to the apartment complex. They were tried and convicted on illegal weapons and attempted assault charges.Despite warnings from his detail, Bush would insist on leaving the Oval Office through the door to the Rose Garden and greeting tourists lined up along the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue. Bush\u0027s detail leader assigned agents to rush to the fence as soon as an alarm notified them that Bush had opened the door to the outside.

He pointed out to the president that by greeting people spontaneously, he was not only endangering himself but his agents. From then on, \u0027Bush would give us time to set up a secure zone at the fence,\u0027 Smith says.At one point, Bush and his wife Barbara were staying at their Kennebunkport home in the winter, and the president and his wife went out for a walk in the freezing cold.\u0027I had a hat on, and two of the other agents had a hat on, but the one agent assigned to the first lady didn\u0027t bring a hat with him,\u0027 says former agent Patrick F.

Snowflakes fell lightly around it. A conductor stood at the open door of one of the cars. He took a large pocket watch from his vest, then looked up at my window. I put on my slippers and robe. I tiptoed downstairs and out the door.‘All Aboard,’ the conductor cried out. I ran up to him.‘Well, he said, ‘are you coming?’‘Where?’ I asked.‘Why, to the North Pole of course,’ was his answer. ‘This is a Polar Express.’I took his outstretched hand and he pulled me aboard.The train was filled with other children, all in their pyjamas and nightgowns. We sang Christmas carols and ate candies with nougat centres as white as snow. We drank hot cocoa as thick and rich as melted chocolate bars.Outside, the lights of the towns and villages flickered in the distance as the Polar Express raced northward.Soon there were no more lights to be seen. We travelled through cold, dark forests, where lean wolves roamed and white-tailed rabbits hid from our train as it thundered through the quiet wilderness.We climbed mountains so high it seemed as if we would scrape the moon. But the Polar Express never slowed down. Faster and faster we ran along, rolling over peaks and through valleys like a car on a roller coaster.The mountains turned into hills, the hills to snow-covered plains. We crossed a barren desert of ice — the Great Polar Ice Cap. Lights appeared in the distance. They looked like the light of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.‘There,’ said the conductor, ‘is the North Pole.’            \u0027We pressed through the crowd to the edge of a large, open circle. In front of us stood Santa’s sleigh\u0027The North Pole. It was a huge city standing alone at the top of the world, filled with factories where every Christmas toy was made. At first we saw no elves.‘They are gathering at the centre of the city,’ the conductor told us. ‘That is where Santa will give the first gift of Christmas.’‘Who receives the first gift?’ we all asked. The conductor answered, ‘He will choose one of you.’‘Look,’ shouted one of the children, ‘the elves.’Outside we saw hundreds of elves. As our train drew closer to the centre of the North Pole we slowed to a crawl, so crowded were the streets with Santa’s helpers. When the Polar Express could go no farther, we stopped and the conductor led us outside.We pressed through the crowd to the edge of a large, open circle. In front of us stood Santa’s sleigh. The reindeer were excited. They pranced and paced, ringing the silver sleigh bells that hung from their harnesses. It was a magical sound, like nothing I’d ever heard.Across the circle, the elves moved apart and Santa Claus appeared. The elves cheered wildly. He marched over to us and, pointing to me, said, ‘Let’s have this fellow here.’He jumped up into his sleigh. The conductor handed me up. I sat on Santa’s knee and he asked, ‘Now what would you like for Christmas?’I knew that I could have any gift I could imagine. But the thing I wanted most for Christmas was not inside Santa’s giant bag. What I wanted more than anything was one silver bell from Santa’s sleigh.            It was made into a 2004 film starring Tom Hanks, who played six parts using live-action motion capture animationWhen I asked, Santa smiled. Then he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer’s harness. The elf tossed it up to Santa. He stood, holding the bell high above him, and called out, ‘The first gift of Christmas!’A clock struck midnight as the elves roared their approval. Santa handed the bell to me, and I put it in my pocket.The conductor helped me down from the sleigh. Santa shouted out the reindeer’s names and cracked his whip. His team charged forward and climbed into the air.Santa circled once above us, then disappeared into the cold, dark, polar sky.As soon as we were back inside the Polar Express, the other children asked to see the bell. I reached into my pocket, but the only thing I felt was a hole. I had lost the silver bell from Santa Claus’s sleigh. ‘Let’s hurry outside and look for it,’ one of the children said. But the train gave a sudden lurch and started moving. We were on our way home.It broke my heart to lose the bell. When the train reached my house, I sadly left the other children. I stood at my doorway and waved goodbye. The conductor said something from the moving train, but I couldn’t hear him.‘What?’ I yelled out.He cupped his hands around his mouth.‘MERRY CHRISTMAS,’ he shouted. The Polar Express let out a loud blast from its whistle and sped away.On Christmas morning my little sister Sarah and I opened our presents. When it looked as if everything had been unwrapped, Sarah found one last small box behind the tree. It had my name on it. Inside was the silver bell!There was a note: ‘Found this on the seat of my sleigh. Fix that hole in your pocket.’ Signed ‘Mr C’.I shook the bell. It made the most beautiful sound my sister and I had ever heard. But my mother said, ‘Oh, that’s too bad.’‘Yes,’ said my father, ‘it’s broken,’When I’d shaken the bell my parents had not heard a sound.At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I’ve grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.The Polar Express by Chris Van Allsburg is published by Andersen Press at £6.99.

R. R. Tolkien, author of The Lord Of The Rings, wrote a letter to his children in the days leading up to Christmas pretending to be the REAL Father Christmas, in which he described in words and pictures what was happening at the North Pole. He introduces characters such as his accident-prone assistant Polar Bear, who sometimes writes (misspelled) comments in the letters. Here are two :Cliff House,Near the North Pole Monday, December 20, 1926  My dear boys,I am more shaky than usual this year. The North Polar Bear’s fault! It was the biggest bang in the world, and the most monstrous firework there ever has been. It turned the North Pole BLACK and shook all the stars out of place, broke the moon into four — and the Man in it fell into my back garden. He ate quite a lot of my Christmas chocolates before he said he felt better and climbed back to mend it and get the stars tidy. Then I found out that the reindeer had broken loose.They were running all over the country, breaking reins and ropes and tossing presents up in the air.They were all packed up to start, you see — yes it only happened this morning: it was a sleighload of chocolate things, which I always send to England early. I hope yours are not badly damaged.Every one of them a hero! ROBERT HARDMAN joined a hospital...Share this articleBut isn’t the North Polar Bear silly? And he isn’t a bit sorry! Of course he did it — you remember I had to move last year because of him? The tap for turning on the Rory Bory Aylis fireworks is still in the cellar of my old house. The North Polar Bear knew he must never, never touch it. I only let it off on special days like Christmas. He says he thought it was cut off since we moved.Anyway, he was nosing round the ruins this morning soon after breakfast (he hides things to eat there) and turned on all the Northern Lights for two years in one go. You have never heard or seen anything like it. I have tried to draw a picture of it but I am too shaky to do it properly and you can’t paint fizzing light can you?I think the Polar Bear has spoilt the picture rather — of course he can’t draw with those great fat paws —Rude! I can — and write without shaking.by going and putting a bit of his own about me chasing the reindeer and him laughing. He did laugh, too. So did I when I saw him trying to draw reindeer, and inking his nice white paws.Father Christmas had to hurry away and leave me to finish. He is old and gets worried when funny things happen. You would have laughed too! I think it is good of me laughing. It was a lovely firework. The reindeer will run quick to England this year. They are still frightened! . . .I must go and help pack. I don’t know what Father Christmas would do without me. He always forgets what a lot of packing I do for him . . .The Snow Man is addressing our envelopes this year. He is Father Christmas’s gardener — but we don’t get much but snowdrops and frost-ferns to grow here.He always writes in white, just with his finger . . .A merry Christmas to you from North Polar BearAnd love from Father Christmas to you all Cliff House,Near the North PoleThursday, December 21, 1933 My dears,Another Christmas! and I almost thought at one time (in November) that there would not be one this year. There would be the 25th of December, of course, but nothing from your old great-great-etc. grandfather at the North Pole.Goblins. The worst attack we have had for centuries. They have been fearfully wild and angry ever since we took all their stolen toys off them last year and dosed them with green smoke. You remember the Red Gnomes promised to clear all of them out. There was not one to be found in any hole or cave by New Year’s Day.But I said they would crop up again — in a century or so. They have not waited so long! They must have gathered their nasty friends from mountains all over the world, and been busy all the summer while we were at our sleepiest. This time we had very little warning.Soon after All Saints’ Day, Polar Bear got very restless. He now says he smelt nasty smells — but as usual he did not say anything: he says he did not want to trouble me. He really is a nice old thing, and this time he absolutely saved Christmas. He took to sleeping in the kitchen with his nose towards the cellar door, opening on the main stairway down into my big stores.One night, just about Christopher’s birthday, I woke up suddenly. There was squeaking and spluttering in the room and a nasty smell — in my own best green and purple room that I had just had done up most beautifully.I caught sight of a wicked little face at the window. Then I really was upset, for my window is high up above the cliff, and that meant there were bat-riding goblins about — which we haven’t seen since the goblin-war in 1453, that I told you about.I was only just quite awake, when a terrific din began far downstairs — in the store-cellars. It would take too long to describe, so I have tried to draw a picture of what I saw when I got down — after treading on a goblin on the mat.Only ther was more like 1,000 goblins than 15.          Tolkien even drew this illustration of Saint Nicholas(But you could hardly expect me to draw 1,000). Polar Bear was squeezing, squashing, trampling, boxing and kicking goblins skyhigh, and roaring like a zoo, and the goblins were yelling like engine whistles. He was splendid.Say no more — I enjoyed it immensely!Well, it is a long story. The trouble lasted for over a fortnight, and it began to look as if I should never be able to get my sleigh out this year. The goblins had set part of the stores on fire and captured several gnomes, who sleep down there on guard, before Polar Bear and some more gnomes came in — and killed 100 before I arrived.Even when we had put the fire out and cleared the cellars and house (I can’t think what they were doing in my room, unless they were trying to set fire to my bed) the trouble went on. The ground was black with goblins under the moon when we looked out, and they had broken up my stables and gone off with the reindeer.I had to blow my golden trumpet (which I have not done for many years) to summon all my friends. There were several battles — every night they used to attack and set fire in the stores — before we got the upper hand, and I am afraid quite a lot of my dear elves got hurt.Fortunately we have not lost much except my best string, (gold and silver) and packing papers and holly-boxes. I am very short of these: and I have been very short of messengers. Lots of my people are still away (I hope they will come back safe) chasing the goblins out of my land, those that are left alive.They have rescued all my reindeer. We are quite happy and settled again now, and feel much safer. It really will be centuries before we get another goblin-trouble.Thanks to Polar Bear and the gnomes, there can’t be very many left at all.And Father Christmas. I wish I could draw or had time to try — you have no idea what the old man can doo! Litening and fierworks and thunder of guns!Polar Bear certainly has been busy helping, and double help — but he has mixed up some of the girls’ things with the boys’ in his hurry. We hope we have got all sorted out — but if you hear of anyone getting a doll when they wanted an engine, you will know why.Actually Polar Bear tells me I am wrong — we did lose a lot of railway stuff — goblins always go for that — and what we got back was damaged and will have to be repainted. It will be a busy summer next year.Now, a merry Christmas to you all once again. I hope you will all have a very happy time and will find that I have taken notice of your letters and sent you what you wanted.I don’t think my pictures are very good this year — though I took quite a time over them (at least two minutes). Polar Bear says, ‘I don’t see that a lot of stars and pictures of goblins in your bedroom are so frightfully merry.’ Still I hope you won’t mind. It is rather good of Polar Bear kicking, really. Anyway I send lots of love.Yours ever and annuallyFather Nicholas ChristmasExtracted from Letters From Father Christmas by J. R. R.

This short, funny Christmas poem reflects her love of cats. Julia Donaldson also penned The Gruffalo and Room On The BroomI don’t know why they’re blaming me When all I did was climb a treeAnd bat a shiny silver ball.How could I know the tree would fall?And when those silly lights went outThey didn’t have to scream and shoutAnd turf me out and shut the door.Now no one loves me any more.I’m in the kitchen by myself.But wait! What’s on that high-up shelf?A lovely turkey, big and fat!How nice!

C. MooreClement Clarke Moore’s famous poem, originally entitled A Visit From St Nicholas, was first published on December 23, 1823, by a New York newspaper The Sentinel. ’Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the houseNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.          A Visit From St Nicholas has since become one of the best-known Christmas poems in the world, written by Clement Clarke MooreThe children were nestled all snug in their beds,While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.And Mamma in her ‘kerchief, and I in my cap,Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap.When out on the roof there arose such a clatter,I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.Away to the window I flew like a flash,Tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash.The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snowGave the lustre of midday to objects below,When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.With a little old driver, so lively and quick,I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came,And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:‘Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen!To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!Now dash away! Dash away!Dash away all!’As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the skySo up to the house-top the coursers they flew,with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.As I drew in my head and was turning around,Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,And he looked like a pedlar just opening his pack.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.He had a broad face and a little round belly,That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.A wink of his eye and a twist of his headSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.And laying his finger aside of his nose,And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,‘Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!’  Inside tomorrow\u0027s Daily Mail: Carols from the Wind in the Willows  "},{"url":null,"title":"Lindo Wing Kate Middleton gave birth children deemed need hygiene improvement","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, pictured attending the Royal Variety Performance in November this year.

The reality is that at no point did I get the information that I would have need to intervene and we must make sure that never happens again – and I absolutely accept responsibility for my department and myself for not asking the tough enough questions.“The reality is that a couple of weeks before this timetable was introduced, the leaders of the industry, the independent body that we set up to monitor the preparedness for the timetable change, sat in my office and said we’re fine, we’re ready – that wasn’t the case.”Grayling said the biggest mistake he made since taking over the embattled ministerial department was staring a process of reform “that was designed to be evolution not revolution.” He argued that the rail industry is currently too fragmented to deal with the pressure on it.With further timetable changes this weekend, the MPs said it was essential to establish genuinely independent oversight of the process.The change will include more than 190 additional Govia Thameslink Railway services from next Monday, trains that should have been running since May.The radical rewriting of the timetable in the spring involved almost half of all passenger services but train operators had insufficient time to prepare after delayed infrastructure work.The fallout from the timetabling debacle continues. Several UK train operators, including Northern, Great Western and TransPennine Express, have been told by Network Rail they cannot implement new timetables that are scheduled to come into effect this Sunday over fears of a repeat of the fiasco earlier this year, the Financial Times reported on Monday.The report concluded that the crisis was partly because of the “astonishing complexity” of a fragmented railway that was unable to cope with the scale of the change and described it as a “collective, system-wide failure across Network Rail, the privately owned train operating companies, the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail and Road”. The committee endorsed the conclusion of the government-commissioned Glaister review into the events, that “nobody took charge”.While Grayling had the ultimate authority to stop the implementation of the new timetable, MPs said he was not given all the information he required to make that decision.Labour’s Lilian Greenwood, who chairs the committee, said: “It is extraordinary, and totally unacceptable, that no one took charge of the situation and acted to avert the May timetabling crisis. Instead of experiencing the benefits of much-needed investment in our railways, around one in five passengers experienced intensely inconvenient and costly disruption to their daily lives.”She added: “There was extraordinary complacency about protecting the interests of passengers, who were very badly let down.”The committee recommended that oversight of national timetabling be taken away from Network Rail, to insulate the process from commercial and political pressures.Robert Nisbet of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the industry, said it was “learning the lessons” and had set up a dedicated “timetable assurance team” to assess future changes and ensure they were introduced smoothly, starting with this weekend’s revisions. He added that an additional compensation scheme had already reduced the cost of travel for season ticket holders most affected by the May debacle.Mick Cash, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: “This devastating report lays the blame clearly: the disastrous fragmentation of our railways and with Chris Grayling. Passengers deserve nothing less than his resignation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a24b6b51d3908150d8b384b2d4ebd5d59b3fad8d/0_309_3892_2334/master/3892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d00acfb092a5c739dfd5010bf31078","title":"boris nemtsov russia vladimir putin london","story":"On his visit to Russia in February 1994 Britain’s then prime minister, John Major, strayed from the customary itinerary of official meetings in Moscow and travelled 300 miles east, to Nizhny Novgorod, to see a rare success story in a struggling Russian economy. Here, in a onetime Soviet industrial backwater closed to foreigners, a young governor named Boris Nemtsov led an ambitious programme of liberal reforms, attracting investment, promoting trade and creating a new middle class of farmers and small business owners.The reforms were assisted by western money and expertise, most prominently from Britain’s know-how fund. “You are leading the way in pioneering the new economy,” Major told an audience of businesspeople at the city’s historic trade fair. “Governor Nemtsov and his colleagues are right to be proud of their achievements.”Three years later, in October 1997, another British prime minister from another party flew to Moscow to discuss trade and economic cooperation. On his arrival, before meeting President Boris Yeltsin, Tony Blair sat down for dinner with Nemtsov, who was by then Russia’s first deputy prime minister. Commenting on the talks, Blair hailed the “immensely exciting opportunity” for UK-Russia relations.In many ways, Boris Nemtsov embodied Russia’s hopes and opportunities after the fall of communism. A prominent voice for democracy in parliament, a successful regional reformer, a daring cabinet minister resolved to challenge the influence of the “oligarchs”, he was the face of a more hopeful and modern Russia. He always stood firm on his principles – whether when, as governor, he collected a million signatures against the war in Chechnya or when, as deputy premier, he required state officials to disclose their incomes and property in an effort to stamp out corruption. By the second half of the 1990s, Nemtsov was Russia’s most popular politician and widely seen as a future successor to Yeltsin.History decided otherwise. But when Vladimir Putin came to power and began to dismantle Russia’s nascent democracy, Nemtsov – unlike many of his fellow liberals – refused to accept the new rules. He became the most prominent and effective voice in opposition to Putin, exposing government corruption advocating for targeted western sanctions on human rights abusers leading protests against election fraud at home and the Kremlin’s acts of aggression abroad.He was repeatedly arrested at peaceful rallies physically attacked by pro-Kremlin groups denounced on state media as a “traitor”. But he would not relent. He was silenced the only way he could be: on 27 February 2015 Boris Nemtsov was killed, by five bullets in the back, as he walked across a bridge in the Kremlin’s shadow.Every year around that date thousands march through the streets of Moscow in remembrance. Every day, almost four years on, Russians leave flowers and light candles on the spot where Nemtsov was killed, in what has become an unofficial memorial.The official story is different. The Russian authorities continue to fight Nemtsov in death as they fought him in life. They are now fighting his memory, blocking public initiatives for a commemoration: no minute of silence in parliament no memorial sign on the bridge no plaque in his hometown of Nizhny Novgorod. On more than 80 occasions since 2015 the Moscow authorities have dispatched the police and utility services to pillage the makeshift memorial grown men in uniforms stealing flowers under the cover of darkness. It is apparently forbidden to commemorate a Russian statesman in Russia.So Nemtsov’s friends and supporters have asked elected officials in democratic countries to do what they, for now, are unable to do at home. Earlier this year, the Washington DC city council unanimously voted to designate the block in front of the Russian embassy as Boris Nemtsov Plaza. Then in May the city council in Vilnius renamed a park in front of the Russian embassy as Boris Nemtsov Square. Last month Kiev followed suit. Similar initiatives have been launched in Ottawa, Warsaw and other world capitals.The Russian embassy in London stands on Bayswater Road. Earlier this week we submitted a request to Kensington and Chelsea borough council to designate the footpath in front of the embassy as Boris Nemtsov Way. This designation would send a strong message that political assassinations are unacceptable that the legacy of Boris Nemtsov and the vision of a democratic Russia he fought for live on and that Britain stands on the side of those who are defending freedom and the rule of law. And, one day, Russia will be proud that its embassies are standing on streets named after a Russian statesman.• Vladimir Kara-Murza, a longtime colleague of Boris Nemtsov, is chairman of the Nemtsov Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2730b38aa6df914a4572e2493fa5e4f96fba7f56/0_299_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bde68b94c088bb6bc68888f3f7b9811","title":"post brexit free trade deal us rightwing thinktanks","story":"What we didn’t vote for in the EU referendum was a clutch of rightwing thinktanks seeking to capture our democracyWhat is it that hard Brexiters and Donald Trump want so much in a free trade agreement between Britain and the US that they are adamant only a complete break with the EU could achieve it, while Theresa May’s deal scuppers it? The sort of deal they have held up as the Brexit prize is contained in a blueprint published by rightwing thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs, called Plan A+. Last week it was told to remove Plan A+ from its website by the Charity Commission, for breaking rules on political campaigning. Boris Johnson, David Davis and hard-Brexit European Research Group members Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg have all lavished praise on it.The blueprint is one of a clutch of overlapping efforts to write policy that a nexus of libertarian thinktanks in both the UK and the US has been busy drawing up since the Brexit referendum. Their starting position is that membership of the EU has stifled prosperity in the UK they propose a bonfire of tariffs, quotas and anti-competitive rules.The priority areas for removing “anti-competitive” EU regulations articulated in Plan A+ are unpicking data protection rules (GDPR) introduced by the EU to ensure privacy, and allowing the free flow of data across borders, which would let big tech companies use our data – or abuse it. EU regulations that require exporters using chemicals to present safety data to the European commission before obtaining authorisation for imports are a burden on business, including the plastics sector, the thinktanks say, and should go. Likewise pharmaceuticals companies find the requirements on transparency around clinical trials onerous and should be allowed longer patents – that is, more expensive drugs for the rest of us.All services and government procurement should be opened to international competition. While these thinktanks acknowledge that opening up the NHS might be too controversial, they think it a good idea. And protections designed to avoid workers being exploited or undercut by cheap migrant labour, which, for example, limit the number of hours people can be asked to work, or require parity of pay with local workers for those posted abroad, should be removed, says Plan A+. The same goes for environmental protections, food standards and the precautionary principle that the EU favours when assessing risk.The US sees many of these rules as protectionist, Plan A+ explains. It says that in order to persuade the US to make concessions that would allow the UK’s services sector greater access to its markets, Britain will have to make concessions on standards the Americans find irksome, especially in food, agriculture and other goods. The things the US complains about and wants conceded include limits on pesticide residues and hormone-disrupting chemicals in food, nutritional labelling, the use of genetically modified organisms, the export of animal byproducts including some specified risk material for BSE, food additives such as flavourings that the EU has banned because of concerns over safety, hygiene rules including chlorine treatments on poultry and other meats, and animal-rearing standards such as the use of growth-promoting chemicals in pork and hormones in beef production.Plan A+ is most detailed on financial services after Brexit, where it suggests a wide range of deregulatory measures. Suddenly the agenda is not general at all, but very specific indeed. It reads like special pleading for particular bank, hedge fund and wealth manager interests. Proposals include reducing some of the capital requirements on banks, and lifting several controls on asset managers’ trading. The bank surcharge, which claws back some of the huge cost to the taxpayer of bailing out the sector after the 2007-08 financial crash, and was introduced to deter banks taking on riskier debt, should be cut. Controls on CFDs (contracts for difference – a form of algorithmic trading in which funds trade on the small fluctuations in asset prices without ever owning the assets) should be scrapped, as should some controls on short-selling, and caps on large fund trading volumes designed to prevent excessive swings in markets, especially in vital commodities. The EU directive on markets in financial instruments is described as burdensome to wealth managers because it requires extensive trade-tracking data to be provided to regulators. Although regulation is mostly inimical to free markets, the US will want stronger intellectual property rights regulation to encourage venture capital.The lead author of Plan A+ is a former Washington lobbyist and trade lawyer, Shanker Singham. This is the second time his reports have fallen foul of the Charity Commission over overt political activity, which is not permitted when organisations claim charitable status. Another thinktank, the Legatum Institute, was instructed to remove a previous report he’d written in a similar vein from its website earlier this year.Plan A+ followed on from the Ideal US-UK free trade agreement, a draft legislative agreement drawn up by the US-based Cato Institute and the new UK Initiative for Free Trade (which includes among its supporters Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Liam Fox), as well as nine other rightwing thinktanks. The thinktanks, bar one, belong to the libertarian Atlas network, which describes itself as a partnership connecting free-market organisations around the world “to the ideas and resources needed to advance the cause of liberty”.Their personnel overlap, as do their funders, in so far as they are known. Most are not revealed. They say their funding does not influence their thinking. But we know enough about their donors to see plutocratic and corporate interests at work. US billionaires’ trusts, big oil, big food, tobacco and tax havens are among those identified as givers by the .This push for ultra-free trade looks like shock doctrine, the exploitation of a crisis to push through highly controversial policies while everyone is too distracted to fight them off. What unites these interests is an antipathy towards the EU’s ability to rein in their power. The target is the EU that signs up to climate agreements, is prepared to consider a financial transaction tax, is chasing down corporate tax dodgers, challenging monopoly control, and is a threat to tech giants, hedge funds, wealth managers and fossil fuel barons – especially in the US. In the UK, we have been so worried about Russian interference in our elections that we are in danger of missing the source of money nearer home.This is not what people voted for, or even realised they were being asked to vote for in the referendum. But that’s the trouble with shadow political power structures.

I don’t know if many listeners realised it’s about women being harassed’Happy Hour started off as a song called French England, years before I formed the Housemartins. I was working in a ledger office in Surrey, and as a northerner I saw that whole area as part of France. So the original first line was “French England, what a good place to be”.Then I started listing things that annoyed me about the office. At lunchtime, the sales reps would come in with their smiles and all the gel and shit on their hair. “Coming down the hatch lunchtime, Paul? Coupla birds in the George and Dragon …” Which I could not stand, because I’d moved down from Sheffield, where we didn’t talk about women like that. When I formed the band in Hull, much of this stuff made it into Happy Hour.We wrote it in my house in Grafton Street on Wednesday 22 January 1986 – I know the date because I kept a diary. Flag Day had got to No 10 in John Peel’s Festive 50 and we’d landed a Peel session so needed some more songs, and along came Happy Hour. As a song it contains one of my main themes – shovelling too many words in – but it worked.On Tuesday 3 June it was at No 58. Then it just kept rising. I didn’t know that my life would never be the same again. When we did TV shows I thought it would be the first and last time so I pestered the other acts for autographs. I got Paul McCartney’s at Razzmatazz and Bill Oddie’s in BBC reception after we did Top of the Pops.Happy hours were big then – a golden hour of cheap drinking which would encourage stupidity – and something just connected. I don’t know if many people realised that the song was about feeling miserable in a happy hour, or that the lyrics make loose statements about women being harassed. After the song became a hit, I started getting letters from pub landlords saying: “Your song smashed up my pub! As soon as it came on the jukebox people started jumping on the tables. Then everybody started dancing and the tables all collapsed.”Paul’s house in Grafton Street was like student digs. We’d meet there and have a slice of toast. Paul had his lyrics in a little notebook and I had chord progressions in mine, and we’d put them together to write songs. We’d just written Me and the Farmer and I wanted to go for a “bun run” – a trip to the local cake shop. But Paul was adamant that we needed one more song, so we came up with Happy Hour. I was so desperate to get to the cake shop that I used the same chords for the chorus in the verse, but because Paul sang a different melody over it and I did the “It’s happy hour again” backing vocals, it worked. We recorded it on a little cassette recorder, I chucked down my guitar and ran for a custard slice. The whole thing can’t have taken us much more than 10 minutes. I certainly never thought: “This is going to be a massive hit.”The idea for the video came to us in the pub. I loved Morph, the little animated clay character on Tony Hart’s TV show, Take Hart, so we got some student animators to make plasticine animations of all four Housemartins. We shot the pub scene in the Star in St John’s Wood in London. It starred Phill Jupitus, who was our road manager and support act for a while. The girl in the video is Wendy May, who was a mate of ours from a bluegrass band called the Boothill Foot Tappers. Everything felt very low-key and modest. We were the self-proclaimed “fourth best band in Hull”, big in our own little world of John Peel and NME, but then Happy Hour just took off.I’m constantly amazed and humbled that people still listen to it after 32 years. I write kids’ books now and work in schools engaging primary school children in reading and writing. Sometimes I joke with them, “Hey, I used to be a pop star! Who believes me?” They never do, until the teacher shows them the Happy Hour video and they all go: “Oh my God. It’s true!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28fb8b94ddebe668a279829986bd0754c03af349/0_176_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=318f48b259a4f84e6ba09c367259e17c","title":"what went wrong with the netflix marvel bromance","story":"The streaming giant has pulled the plug on Daredevil, shortly after giving Luke Cage and Iron Fist the chop. Is the age of the superhero over?Musicians, actors, crimefighters, they should all follow the same advice: get a trade. Something to fall back on. You know, just in case you don’t make the big time, or Netflix cancels your series.Let’s not worry, then, about Matt Murdock now that the streaming giant has pulled the plug on Daredevil after three solid, if unspectacular, seasons. While his days getting his hands dirty in Hell’s Kitchen might now have been drawn to an end, hopefully the not-really-blind martial artist can get back to his day job: practising law.Given the news in October that Murdock’s partners in crime-fighting, fellow Defenders Luke Cage and Iron Fist, were also getting the (karate) chop, perhaps the writing was on the wall. If it was, however, it wasn’t visible to Daredevil’s writing staff, who were, according to one of the writers, mid-meeting, throwing about ideas for the fourth season when they got news of the cancellation. While I probably don’t want to sit through another 13 hours of Daredevil doing what should really take him only six, it would be interesting to know what they had in store.There’s no news as yet on the fourth Defender, Jessica Jones, or The Punisher, breakout star of Daredevil’s second run, but with both due to return to our screens next year – Jones’s third season started filming in June, and the second series of The Punisher is nearing completion – it seems unlikely that Netflix would leave them unaired. It’s also just as unlikely these two would be singled out for a stay of execution, especially given what a slog Jones’s second season was. Expect announcements in the near future, but good luck to anyone who has to tell Jon Bernthal he can’t play Frank Castle any more. Email might be best with that one.So why the cancellations? Quality could be one reason. Executives might have had enough of fair-to-middling superhero adventures that cost a fortune to make. Daredevil’s recent third series served up more of the expected blend of staggering fight scenes – Murdock and Bullseye’s stationery-based face off was thrilling – while Kingpin once again proved to be Marvel’s best on-screen baddie, even if he had to negotiate boring dialogue and a stagnant plot.Iron Fist was mostly terrible, even if the second run was an improvement on the first, and Luke Cage managed to make a show about a bulletproof man, who was also superhumanly strong, deathly dull. Viewing figures – not something Netflix is very forthcoming with – aren’t available, but reports suggest the numbers were down from one series to the next. The Defenders, the small-screen Avengers, if you will, apparently saw figures drop with each episode.It’s not quality and figures that seem to be at the heart of these cancellations, but business. Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, makers of these series, is launching its own streaming service, called Disney+, and it’s highly unlikely it wants valuable characters fighting crime on another service.Marvel waved goodbye to Daredevil with a message saying it “looks forward to more adventures with the Man without Fear in the future”, hinting that there could be a life beyond Netflix – a big-screen reboot, perhaps? – although Disney’s family-friendly image would probably stop it just continuing the grisly series as it is, while Netflix still owns the streaming rights to these axed characters, and will indeed keep the series on its platform for the foreseeable future. How smart a move that is, however, will reveal itself in due course. Netflix’s Marvel series are all heavily stylised and feature consistent branding. As its collaborator becomes a competitor, does it really want to carry what is essentially an advert for not just a rival streaming service, but the company that is probably going to withdraw most of its content from Netflix?If you’re worried where your next superhero series is coming from, fear not. Neither firm is going to go without, with Netflix launching its own universe in collaboration with Mark Millar, and Disney+ reportedly planning live-action TV shows featuring Loki, Scarlett Witch, the Winter Soldier and any of its other MCU characters it doesn’t think warrant a whole film. There’ll also be a raft of animated Marvel content.The age of the superhero is far from over. Perhaps Matt Murdock won’t need to go back to the day job just yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e646f90415b96e69ec1efb79f8446d48b5f8cb/1_0_3111_1867/master/3111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=202f60d07ae44dcf63f8b3e5d9b0f1b8","title":"christmas presents children chosen by teachers","story":"Anastasia Boreham, deputy head of Maryland primary school in east London, recommends a light prism (£8.99) for children under three: “This enables children to study colour and light by making light patterns on the wall. Even babies and infants will enjoy this.”Kevin Badham, early years educator at Happy Hares nursery and pre-school in Barnstaple, Devon, recommends That’s not my Kitten by Fiona Watt (£6.15), and other titles in this series: “They are perfect for helping little ones to learn first words and explore textures.”He also suggests the Orchard Toys board game Smelly Wellies (£7.75), which is aimed at children aged two to six. By turning over funny pictures of smelly wellies, players find matching pairs to put on some silly-looking monsters’ feet. “It’s an engaging game that can help children to develop memory and pattern recognition,” says Badham.The Doorbell House by Melissa and Doug (£19.99) for three- to five year-olds is a favourite of Michaela Ledsham’s, early years teacher at Sturton Le Steeple Church of England primary school in Nottinghamshire. “This lovely wooden house has a doorbell and key lock entry for the four doors with each lock using a different key. The wooden doll family stored inside provide lots of opportunities to develop children’s communication, language and imaginative role-play.”She also likes Ruby’s Worry by Tom Percival (£6.15), which delicately explores how one girl deals with her worry. “The book sensitively encourages children to talk about the things that concern them with the notion that a problem shared is a problem halved.”Badham, meanwhile, is full of praise for Giraffes Can’t Dance (£6.15) by Giles Andreae, a book about a giraffe who is told he can’t dance but soon discovers he can. This “heartwarming message”, Badham says, encourages pre-school children to have confidence and self-belief.Last, but not least, he recommends good old-fashioned Play-Doh for fuelling young children’s imagination and developing their physical skills (£2.80 for a pack of four tubs).Boreham is bursting with ideas for children of this age group: “A head torch to explore places in the dark. A glow in the dark chart of the stars to gaze at in bed and study the night sky. Any packet of seeds. If you have no garden, grow the seeds in pots on the windowsill. A notepad and coloured pencils or crayons – anything to encourage drawing, writing and creative expression – at any age. A tape measure to measure anything and everything. A ball.“A disposable camera: you take pictures and never know what image will come back when they are printed. A magnifying glass to study things.” Finally, she recommends a digital microscope (£17.99). “Put anything under it – eggs, skin, clothes, money, leaves, petals, insects, fur – and you’re amazed at what you will see. We have endless fun with this game in class.”Megan Perryman, a year 1 teacher at London Fields primary school in Hackney, east London, recommends dolls for both boys and girls. “Dolls can be underrated as an educational toy but they perform an important role in encouraging children to role-play adult-child relationships, developing their understanding of the world and building empathy and oracy skills.” She particularly likes the Fairtrade cotton boy and girl dolls from oneworldshop (£14), which come in a wide range of ethnicities.Amy Tisi, a teacher at Beechwood primary in Woodley, Berkshire, is another fan of board games from Orchard Toys for three- to seven-year-olds. “Our favourites are Shopping List (£7.75) and Tummy Ache (£10) but we haven’t found a bad one so far. The games are colourful, engaging and many are linked to literacy or maths as well as teaching the social skill of taking turns.”Perryman believes Michael Rosen’s Sad Book (£6.15) is an important one to have in any home. “It tackles the difficult issue of bereavement but is relevant to all children, showing them that sometimes we all get sad.” She also likes Dogs Don’t Do Ballet by Anna Kemp (£6.15): “This lively picture book is great for introducing children to the idea that stereotypes shouldn’t hold them back.”James Walker, year 6 teacher at Knowle Park primary school in Bristol, is a fan of the award-winning children’s author Christopher Edge, who is a former English teacher. His books The Many Worlds of Albie Bright, The Jamie Drake Equation and the Infinite Lives of Maisie Day (all £6.15) should be at the top of any Christmas list for seven- to 11-year-olds, Walker believes, because they impart complex knowledge about physics and other science subjects in a fun adventure story.Clover Colquhoun, history teacher at Highams Park academy trust in Essex, recommends the page-a-day calendars for 11- to 14-year-olds. “For example, ones showing an artistic masterpiece a day or place to see in the world – something to get the young person dreaming and improving their cultural capital.”Katharine Birbalsingh, head of the Michaela Community School in Wembley, London, likes the Classic Starts series for young teens. “The books give children an introduction to the classics. It is a great gift for early secondary school because these are texts they will come across later in school. If they have already met them in an easier format, that will build their confidence when they meet the texts for real.”Nick Pauro, assistant headteacher at All Saints secondary school in Dagenham, thinks all 14- to 16-year-olds should be given a copy of Usborne’s Politics for Beginners, by Alex Frith (£8.79), this Christmas. “This brilliant pictorial guide sums up global history and politics from Ancient Rome to the United Nations in a memorable, engaging way.” He also extols the virtues of a swivel globe (£15.99) for plotting future journeys and learning capital cities.Helena Brothwell, principal at Queen Elizabeth Academy in Mansfield, thinks a chess set (£5-plus) is a superb gift for young people approaching their GCSEs. “Contrary to what you might think, teens love stuff like this. Plus it’s massively underrated, loads of fun, and a good way to encourage teenagers to put down their phones and spend some quality time with family members.”Gill Ward, senior librarian at Fortismere School in north London, thinks Killer T by Robert Muchamore (£11.43) is a book that will appeal to even the most reluctant teenage reader. “It’s a fast-paced dystopian epic, which has a bit of violence and sex in it – teens love that, and it teaches them empathy.”Georgina Durrant, a qualified Senco and a private SEN tutor in Cheshire, says dinosaur counters are an excellent gift for children with special needs. “They are fantastic for learning to count, group and even model basic addition and subtraction.” She particularly likes the tub of 60 counters from Learning Resources (£21). “If you’re wanting to tempt a child to have a go at counting and grouping, the sheer volume of dinosaurs in the tub is enough to persuade even the most reluctant.”Jo Moore, a reception teacher at Snettisham primary school, Norfolk, says all children will enjoy learning to code Botley the Coding Robot (£59) to move along a track moving obstacles. “I have a child in my class who does not have any speech. For her, coding Botley was a fully inclusive activity as it was so hands-on and active. She could show everyone which way she thought Botley needed to go by showing the cards or the arrows on the remote.”Caireen Sutherland, an advisory teacher for vision impairment with Peterborough council, recommends a new version of the game Connect 4 (£22.20) for visually impaired families, which is available from the RNIB website. “The game has been modified so the coloured counters are distinctly different. The red counters have holes in the middle and the yellow ones are solid, so you’ll always know which counters are yours. The game is fun and puts the child’s strategy skills to the test.”She also likes the RNIB’s Braille Dots tactile Christmas stickers (£5.94), describing them as “festive, colourful and tactile”.

We are seeing children supposedly going off to be home educated where it seems quite unlikely that parents are really fully equipped to home educate.”In its annual report, to be published later on Tuesday, Ofsted also found that 4,050 with children special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) received no support in 2017, despite being given an education, health and care (EHC) plan.The Department for Education claimed that more recent figure show an improvement. But Spielman said this was still too high.She told Today: “We still have a long way to go to making sure that every child who needs help is getting the right kind of support and promptly.”Spielman said provision for SEND pupils was “still pretty disappointing”. The annual report found “worrying” gaps in provision across the country.Spielman said: “A lot of this is about the joining up of education, health and care. It is still not happening as well as it should.”The problem of illegal off-rolling pupils appears to be most acute in London. Ofsted identified 300 out of 2,900 schools that lost pupils between years 10 and 11 as having particularly high levels of movement.A spokeswoman for Ofsted said the practice occurred when school leaders “lost sight of their core purpose and put the school’s interest ahead of the child’s”.Ofsted said it would use its data to prioritise which schools to inspect, adding that its new education inspection framework for September 2019 will make it easier to reward schools for good work and shift the focus away from performance measures in isolation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

The first two changes were greeted with consensus approval the second, however, with derision, since the implicit suggestion was that lucrative films aren’t good enough to simply be nominated for best picture, that something central distinguishes movies that perform at the box office from “high art”.Thankfully, after making a royal mess of its roll-out, the Academy scrapped the popular film award. And the likely presence at the ceremony of films like Black Panther, A Star is Born and Mary Poppins Returns will ensure it isn’t entirely starved of movies beloved by large, cinema-going swaths of the body politic. But perhaps these pre-emptive measures to stave off the Oscars’ impending obsolescence – neither the Golden Globes or even the Super Bowl, after all, are the monocultural events they used to be – are misguided. Could the Oscars be saved by simply picking a good host?The Academy announced in September 2017 that Jimmy Kimmel would be returning to host the 2018 awards, one year after he did his best to mitigate the chaos caused by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway’s epic blunder (which, though unfortunate for the utterly deserving cast of Moonlight, illustrated the indispensability of spontaneous live-television snafus). But now it’s December and the Academy has still yet to announce a host for February’s ceremony, set to air on Kimmel’s home network, ABC.They could very well go for a hat-trick and give the job to the late-night host yet again, but that would be a rather safe and uncontroversial pick, which runs counter to the prevailing dogma that what the Academy needs is a jolt of energy, a kind of facelift. Ellen, one of the most admired and agreeable people in television, presided over the best-viewed Oscars telecast of the last decade, when the 2014 ceremony brought in almost 44 million viewers. But with the general currents pointing away from marquee event-television, it’s hard to say she’d provide the 2019 ceremony with an equivalent boost. So, in the spirit of the American pastime that is offering unsolicited opinions about the Oscars, some recommendations for the Academy as it presumably considers its 2019 master of ceremonies.The bright spot in last year’s otherwise exhaustive Oscars telecast was, of course, the comic duo of Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph, who announced the awards for documentary and live-action short in an extended gag that skewered the ceremony’s overwhelming whiteness. The pair waltzed on to the stage at the Dolby Theatre with their high heels in hand, lampooning the sheer endlessness of awards season and supplying the ceremony with a much-needed trickle of self-mockery. Given Haddish’s meteoric ascent since her delightful turn in Girls Trip, and the duo’s undeniable comic camaraderie, they’d be an unassailable choice to host. The comments section below a YouTube clip of their 2018 appearance seems to bolster that assertion. “Please let them host next year,” reads the first. “I would actually watch it.”The last time the Academy chose two hosts was 2011, when its bet on an influx of energy from Young Hollywood in the form of Anne Hathaway and James Franco failed miserably. The pair were fundamentally and amusingly mismatched, their comic and temperamental sensibilities in diametric opposition. It made for an awkward evening. That would not be a problem were the Academy to go with Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, whose tongue-in-cheek rapport has worked to brilliant effect both live and on their sketch-comedy show Key \u0026amp Peele. That Peele took home the original screenplay award for Get Out in 2018 would lend the ceremony a sense of continuity, or perhaps a rush of new viewers, and remind them of his comic origins.Any highlight reel of the best awards show moments from years past would disproportionately feature comic-laureate Kirsten Wiig, whose gags at the 2013, 2015, and 2017 Golden Globes, alongside Will Ferrell, Bill Hader and Steve Carrell, respectively, were welcome departures from the monotony of Hollywood self-aggrandizement (not to mention Wiig and her Bridesmaid’s costars’ Martin Scorsese drinking game at the 2012 SAGs, a rare, improvisatory awards show triumph). Wiig’s comedy is sharp, goofy, playful and dexterous, which would fit the bill for a ceremony that asks a lot of its hosts, from opening monologues to live stunts to elaborate dance numbers. Just don’t make her sing, of course.Jon Stewart was in rare form at the 2008 Oscars, where his opening monologue was a hit, a refreshingly droll and appropriately scornful send-up of Hollywood pageantry. The Academy, then, would be well advised to assign hosting duties to his Daily Show successor Trevor Noah, who over the past two years has separated himself from the ever-growing pack of Trump satirists with comedy that’s at once earnest, erudite and screwballish. Noah is charming, too, and one wonders if the Oscars, often ridiculed as a kind of circle-jerk of limousine liberalism, should throw caution to the wind and lean into the low-hanging fruit that is anti-Trump comedy.On the heels of a wildly successful, Emmy-award winning Netflix special, and an opening monologue with Nick Kroll at the 2018 Spirit Awards that was perhaps the most lacerating rebuke of sexually abusive Hollywood heavyweights of last year’s awards season, John Mulaney would be a superb if risky choice to helm the 2019 ceremony. He would not exactly attract as many eyeballs as the aforementioned options, and he would certainly ruffle feathers, but Mulaney’s stock is rising and he would be a fitting choice for an awards body desperate to prove it isn’t out of touch with young folk, who make up a large contingent of Mulaney’s fanbase."},{"url":null,"title":"the 50 best films of 2018 in the uk","story":"Dogs, sea creatures and a coven of witches kick off this year’s countdown of monstrously good movies, updated every weekday.

Solveig tweeted shortly after the ceremony, saying he had apologised to Hegerberg for the remark.The Norwegian forward said: “He came to me afterwards and was really sad that it went that way.

I was just happy to do the dance and win the Ballon d’Or.”Hegerberg added she was extremely proud to be named the first female winner. “It’s incredible,” she said. “This is a great motivation to continue working hard and we will continue to work together to win more titles. I wanted to end with some words for young girls around the world: believe in yourselves.”Andy Murray was among those on social media who criticised Solveig’s comment, calling it “another example of the ridiculous sexism in sport.”“What questions did they ask Mbappé and Modric?” the British tennis player added on Instagram. “I’d imagine something to do with football. And to everyone who thinks I’m overreacting and it was just a joke ... it wasn’t. I’ve been involved in sport my whole life and the level of sexism is unreal.”Modric won a third straight Champions League title and inspired his country to reach the World Cup final, and there are few who will begrudge his victory, with Ronaldo in second. Lionel Messi only came fifth, finishing behind France duo Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé – the first time since 2006 that the Argentina forward has not finished in the top three.There had been a clue that there would be a new winner in the 63rd edition of this award - Blackpool’s Stanley Matthews was the first in 1956 - when neither Ronaldo nor Messi were present at the Grand Palais in Paris, although in typically humble fashion Modric admitted he had been pleasantly surprised to be recognised after being congratulated on his victory by Croatia president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic.Having become the first teenager to score in the World Cup final since Pele in 1958 as France won their second title in Russia, Paris Saint-Germain’s forward Mbappé was the runaway winner of the inaugural Kopa Trophy for the best player under the age of 21 ahead of Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold.

This was down from the previous week, which itself had been a record low.Four members of the England team which beat Croatia to qualify for the Uefa Nations League finals last month did not start for their club sides this weekend and Southgate has called for action to stop the trend.“For parents and boys entering academies, the very nature of it is that you expect there to be opportunity at the end. I go back to previous tournaments when we have reviewed everything that has gone on in English football. So many of those things are in the right place now, so this is just the missing piece. But that is a conundrum we have to solve.”The FA recently drew up proposals to reduce the maximum number of non-homegrown players in any 25-man squad from 17 to 13, a proposal it suggested could be implemented when the UK left the European Union. This suggestion was given short shrift by the Premier League, however, who said that there was “no evidence” that quotas would have a positive impact on national teams.Southgate said discussions were ongoing regarding quotas but that change was imperative for the continuing development of English football. “What’s clear is that we can’t allow the trend to continue as it is because at what point do we stop?” he said. “Everybody saw the impact and the success of the national team in the summer and I think it is now prerogative that, while we still want a competitive Premier League that brings a lot of focus into our country as well, it’s just trying to find this missing piece of development for English football.”Southgate believes the FA and Premier League clubs are in fact in agreement on the importance of progressing young homegrown talent from academy sides to the first team, but that the pressure placed on managers and coaches means they are unwilling to take a risk on inexperienced players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e97f647ecd236ebe0ed8897f70bde7e2de122b6/0_324_6239_3744/master/6239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12bfbf79b3acf8f5e86f647edb363da1","title":"guardian honours football supporters federation","story":"• Sixth straight newspaper-of-the-year title is won• Football Weekly podcast and Barney Ronay also honoured was honoured three times at the Football Supporters’ Federation awards on Monday.The paper was awarded newspaper of the year for the sixth consecutive year, decided by more than 40,000 voting fans.Barney Ronay, senior sports writer, was voted football writer of the year after a stellar 12 months which ranged from the struggle to save Millwall’s ground to the World Cup final in Moscow.Football Weekly, the ’s football podcast, was awarded podcast of the year for the second year running and the fifth time in the last six years.

El Gol Digital report this morning that he “has decided to leave in January” and that Valencia are already close to agreeing a contract. Reports in Italy, however, suggest Fàbregas might move to Milan instead.With the  reporting this morning that Ruben Loftus-Cheek may ask to leave on loan next month, something of a revolution may be brewing on Chelsea’s substitutes’ bench, which currently seems to be rife with jealousy and discontent. On the plus side, their departures would give the club more money to give to Borussia Dortmund for Christian Pulisic, with the Evening Standard saying an official approach has been made for the £70m-rated American.Headline-writers on sports desks nationwide will be crossing fingers, toes and any other crossable bits that the rumoured English interest in RB Salzburg’s Hannes Wolf comes to fruition. Tottenham, Arsenal, Southampton and Everton are all linked with the midfielder (or, in tabloid headline-speak, “hungry for the Wolf”) in the Mirror. “The Austrian attacking midfielder,” they helpfully explain, “has been likened to Spurs star Christian Eriksen.”Arsenal and Tottenham are also battling for another top talent, according to the Mail, with the north London giants joining Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in the race for Feyenoord’s 17-year-old Orkan Kokcu, who scored 17 goals and claimed 34 assists for the club’s Under-19 side last season and “is regarded as one of the brightest emerging talents in European football”.Arsenal and Chelsea are also battling for another top talent, both teams sending scouts to watch Roma’s 2-2 draw with Internazionale on Sunday with Nicolò Zaniolo, Roma’s 19-year-old midfield prodigy, the focus of their attention. Bayern Munich also had a representative present, says CalcioMercato, and though the scouts could of course have been sent to look at different players – indeed, Talksport says they were watching Cengiz Ünder – Zaniolo played very well so we can assume that they noticed him.José Mourinho has “become increasingly baffled” by “Manchester United’s bloated scouting department”, reports the Mail. The club apparently employs 58 scouts across the world but Mourinho wants “a more streamlined operation”, given that he “remains largely in the dark” about their activity below the two chief scouts, and anyway most of the players he seems to want to sign you could find out about just by watching Champions League highlights and the occasional Match of the Day. “Mourinho also fears he will miss out on top target Kalidou Koulibaly in January”, the Mail continues, because “United chiefs vetoed a move last summer” since when the Napoli defender has become both more expensive and more old, without getting more good. According to , Mourinho “has informed United’s board that Koulibaly is his No1 target”, but is also “already giving up hope” of signing him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66377a5386e14754fcfa88510ffc53eda335388e/0_161_5292_3175/master/5292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=037428559437af95eaeb8647ce68de78","title":"manchester city may face champions league ban uefa ffp investigation","story":"Manchester City could be banned from the Champions League, perhaps as early as next season, as Uefa looks set to take strong action should the club be found to have flouted Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. An independent investigation by European football’s governing body into City’s behaviour was recently opened after information was made public by the Football Leaks hack and published in the German magazine Der Spiegel alleged City used sponsorship deals to circumvent rules on how much money owners can put into a club.At a meeting of Uefa’s executive committee in Dublin the president, Aleksander Ceferin, described the investigation as “a concrete case” and pledged an outcome “very soon”. Uefa officials believe the integrity of one of the organisation’s key rules is under threat and that sporting sanctions are the only appropriate response should City be found to have flouted them.The Premier League champions were previously fined £49m for contravening FFP in 2014 but avoided a more severe punishment and subsequently had the fine reduced to £18m after complying with operational and financial measures agreed as part of the punishment.Emails published as part of the Football Leaks revelations, however, suggest that City’s actions had been deeper and more widespread than initially thought.In one correspondence Jorge Chumillas, City’s chief financial officer, appears to reveal that an apparent sponsorship deal by Etihad Airlines, worth £68m to the club, was in fact largely to be paid directly to City by the club’s owners, the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG).Der Spiegel also claimed that as City began to become concerned about failing to meet FFP standards they set up a “closed payment loop” in which ADUG paid a third party to pay City for the image rights to their players. Known internally as “Project Longbow”, it allegedly generated revenues of £11m a year for the club.  has not seen or been able to verify the documents Der Spiegel has used in its reporting.PCity have issued a consistent response to all claims made by Football Leaks and Der Spiegel: “We will not be providing any comment on out-of-context materials purportedly hacked or stolen from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel and associated people.

Kumar has been on the roads of the Indian capital since 9am without a break. He will continue driving until 9pm or 10pm. This is his routine, seven days a week. “When I get home my daughter is asleep. My life is spent in this car,” he says.Kumar is an Uber driver in Mumbai. But the dream he and thousands of other drivers were sold by the company has turned sour.The past few weeks have seen Uber drivers – and those who drive for Ola, the domestic cab aggregator company – on the streets protesting about their conditions, calling their work “slavery”, and demanding that the government intervene.He became a “driver-partner”, in Uber parlance, in early 2016. By working about 10 hours a day, he was able to manage his monthly instalment on the car loan, the cost of fuel and maintenance, and enjoy savings of around 50,000 rupees – an astronomical sum for any Indian driver. “For the first time in my life, I could put some money away,” he says.Certainly, my ride is cheap. The 5km journey in an air-conditioned WagonR costs me 90 rupees – around the same as a hot, windy, uncomfortable ride in an auto-rickshaw. Indian passengers are thrilled with the low fares.But these rates – along with the other measures – are a disaster for drivers. They cannot reduce the size of their monthly car repayments. Those who want to sell the car and get out cannot do so as the resale value won’t be enough to repay the loan. And while the ride rates have fallen, the price of petrol and diesel have gone up.“They are locked into a form of bondage,” says Gautam Mody, secretary of the New Trade Union Initiative, a relatively new national organisation. While many drivers angrily accuse Uber of making false promises, even “guarantees” about income, Mody concedes it is probably unlikely that the San Francisco-based company promised specific numbers in its advertising. What isn’t known is how its agents projected the work.And the fundamental point, in any case, says Mody, is that Indian drivers with barely an education but a strong desire to support their families are vulnerable when anyone promises them a better life. “The fact is that Uber created a perception that spread by word of mouth. I know not just of drivers who left OK jobs, but of office employees – lower level accountants and bank clerks – who left their jobs to earn better money as Uber drivers,” says Mody.Sunil Borkar, head of a Mumbai union that represents Uber drivers, says drivers had been lured into working for the company with big promises and then left high and dry after Uber changed the terms. “Now they are saddled with car loans they can’t pay off. Some are desperate – breaking their backs and just breaking even, if that. There is no exit for them,” says Borkar.When Ramesh Sethi recently visited an Uber office outside Delhi, pretending to be interested in joining, he was given the hard sell. “They told me I could earn big sums, that I could save as much as 40,000-60,000 rupees a month after expenses if I worked hard. They said it all depended on the hours I was prepared to put in,” says Sethi. They also held out a bait: join right now by paying a 2,000 rupee fee and we will give you a 5,000 rupee lump sum the moment you start.Borkar says the chief minister of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, has agreed to meet him soon to try to resolve the problem.But Mody says ad hoc meetings in one state or the other are not the answer. “The crux of it is that it’s a lawless industry. It needs to be regulated to protect both passengers and drivers,” he sau.An Uber spokesman said: “Over the past two years, as the popularity of our service has increased, we have moved from a startup mode to a more sustainable business model and started to reduce higher levels of incentives while investing more in drivers and our products for the long term. Hence, while driver incentives across India have tapered from the 2016 levels, earnings have largely remained sustainable and consistent over the past several months.“We keep experimenting with our incentive structures, which may differ from city to city and can vary between one driver partner to another, based on the kind of incentive structures they opt for. That said, we are focused on ensuring that offering trips through the Uber App remain attractive. Driver earnings across India have largely remained sustainable and consistent over the last year.”The spokesman acknowledged that recent fuel price increases have impacted earnings, and said the company had introduced a mechanism to ensure driver earnings across India correlate with changes in the price of fuel. The mechanism has been rolled out in Mumbai.He added that Uber is also “working towards providing driver partners access to health insurance, life insurance and micro loans and a host of other benefits aimed at improving their welfare”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909ed19610b6b4fa645e57ef8027363ef17dd8ab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90237ba1b83c5e0a94a89398e554788f","title":"honduras a dam and the of berta caceres","story":"Seven men have been convicted of the murder of an award-winning environmental activist in Honduras.

In this particular case for the government, I think that would be the wrong thing to do.”The contempt motion, submitted late on Monday, calls on MPs to find “ministers in contempt for their failure to comply” and is signed by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer the DUP’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds and the Scottish National party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party.No penalty is spelled out in the motion, which is intended to act as a final warning, but Labour said that if it was passed on Tuesday and not still complied with then the party would seek further sanctions.The party indicated it would then seek to hold a senior minister – likely to be either the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, or the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox – in contempt and seek their suspension from the Commons.However, Labour sources said their priority remained getting the legal advice published, rather than forcing a minister to be punished.Bercow ruled late in the evening that he would accept a contempt motion after the six parties wrote to him jointly complaining that the summary Brexit legal advice released on Monday did not comply with a Commons resolution agreed on 13 November.The Speaker declared on Monday night that there was “an arguable case that a contempt has been committed” after Labour and others complained that “the information released today does not constitute the final and full advice provided by the attorney general to the cabinet”.Panicked Conservatives flooded the Commons chamber late into the evening to filibuster a debate on Scotland’s foreign policy footprint, to give their party’s whips time to submit their own amendment to the contempt motion.Downing Street declined to respond on Monday night, but the governing party put down an amendment seeking to refer the matter to the Commons privileges committee, in an attempt to kick it into the long grass.A Labour source said the government motion, submitted by Andrea Leadsom, “implicitly accepts they are in contempt but seeks to play for time before the meaningful vote”, calling it disrespectful to parliament.The Speaker accepted the plea from the combined opposition parties after a fractious two-and-a-half-hour debate in which Cox repeatedly refused to release the full legal advice on the Brexit deal he had provided to cabinet.The row is likely to overshadow the first day of the five-day debate, which May intends to lead in her increasingly fraught attempt to get her Brexit deal endorsed by parliament.Cox conceded in Monday’s debate that he was at risk of being declared in contempt of parliament for his actions when he became the first attorney general for 40 years to appear before MPs to take questions.The government’s chief legal officer said MPs must decide “whether or not an attorney general, seeking to protect the public interest” was in contempt. He said he had “sought to comply with the spirit of it to the maximum degree” by putting himself before MPs and publishing a 45-page summary earlier in the day.Ominously for May, some hard-Brexit MPs said they were unsatisfied by the decision to defy an earlier Commons resolution calling for full publication.Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Cox of not explaining why ministers were refusing to comply with the Commons motion. “It is no longer a matter for the government to judge it has been decided by this house, which is a higher authority,” he said.On 13 November, the Commons unanimously agreed to a motion put down by Labour calling for the legal advice on the Brexit deal to be published “in full”. Conservative MPs were told to abstain after it became clear that the government was not certain of winning the vote when the DUP said it would vote with Labour.Cox told the Commons on Monday that the government had made a mistake at the time. He said: “We should have opposed it,” although he added that he would not have complied even if the vote had been lost.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister who has been a spokesman for the party’s Eurosceptics, hinted at a way out for Cox. He queried why the government had not accepted an amendment to the original Labour motion, tabled by Tory MPs which was “highly sympathetic” to Cox’s position.Asked whether he would consider bringing a new motion to avoid a contempt vote, Cox suggested that was under consideration.The government’s chief lawyer sought to sell the Brexit deal to MPs on the grounds that it represented “a calculated risk”.The attorney general admitted that he would have preferred to have seen “a unilateral right of termination” in the controversial Northern Ireland backstop and “a clause that would have allowed us to exit if negotiations had irretrievably broken down”. Downing Street had hoped to start persuading backbenchers to support May’s deal despite widespread concern in her party that the UK could become trapped in the backstop. May spoke with small groups of backbench MPs in her Commons office throughout the day.On Tuesday, the prime minister will open the five-day debate leading up to the final vote next week by saying that the British people have already twice voted to deliver Brexit.The prime minister will argue that the British public showed what they wanted “by voting overwhelmingly for parties that committed to delivering Brexit” in the referendum and in the 2017 election Both Conservative and Labour manifestos at the last election said they respected the leave vote in the 2016 referendum.Tuesday’s debate will be closed by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the following days will be themed, with senior cabinet ministers speaking in support of the deal.Wednesday’s theme will be security, and the debate will be opened by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and closed by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary. On Thursday, the focus will be on the economy, opened by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and closed by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/127bc693bd004aafca03bd89dc10a6ebd53593a7/147_0_3769_2262/master/3769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85b6c44e4335bfc3f246fadfb15df810","title":"can the uk get an extension on brexit","story":"Delaying Britain’s exit from the EU is one possibility – others include revoking article 50, or simply rejoiningIn the stormy Westminster debate on Brexit, one idea that is gaining ground each day is that the UK should seek to delay its departure from the EU. The SNP is only the latest to call for extra time: the party said on Monday it wanted an extension of article 50 beyond March 2019 so that the government could “go back and negotiate a better deal”.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, thinks the EU and the government could be persuaded to extend article 50 if MPs reject Theresa May’s deal on 11 December. Meanwhile, prominent supporters of a second referendum, such as the Conservative former cabinet minister Justine Greening, think the exit clause could be extended until the end of July 2019 to allow time for another vote.In 115 days’ time, if nothing else happens, the UK will leave the EU. Like everything else in Brexit negotiations, extending article 50 is not simple, and the EU holds all the cards.The EU treaty is clear: a country’s exit negotiations can be extended with the unanimous agreement of the remaining member states. But article 50 is otherwise silent about procedure or timing.Since the day the British government lit the fuse on article 50, EU officials have suggested a few weeks’ extension would be possible – in certain circumstances. The point of extra time would be to finalise ratification and tie up legal niceties (such as translation of texts), to avoid an accidental no-deal. Now, the talk of the Brussels coffee bars is whether the UK could get to delay Brexit because of a political shift, such as a second referendum. In this case, extension is not ruled out but runs into the hurdle of European elections due on 23-26 May 2019.Nevertheless, some diplomats speculate that it could be possible to engineer an extension until mid-summer, before the first sitting of the European parliament, which is usually in July. This reflects a desire to find a pragmatic answer if the UK needs more time, but it is a minority view, not backed up by formal legal opinion. The majority insist the UK would still need to take part in May’s elections, even if the extension expired in June or July.Simpler than extension, could the UK simply cancel the article 50 notification? That is the nub of a case before the European court of justice on “whether, when and how” article 50 notification “can unilaterally be revoked” by the UK. Remainers, as well as the Scottish politicians who brought the case, received a massive boost on Tuesday, when a senior jurist at the ECJ concluded that article 50 could be withdrawn by the state that triggered it. Preventing the revocation of article 50 could mean the “forced exit” of a country that was still an EU member state, said an ECJ advocate general, whose advice is usually followed by the court.The ECJ’s final ruling is not expected until the end of this month, so MPs will not have a definitive answer when they vote on May’s deal.But the preliminary opinion suggests that if the UK chose to revoke article 50, it would be a decision to cancel Brexit, not gain extra time for negotiations – the UK would be expected to withdraw its notification in “good faith”. In this way, the advocate general seeks to tackle the arguments of EU lawyers, who contended that allowing a state to cancel article 50 would leave the union in “endless uncertainty”, allowing a country to stop and start the countdown clock to get better terms.Faced with the looming deadline, some think the UK would be better off leaving and trying to return during the Brexit transition. In other words, forget article 50 and focus on article 49, the EU treaty provision on joining the club. One member of the European parliament’s Brexit steering group, the Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, has counselled remainers to adopt this strategy – assuming the option to return won in a referendum or general election.EU officials are less convinced a return would be so straightforward or quick. The UK’s readmission would require the consent of 27 countries, some led by populist anti-EU governments and coalitions. The UK would not regain the special deal it has now, including a generous rebate and opt-outs on other EU policies. “It is a high-risk strategy,” one senior official said. If that was the plan, “they really have to stop the train before it leaves the station”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc1e1e0b9f8827f891b67c9ce81f5f07078436a/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb1edee71d3d8f5e60b0173ea38e20b","title":"uk can stop article 50 without eu approval top ecj adviser says","story":"European court of justice likely to endorse opinion in case taken by anti-Brexit campaignersThe UK can unilaterally abandon the article 50 process, a senior adviser to the European court of justice (ECJ) has said, in a significant boost to anti-Brexit campaigners.Campos Sánchez-Bordona said he believed EU law allowed the UK to revoke article 50 without requiring the formal agreement of the European commission or other EU member states.In his formal opinion, Sánchez-Bordona said it was essential MPs knew they could stop the Brexit process, dismissing the UK government’s claims the issue was hypothetical.The UK government and European commission had insisted the Brexit process could be stopped only by unanimous agreement, even though EU treaties were silent on how an article 50 application could be withdrawn.Sánchez-Bordona’s opinion is a major boost for a cross-party group of Scottish parliamentarians, led by Andy Wightman, a Scottish Green party MSP. They launched their legal action in December last year.Alyn Smith, a Scottish National party MEP involved in the legal action, said the opinion confirmed their long-held view that Westminster could “stop the clock” on Brexit.“We now have a roadmap out of the Brexit shambles, a bright light has switched on above an ‘exit’ sign and the false choice being offered to MPs at Westminster – that it is Mrs May’s disastrous deal or chaos – is shown for what it is, an abuse of parliament,” he said.The UK government had fought strenuously to prevent the case reaching the European court, tabling a last-minute appeal with the UK supreme court only days before the hearing in Luxembourg. The appeal was rejected.After a series of hearings at the court of session in Edinburgh, the court of justice held an emergency hearing in Luxembourg late last month, taking the rare step of convening all 28 judges.While the opinion from Sánchez-Bordona is not binding on the judges, it is unusual for the ECJ to reach a decision that contradicts the advice of an advocate general.If the court endorses his opinion, anti-Brexit campaigners will seize on the ruling as proof that Brexit can be reversed by MPs more smoothly than the UK government has argued.However, they face one further hurdle: the ECJ will return the case to the Scottish courts, which will need to issue a final ruling on the issue within weeks.In the opinion released on Tuesday morning by the ECJ, Sánchez-Bordona rejected the UK government’s argument that the issue of whether article 50 could be unilaterally revoked was hypothetical.Lord Keen, the UK’s Scottish law adviser, had told the ECJ the UK government had no intention of abandoning Brexit under any circumstances, making the question inadmissible.The court of justice said Sánchez-Bordona disagreed. “According to the advocate general, the dispute is genuine, the question is not merely academic, nor premature or superfluous, but has obvious practical importance and is essential in order to resolve the dispute,” the court said.It added that he believed an article 50 process should be handled in the same way as any other international treaty: if a party wished to withdraw from it, it was able to do so unilaterally because it was a sovereign state.Jolyon Maugham QC, a lawyer and anti-Brexit campaigner whose Good Law Project funded the legal action, said the advocate general’s opinion “puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives, where it belongs … I’m sure MPs will now search their consciences and act in the best interests of the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd56f2afc3e3fc2359e2ef3563663dbfd846a0af/113_0_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0040c3a091df36e49263969e05428b1","title":"nasa osiris rex bennu asteroid","story":" Osiris-Rex spacecraft will eventually scoop up material for analysis back homeAfter a two-year chase, a Nasa probe has reached the ancient asteroid Bennu. The robotic explorer Osiris-Rex pulled within 12 miles (19km) of the diamond-shaped object on Monday and will go into orbit around it on 31 December. No spacecraft has ever orbited such a small body.Bennu is considered a potentially hazardous asteroid – it is due to make a close pass of Earth about 150 years. If it collided with Earth, Bennu would probably cause a crater.Osiris-Rex aims to collect at least 60 grams (two ounces) of dust and gravel, the first such attempt by the US after a smaller mission to another asteroid by Japan. The spacecraft won’t land but use a three-metre mechanical arm in 2020 to momentarily touch down and pick up particles. The sample container is planned to break loose and head toward Earth in 2021.The collection – parachuting down to Utah – would represent the biggest such haul since the Apollo astronauts hand-delivered moon rocks to Earth in the late 1960s and early 1970s.Scientists hope to learn more about the source of water in the solar system and the origins of organic molecules from which life first arose. Getting their hands on pristine asteroid material might also yield clues about how to mine them for valuable materials and defend against wayward ones that might threaten Earth.Flight controllers applauded and exchanged high-fives on Monday once confirmation came through that Osiris-Rex made it to Bennu – exactly one week after Nasa landed a spacecraft on Mars.“Relieved, proud, and anxious to start exploring!” tweeted lead scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona. “To Bennu and back!”Bennu is 76m miles (122m km) away so it took seven minutes for word of the success to reach flight controllers at Lockheed Martin in Littleton, Colorado, where the spacecraft was built.Bennu is estimated to be just over 1,600ft (500 metres) across. Researchers will provide a more precise description at a scientific meeting on Monday next week in Washington.About the size of a large car, the spacecraft will shadow the asteroid for a year, before scooping up some gravel for return to Earth in 2023.A Japanese spacecraft, meanwhile, has been hanging out at another near-Earth asteroid since June, also for samples. It is Japan’s second asteroid mission. This latest rock is named Ryugu and is about double the size of Bennu.Ryugu’s specks should be here by December 2020 but will be far less than Osiris-Rex’s promised booty.Nasa has brought back comet dust and solar wind particles before but never asteroid samples. Japan managed to return some tiny particles in 2010 from its first asteroid mission, named Hayabusa.Contact with Bennu will not significantly change its orbit or make it more dangerous to Earth, Lauretta stressed.The $800m Osiris-Rex mission began with a 2016 launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Its odometer read 1.2bn miles (2bn km) as of Monday.Both the spacecraft and asteroid’s names come from Egyptian mythology. Osiris is the god of the afterlife, while Bennu represents the heron and creation.Osiris-Rex is actually a Nasa acronym for origins, spectral interpretation, resource identification, security-regolith explorer.Associated Press contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d80a8142dea6d88a97a5a83eb5058fde03c5282b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e8054f2148bd6b3c65b74d7f6ea64fb","title":"tough as old boots a thames skeletons durable footwear tideway tunnel","story":"Archaeologists say man who died 500 years ago may have been a mudlark or fishermanHe was found lying on his front, head twisted to the side. One arm was bent above his head, suggesting he had fallen – or perhaps had been pushed – to his death in the river more than five centuries ago.But aside from his puzzling position, the skeleton discovered this year near the shore of the Thames in London was notable for another, very particular reason. Though his clothes had long since decayed, on the man’s feet were a pair of remarkably well preserved – and extremely rare – knee-high leather boots. Might they hold clues, archaeologists wondered, to who the man was and, just possibly, how he died?The mystery of the man in the medieval wellies was uncovered in Bermondsey by archaeologists working on the Thames Tideway tunnel, the so-called “super-sewer” currently being built to update the capital’s Victorian sewage network.It’s not unusual to find bodies on the foreshore, but the style and preservation of the man’s footwear, made of leather “quarters” stitched together with waxed flax thread, is exceptional, say archaeologists.“Leather can be very well preserved in London, especially if it’s found in a ditch that would have been full of water, or near the riverfront,” said Beth Richardson, a finds specialist for the archaeological team from Mola Headland Infrastructure. In the absence of any metalwork or other dating evidence, the style of the boots – unheeled, with a single, flat sole reinforced with “clump soles” at the front and back – dated the skeleton to the late 1400s or early 1500s at the latest.The fact that they reach the knee makes it likely the boots were waders, experts think, making it possible the man worked in or around the river as a dock worker, mudlark or fisherman. Mariners of the time were known to wear long boots, according to Richardson, as evidenced by the large number found on the wreck of the Tudor warship the Mary Rose.And like their modern-day welly-boot equivalent, they are nothing fancy. “These were very simple boots,” says Richardson. They are not fashionable at all, they haven’t got buckles or anything like that – they are just practical, everyday boots.” Conservation work to preserve the leather is still ongoing, and there is no immediate plan to put the boots on display.Plant matter found inside the boots is yet to be analysed, but the archaeologists suspect it was a lining of moss that had been added to keep the man’s feet warm as he waded.Even without his distinctive footwear, however, there are clues to his identity. Evidence of extensive degenerative joint disease along his spine and left hip joint show he lived a physical life and would have suffered pain every day, according to Niamh Carty, an osteologist. Though she could not rule out that he was younger than 35, she believes he was probably much older.In addition, the man has distinctive grooves in his teeth, “a possible indication of pulling some sort of material over the biting surface of the teeth or holding an object in the teeth for prolonged periods of time,” said Carty. One possibility is that he was pulling rope between his teeth, as a fisherman might.As for how the man came to die, we will never know for sure, but there is no evidence of foul play, according to the archaeologists.“He may have been working in the river and the tide got too much for him, he may have fallen over, he may have been tired,” Richardson said. “He may have had too much to drink. We really don’t know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eea6cc492bfc43a1d5b43d51afaf6bedf865796/0_266_3991_2395/master/3991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf6f18bcb374c29c22fc5346d296637b","title":"kalashnikov arkle trophy plumpton cheltenham","story":"“I didn’t watch a lot of it,” Amy Murphy admitted after her stable star Kalashnikov maintained his unbeaten record over fences here on Monday. “But it sounded very good.” It looked very good, too, as Kalashnikov ran away with the novice chase without leaving second gear and last year’s Betfair Hurdle winner is now the 5-1 joint-favourite with Lalor for the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham in March.The downhill fences on the far side of this track can make it a difficult test for a novice. Kalashnikov, though, jumped fluently throughout and was still full of running as he powered down to the last with a long lead.

At the start of this year Hall had never won an LPGA tournament as a professional. She ends it having celebrated the fact her first victory in Europe happened to be a major, when she won the British Open in August, and that she has broken into the world’s top 10.The 22-year-old from Bournemouth had to struggle to reach this point because, as the daughter of a plasterer, she did not always have the money to play in tournaments for which she had already qualified. Her life is much easier now, as she received a winner’s cheque of £375,000 after winning the Open at Royal Lytham, and the clarity of Hall’s ambition is soon apparent.Hall responds emphatically when asked if she would prefer to become the world’s best golfer before winning another major. “Yeah, I’d take world No 1 for sure. That’s the dream.”Her victory was made more special because her father, Wayne, was her caddie for the week. A golf nut who had named her Georgia in honour of Nick Faldo’s victory in the Masters at Augusta shortly before her birth in April 1996, Wayne Hall takes over from Tyrrell at every Open. “He’s always done the British and the Scottish Open. Harry doesn’t mind stepping down those two weeks. He knows it’s a big thing for my dad.”On the Sunday afternoon Hall trailed Thailand’s Pornanong Phatlum by a single shot. They were pitted against each other in the last pairing, which became a compelling shootout. Hall’s final round of 67 sealed her victory by two shots from Phatlum. “I was in a perfect position,” Hall suggests, “because I kept saying: ‘Why am I nervous? Someone else must be more nervous because she’s leading. So, Georgia, calm down.’ It helped that Pornanong smiles a lot and we both settled down to play well. I was very calm.“It was far harder on the Saturday front nine. I was the most nervous I’ve ever been but I holed eight big putts in six holes – most were 25-footers. After that I thought: ‘This is my tournament now.’ I was trying to control my emotions all week. I knew if I got caught up in the atmosphere I would have lost the tournament. My dad was very nervous but we didn’t say one word about winning. We just talked about the next shot, which I liked.”Her dad wore the same pair of socks every day as, after the first of four successive sub-70 rounds, he did not want to change her luck. “I didn’t know that until the last day,” Hall says, wrinkling her nose. “On our way to the club he said: ‘I’ve been wearing the same socks every day, by the way. I was going to change them but you played so well the first day I didn’t.’ Hopefully he’s washed them by now.”There was a deeper family backdrop. “My grandad was really ill and I probably wouldn’t have won without playing for him. Every time I hit a bad shot or got too excited, I would think: ‘Come on, do it for grandad.’ He passed away two weeks later but I’m glad he kind of witnessed it. I phoned him up later on in the day and he was so happy I won.”Her victory came after 15 years of hard work amid challenging financial circumstances. “My dad was a plasterer and my mum a hairdresser. He played golf and took me down to the local driving range when I was seven. I then joined the kids’ club and I was the only girl. There were seven levels, and I got to the top level quickly. I was beating all the boys and they used to hate that. They were quite embarrassed.“I did cross-country and football and I was in the boys’ cricket team. I was the only girl. I was a pretty good batsman because I would swing my bat like a golf club. I used to really whack it. I didn’t know it at the time but it was tough for my parents. They didn’t tell me this until a few years ago. But they always had to sell some things for me to have enough money for golf lessons and tournaments. We lived quite far down south and so dad would drive me for four hours to get to a two-hour lesson and then drive me back – on top of working.“Golf is one of the most expensive sports you can play. You need to pay a lot to join a club, you need golf clubs, all the equipment, lessons. It was hard and I missed three majors I’d qualified for because of a lack of funds. I was in the top three in the world as an amateur but we couldn’t afford to get to me there. I could only get to the British Open. That was frustrating but I always said I will be fine in the end.”Francesco Molinari, who won the 2018 Open, received a cheque for £1.42m which meant he earned £1,045,000 more than Hall. “We’re paid very well on the women’s tour, but we can’t do anything about that big difference. We work just as hard as the men and we’re very good. If you watch an LPGA tournament the standard is incredible. But the men earn so much more.”Tennis is different as women receive the same amount of prize money as the men for winning the grand slams. “Yeah, it’s happened already in tennis even though they’re playing less. Maybe they should play the same number of sets and get paid the same money. We’re playing the same amount of holes as the men.”Hall is taking a break after such a busy year. “I’m going to Barbados. I hope I don’t get bored because the last time I had a holiday I was six years old. We went to Spain for two weeks. So this one feels overdue. I’m purposely flying home first to drop my clubs off to make sure I don’t play on holiday. I have to make sure I don’t hit a ball otherwise my mind won’t be fresh next year.”Does she still play against Harry – who had been hoping to become a professional? “Not for a while,” Hall says, “but he can still hit a golf ball. He’s decent.”Hall smiles when I ask who has won the most over their years of golfing rivalry. “Oh, me. Harry’s won about four times.” Tyrrell shakes his head. “A long time ago.” Does he plan to try to play against a woman who aims to become world No 1? “No,” he says with a grin, “it’s too much.”Hall nods intently. “I’m just very competitive at everything. I just want to win, all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d47e7588a4414888f26faae8809518245196a9/58_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3a3c2309359e47f300721197e8c9aa","title":"forbes seven year old youtuber ryan toys review made 17m in one year","story":"US toy reviewer Ryan beats UK’s Daniel Middleton to the top spot for highest earningsA seven-year-old American boy who reviews toys has topped a list of the highest-earning YouTube stars after making £17.3m in a year.Ryan, from Ryan ToysReview, made the sum for his online reviews between June 2017 and June 2018.

As a result adult material has flooded the service, where it sits alongside other fandoms for everything from Harry Potter to anime.However, attempts to provide a “safe mode” for younger users have sometimes caused problems. Last month the Tumblr app was removed from Apple’s app store after its filtering system inadvertently allowed some child pornography to appear on the social network.Tumblr’s chief executive, Jeff D’Onofrio, said that as the site has grown, its responsibilities to “different age groups, demographics, cultures, and mindsets” have increased and it has now decided to remove all adult material from 17 December.“We spent considerable time weighing the pros and cons of expression in the community that includes adult content. In doing so, it became clear that without this content we have the opportunity to create a place where more people feel comfortable expressing themselves,” he said.“Bottom line: There are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content. We will leave it to them and focus our efforts on creating the most welcoming environment possible for our community.”Tumblr said all content including photos, videos or gifs that “show real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples” would be banned, alongside any content that depicts sex acts. The site insisted that it would still allow non-sexualised images of women’s nipples, in situations such as breastfeeding or works of art.Websites such as Tumblr were founded in a different internet era when the focus was on the right to publish material. They are increasingly having to rethink their policies after years of criticism for being too permissive and having weak moderation, with major companies increasingly concerned about the content their adverts are appearing alongside.The decision also reflects challenges at Oath, the media business which owns Tumblr in addition to many former assets of Yahoo and AOL such as the Huffington Post.Oath was founded in a bid to build an online media business that had sufficient scale to challenge Facebook and Google for advertising revenue, but has recently seen the departure of chief executive Tim Armstrong, with its parent company, the US telecoms firm Verizon, taking a closer interest in its activities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bcafb31972aced2de66089d691e1a972d1cd1d8/0_0_4055_2433/master/4055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a43b37f1b655bc9958dac8deca58ef4","title":"apple macbook air review the new default mac","story":"A beautiful, crisp display, good performance and modern ports rejuvenate a classicApple has finally given the MacBook Air the update fans have been craving for the last three years: new processors and a vastly improved Retina display. But is this the new Mac laptop for most people or has it lost some of the desirability and shine while stagnating since 2015?When closed, the new MacBook Air looks pretty much the same as the old one. The aluminium frame is still wedge-shaped. It still has the cut-out in the deck to lift the screen and still has the Apple logo emblazoned on the lid, even if it is now metallic and shiny rather than being light-up opaque plastic.But side by side it is clear this is a smaller, more modern Mac shrunk in both width and length, but not in height, fitting exactly into the footprint of the current 13in MacBook Pro. Gone, too, are the old selection of ports from the Air, reduced to only two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and one headphone socket. USB-C is the industry standard port of the moment, with Thunderbolt 3 adding much greater capacity and future proofing, but the lack of an SD card reader is disappointing.Open it up and essentially what you are looking at is the screen and deck of a MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. Gone are the large grey bezels around the 13.3in screen from the Air, replaced with thinner black borders as used on other Apple laptops.The MacBook Air has Apple’s third-generation butterfly keyboard, a large force-touch trackpad and speakers drilled into either side. In the top right is the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which is noticeably faster than Apple’s previous iterations, but instead of a Touch Bar you have regular F keys. While the Touch Bar can be useful, many don’t like it and most will probably be happy the MacBook Air does not have it.Some will love the keyboard, some will hate it because it is still pretty clicky with minimal key travel. It isn’t my favourite keyboard on a laptop but it is crisp and responsive and I have no problem typing for long periods of time on it. Everyone should love the trackpad, however, which is the best in the business. It is big, smooth, responsive and totally solid, despite the feeling of motion when you push down on it provided by the Taptic Engine haptic motor below it.Build quality is top notch, with no noticeable give or flex in any part of the machine. Weighing 1.25kg, the Air is about the same as rivals such as Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 2 and is slim enough that you don’t really notice it in a backpack. But it is noticeably heavier than the 921g 12in MacBook or 770g Surface Pro 6 (1.08kg with keyboard attached). At its thickest part it is also 0.7mm thicker than the MacBook Pro.The MacBook Air as tested had 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.The MacBook Air has a relatively unusual mix of hardware for 2018. It only has one choice of processor, an eighth-generation Intel Core i5 processor, but it isn’t the same quad-core U-series processor available in the 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, instead it is a dual-core Y-series chip.While the fine points of processor names are probably lost on most Mac buyers, Y-series chips are lower power in performance and energy consumption than their U-series siblings. For the MacBook Air, Apple has mixed things up a little – most computers that use Y-series chips are fanless, but the MacBook Air has a small fan, which means it should maintain performance for longer by better dissipating heat. Not that I ever heard the fan in day-to-day use, unlike the old MacBook Air.Performance is very similarly to a dual-core 2017 MacBook Pro, falling down only in intensive multiprocess tasks, where both laptops are far behind the 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar partly because it has a quad-core processor.With a fast SSD and RAM, therefore, the MacBook Air feels snappy in all tasks and will easily handle most day-to-day activities. It was a pleasure to use. Only if you attempt to do something graphically or arithmetically challenging, such as attempting to play the latest game, edit multiple 4K videos or mine cryptocurrency, will you find the MacBook Air struggles.The MacBook Air is capable of seeing out a work day without having to be plugged in, lasting about nine hours between charges. That was with the brightness set about two-thirds, 20 or so tabs open in Chrome, iA Writer, Reeder and various chat apps in constant use, while listing to Spotify over Bluetooth headphones for four hours. More conservative use should mean about 10 hours of productivity but it won’t come close to the 14 or so hours some managed to squeeze out of the previous MacBook Air.MacOS hasn’t radically changed in years, iterating small elements of the interface with each update, while improving the performance of the underlying system. Now at version 10.14 Mojave, the biggest visual change is the introduction of a dark mode to the interface, which is meant to be for concentrating at night or similar, but I found it a nice change and left it on all the time.Mojave also brought some of Apple’s iOS apps to the Mac, including Apple News and Voice Memos. For the most part you cannot tell that the app is a port of sorts of an iOS app. The Apple News app works more or less as any regular Mac app would, but with fewer features and options than you might be used to on macOS, and the same goes for Voice Memos, which syncs with the Voice Memos app on iOS.MacOS is a mature and stable operating system that anyone who has used Windows 10 or most versions of Linux will be able to adjust to relatively easily.The Apple MacBook Air is available in silver, space grey and gold costing £1,199 with a dual-core Intel Core i5 Y-series processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or £1,399 with 256GB of storage.Options are available with up to 16GB of RAM for an extra £180, 512GB of storage for £400 and 1.5TB of storage for £1,200, reaching a maximum price of £2,579.In many ways the original MacBook Air became the default Mac for most people. It was a highly capable machine that didn’t cost the earth (for an Apple product).The new MacBook Air lives up to most of the standards set by its predecessor. It is highly capable machine that will handle the majority of what most people need to get done. It’s not an exciting or ground-breaking computer but it is the new workhorse for all those who don’t need serious graphical or processing performance but must use a Mac.However, since the last version of the MacBook Air launched in 2015, competition in the sub-£1,300 premium laptop category has increased dramatically. With strong options from Dell, Microsoft and many others that are often cheaper and more powerful than the new MacBook Air, if you aren’t tied into MacOS there are arguably better options.For those Apple buyers who have been lost in the gap between the tiny 12in MacBook and the costly 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the new MacBook Air delivers. In fact, I would say the MacBook Air is the new default Mac – and not only because it’s the cheapest. It is arguably the most balanced and, therefore, best Apple laptop currently available.Cons: expensive, no SD card reader, only two USB-CThunderbolt 3 ports, only a 30W charger in the box, butterfly keyboard has had problems with longevity in previous versions This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Hundreds of historic boundary stones – the symbol of the Rennsteig – mark the route and tell their own story about how this path was for years a border between the Franconian and Thuringian provinces.The 105-mile route winds down from the town of Eisenach (home of Wartburg Castle), via Suhl, and ends at Blankenstein, right on the current border between Thuringia and Bavaria. Today, there’s also a 120-mile cycle path that runs almost parallel to the walking route, but with longer deviations to avoid too many buttock-bashing hill climbs. But while the cycle path is still a teenager, the classic hiking route is nearly 700 years old. You can sense the souls that have trodden this famous path over the years, along the historic ridgeline above the forests. Some 100,000 walkers come every year to explore this evocative slice of countryside. And deep below your feet a plethora of tunnels carry some of Germany’s most important road and rail routes – including the tubes carrying the brand new Erfurt to Nuremberg high-speed railway.2 The Hochrhoener trail Parts of the Hochrhoener trail extend into Hesse and Bavaria, but its heart lies in Thuringia. Running from Bad Kissingen to Bad Salzungen, via Kreuzberg and the Wasserkuppe mountain, the Hochrhoener trail snakes for 87 miles. It is split into nine stages, if you only want to walk a portion of the longer trail, and crests out at an impressive 876 metres. And if you still feel like you want to go higher, the Hochrhoener is the perfect place for gliding in Thuringia. If you gaze skywards from the paths you can often see gliders catching the currents, which are perfect here due to the geography of the mountains and the way the weather systems work their way through the area. Stargazers can veer off the main path on the Geba trail to discover the “Sternenpark” or Star Park – one of Europe’s leading dark sky landscapes. With platforms and viewing devices provided, it is ideal for gazing into space and spotting stars and planets. And for a taste of history, you can explore the Point Alpha trail leading to the Point Alpha military installations and the remains of the former inner German border – the iron curtain. In this area on the border there’s also Merkers mine – a former salt mine, where the Nazis stashed treasures during the second world war.3 The Thuringian Chain-of-Towns – long-distance cycle trailArchitecture aficionados will love this journey through the buildings and history of Thuringia’s main urban centres. The Chain-of-Towns trail runs for a total of 140 miles, but most of that is over flat to gently sloping ground – so the going is not like pulling teeth. And the route is also perhaps best enjoyed in small portions. Electric bikes are encouraged and regular charging stations pepper the route, plus there are a slew of DB (Deutsche Bahn) railway stations along the way, where you can let the train take the strain if you don’t want to cycle the whole thing. The Chain-of-Towns trail begins in Eisenach, home to the Unesco world heritage site, Wartburg Castle. Next, Gotha and its castle Schloss Friedenstein. Cosmopolitan Erfurt’s student population ensures plenty of bars, and its handsome, historic centre is home to such architectural highlights as the Old Synagogue – one of Europe’s oldest, which is itself home to the famous Erfurt Treasure of gold and silver. Then it’s on to historic Weimar and Jena, and then to Altenburg, where the route concludes.4 Saale cycle route – hills aplentyThose double-wheeled daredevils who look in awe at the Tour de France’s King of the Mountains exploits can find their cycling satisfaction on this challenging and ultimately rewarding run through the heart of the Thuringian hills following the River Saale. Coming in at a thigh-chafing 250 miles, the Saale cycle route calls for plenty of Vaseline in the panniers. The first part of the route from picturesque Fichtelgebirge through the high hills is the most spectacular, and tea breaks can be taken while you marvel at gorges or pristine lakes. As the river widens and flattens, castles and vineyards become more common sights. Bad Sulza’s wineries are especially noted for their bottles of Grüner Veltliner or Muscat Ottonel. Reaching Saalfeld, cyclists or walkers find the mesmerising Fairy Grottoes, listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s most colourful caves. Then, finally, you find peaceful meadows before the river joins the Elbe and flows on its long journey up to Hamburg and the North Sea. Jena is one of Thuringia’s main towns and provides plenty of sleeping, eating and shopping options. Optical innovator Zeiss was founded here and the town’s Zeiss Planetarium is rightly known for its audio and video shows.5 Schwarza Valley Panorama trail – for tree loversFans of forests can revel in this peaceful adventure through the trees that sprout on the eastern side of the Thuringian forest nature park. The park is packed with dense thickets of coniferous trees that provide a habitat for a huge variety of bird and animal species, and you can even forage for wild mushrooms and garlic. This 84-mile trail follows a loop route, starting and finishing in pretty Rudolstadt. Along the way, the trail passes various picture-postcard villages and towns such as Bad Blankenburg, Meuselbach, Altenfeld and Cordobang. The path sometimes rises out from the forest and up into the foothills of the Thuringian Schiefergebirge mountains – whose height and scenic value give the Saxon Switzerland hills, or even the Bavarian mountains, a run for their money. Aside from the obvious arboreal attractions, the Schwarza Valley Panorama trail also passes near to several castles perched on the banks of the River Saale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29183fbc69ae8c99a64004797697aeb9ca67dd87/0_315_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496846af42c7313821eb685e53f0279","title":"from bach to bauhaus discover the culture of thuringia germany","story":"Immerse yourself in the German artistic gems that changed how we see the worldThuringia is the cultural heart of Germany, a place of inspiration for world-famous artists, writers, musicians and intellectuals. Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd65faa3b93e5c08509382c208d06bddb43ec1a/0_1_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe53e88f6e4e7958eddd3c5d549856e","title":"from chocolate to beef roulade the culinary delights of thuringia","story":"The German region may be known for its castles, jaw-dropping landscapes and the famous faces who lived there, but its culinary scene is also something to check out when you visitGerman food is just sausages, isn’t it, and sauerkraut? Well, yes, they do have 1,200 types of wurst – but this is a country with a huge ersity of cuisine, both traditional and contemporary. With more than 200 types of bread, a nationwide passion for vegetables, and an infinite range of regional styles, served everywhere from rural inns to the country’s 300-plus Michelin-starred restaurants, Germany is arguably home to some of the most underrated cuisine in Europe. And the culinary scene in Thuringia is well worth shouting about.So if the state’s erse history, from Martin Luther and Goethe to the Weimar Republic, and spectacularly bucolic landscape, aren’t enough to keep you occupied, Thuringia’s terrific cuisine will certainly ert the attention. A mustard museum in Erfurt and the annual Onion Festival in Weimar (with live music and food stalls, it attracts more than 350,000 people yearly) are proof of how seriously they take their food.The Thuringian bratwurst is the culinary kingpin of the region, but you can tuck in to other hearty dishes such as the succulent Mutzbraten (grilled pork) and Thuringian dumplings, or for those with a sweeter tooth, how about some handmade chocolate? And why not wash it all down with a dark beer, for which the region is well known, or a glass of white wine from Bad Sulza in north-eastern Thuringia? Just a few more reasons why Thuringia should be firmly on the tourist map.Thuringian bratwurstLocals claim the Thuringer rostbratwurst – its full name – is the best bratwurst in Germany. The original recipe dates back to 1434, so they certainly know what they are doing. Consisting of minced pork (local variations have beef or game) mixed with marjoram and garlic, some also feature caraway seed, although its inclusion is a subject of hot debate among Thuringians. It’s traditionally grilled over an open fire and eaten on the street with a bun and mustard (ketchup is a definite faux pas), but having it with sauerkraut and potatoes is also common. Locals consume nearly three times as many bratwursts a year than the average German.Try one from a street stall, or Faust Food, an indoor food market. Still pining for sausages? Then head to the Eichsfeld region in western Thuringia for three types of air-dried sausage: runde, feldkieker (which looks a bit like a club), or the spicy stracke, and you can sample them at the Klausenhof tavern in Bornhagen.Thuringer klösseThe dumpling is a staple dish of the region and traditionally served with a Sunday roast with lots of gravy. Filling and wholesome, the local dumpling doesn’t contain flour and is made of raw grated potatoes and cooked mashed potatoes, seasoned, rolled into fist-sized balls with two or three croutons stuffed inside and then simmered in water. They go well with meat or veg, and were originally popular with the less well-off as they were cheap to make. Try them at Die Landgrafenstube Wartburg Hotel in Eisenach or, for a cheaper alternative, head to Zum Guldenen Rade in Erfurt.MutzbratenA tasty chunk of seasoned pork, which is flame grilled – traditionally over a birchwood fire. It’s served with bread, sauerkraut and mustard. Try one in Schmölln or Altenburg, in the eastern part of the state, where it is something of a speciality, or in an inn or restaurant while walking in the Thuringian Forest.Goldhelm chocolate Inspired chocolate creations are what you will find at Goldhelm Schokolade, which has two outlets in Erfurt. There’s a tiny shop on Krämerbrücke (Merchants’ Bridge), the longest inhabited bridge in Europe – it dates from the 14th century – or there’s a larger version with a lovely cafe on nearby Kreuzgasse. Using high-grade cocoa from Peru and Vietnam allows the makers to lower the sugar content. Their signature chocolate is the Bridge Truffle. They do a memorable hot chocolate too.Beers, wines and spiritsThuringia has a long tradition of brewing beer and producing wine: in the middle ages there were nearly 600 breweries in Erfurt, Germany’s oldest beer purity law was laid down in Weissensee in 1434. The region is known for its dark beers, one of the best is Köstrizter from the little town of Köstritz. Most towns have their own breweries, such as those in Weimar, Eisenach and Erfurt (head here to the Goldener Schwan, which has a wide variety of beers, including wheat and pilsner). Hikers in the Thuringian Forest should visit the Ankerla Brewery in Steinach.Oenophiles will find some fabulous white wines, too – and some very good reds – around Bad Sulza in the north-east one of the best vineyards is Weingut Zahn in Grossheringen, which has a restaurant and tours.And don’t forget to try Thuringia’s range of digestifs, or kräuterschnaps. You will find them in most bars and restaurants – look out for Aromatique, made in Neudietendorf, using spices and herbs Rhöntropfen, produced since the 1870s in the Rhön region and also made with herbs and spices, and Nordhäuser Doppelkorn, a grain brandy from Nordhausen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9425f5b81f3dc73a33d4d83278462aaa4181fd7c/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbed519ba607a04b1c62249fb1af8ea","title":"fairytale castles and secret forests discover germanys best kept secret","story":"Deep in the heart of Germany lies Thuringia – a state bursting with both cultural curiosities and unrivalled natural beautyExplore the wildernessThe 700-year-old Rennsteig trail traces a spectacular ridgeway through the Thuringian forest, and is a mecca for hikers and cyclists. Originally a trade route in the Middle Ages, the path is popular with both walkers wishing to get away for a while and cyclists up for a serious challenge. With 105 miles running from Bach’s birthplace, Eisenach, to the river Saale in Blankenstein, there is plenty to take in.Medieval wondersStrewn across Thuringia’s lush scenery are an incredible 400 castles and palaces. Queen Victoria, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha famously danced at Schloss Friedenstein, while Richard Wagner’s operatic masterpiece Tannhäuser was inspired by Wartburg Castle, now a Unesco world heritage site and home to a 9,000-strong treasure trove of European art. Erfurt, the state capital, is also worth a visit. Peek inside St Mary’s Cathedral, where the 16th century monk Martin Luther was ordained, before taking in Erfurt’s perfectly preserved medieval old town that’s most impressive.Art and cultureEver since a youthful Johann Wolfgang von Goethe arrived in the city of Weimar, flushed with success from his romantic bestseller The Sorrows of Young Werther, Thuringia has been a haven for artists, philosophers, musicians, innovators and reformers. Weimar’s numerous coffee houses were frequented by everyone from Johann Sebastian Bach to Friedrich Nietzsche, Wassily Kandinsky and Marlene Dietrich. The world-class design school Bauhaus opened in Weimar in 1919 – before moving to Dessau in 1925 – and next year’s centenary will be marked with a plethora of parties and special events, culminating in the grand opening of the new bauhaus museum weimar.Take a different viewPrize for the coolest place to see goes to the Carl Zeiss-Planetarium in Jena. The world’s oldest planetarium, built in 1926, features an impressive dome projection system where Pink Floyd and Queen provide the soundtrack to gas clouds and galaxies. And for holiday snaps unlike anyone else’s Instagram feed, visit Erfurt-Rieth: a concrete jungle of 1970s GDR architecture, complete with retro-futurist skywalks, plattenbau tower blocks, murals and sculptures.The best of the wurstIt would be remiss not to mention Thuringia’s legendary sausages – rostbratwursts, or “rosters” – which are one of the world’s most delicious things to put on a BBQ, slather in mustard and slap into a sliced roll. The marjoram and spices in these protected-designation-of-origin sausages bring them to life.

A poll at the time found that the price of fuel had become France’s biggest talking point.The movement was named “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests) because protesters wear the fluorescent yellow high-vis jackets that all motorists must by law carry in their cars. But what began as a fuel tax protest has now morphed into a wider anti-government movement.Unlike previous French protest movements, it sprang up online through petitions and was organised by ordinary working people posting videos on social media, without a set leader, trade union or political party behind it.A first national day of protests was held across France on Saturday 17 November and the protests have continued daily, including roadblocks, barricades of roundabouts and the blockading of fuel depots.The French interior ministry says the total number of people demonstrating has dropped since its peak on 17 November, when about 285,000 people demonstrated across France. On 1 December, two weeks after the first protests, the interior ministry said that at 3pm 75,000 people were on the streets. It is thought that about 100,000 in total demonstrated in France throughout the day.However, violence has escalated at the weekly Paris protests held on Saturdays. While thousands demonstrated peacefully on 1 December, about 3,000 people fought running battles with police, burned more than 100 cars, set fire to several buildings and smashed bank windows and shopfronts on some of the most expensive streets in the capital.Authorities blamed extreme-right and extreme-left “professional” rioters for infiltrating the peaceful demonstrations. The Paris prosecutor said a majority of the more than 300 people in police custody after the Paris violence were men aged between 30 and 40 who “had come to fight police while also claiming to be part of the gilets jaunes movement”.There were also violent clashes with police in Toulouse. In Le Puy-en-Velay, the local prefect’s office was petrol-bombed and briefly caught fire.Gilets jaunes protesters in other regions continue to stage roadblocks, and some fuel depots have been blocked in the north-west. Some high-school students have also now joined the movement and barricaded schools.Protesters have largely come from peripheral towns, cities and rural areas across France and include many women and single mothers. Most of the protesters have jobs, including as secretaries, IT workers, factory workers, delivery workers and care workers. All say their low incomes mean they cannot make ends meet at the end of the month.The movement is predominantly against a tax system perceived as unfair and unjust, but there are numerous grievances and differences of opinion. Most want to scrap the fuel taxes, hold a review of the tax system, raise the minimum wage and roll back Macron’s tax cuts for the wealthy and his pro-business economic programme. But some also want parliament dissolved and Macron to resign.This is the first big crisis of Macron’s presidency. The 40-year-old pro-business, pro-Europe centrist has staked his political identity on insisting he would never give in to street protests. But polls suggest he is seen as not listening to the concerns of ordinary working people on low incomes, and he is under pressure to make concessions.It is damaging that Macron – whose own fledgling political movement, La République En Marche, was styled as a grassroots movement to listen to the people – was taken by surprise by this sudden tax revolt. Although Macron beat the far-right Marine Le Pen in last year’s presidential election, the mood of distrust of the political class never went away.The question is what Macron could now offer to calm the protests and whether he now tweaks his economic policy. The first 18 months of Macron’s presidency were defined by his drive for businesses to become more competitive he has cut taxes on companies and transformed France’s wealth tax, easing the tax burden on the very wealthy.Macron is now under pressure to consider the gilets jaunes’ demands, which include scrapping the eco tax and raising the minimum wage. It is uncertain what measures the government might propose in the coming days. The economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Monday that the government should press on with lowering taxes but at the same time lower France’s high public spending.AnalysisWarnings of latest crisis facing Macron were in plain sightAre the French hit especially hard by fuel taxes?OpinionNever before have I seen blind anger like this on the streets of ParisFrance is deeply fractured.

The members are nominated every three years and it is unusual for their mandates to be cut short.Grillo did not explain the motive behind her decision and said in her post that some of the revoked board members “could be reappointed”, but “not the leaders … who must have the trust of and be in full harmony with the minister in charge”.Siliquini said Grillo had the power to sack the board, but it was unusual. “It’s also unusual that in her communication she said some can remain but not the leaders … she doesn’t name me but it’s simple to understand,” Siliquini said.Siliquini, who received a formal letter of her dismissal on Monday morning that contained no explanation, said that in the six months since Grillo became health minister the pair never met.“We’re the organisation that helps them, from a scientific and technical point of view, to make decisions on policy,” said Siliquini. “But she never asked us anything during these six months, which was probably a strong signal.”In 2013 the Five Star Movement was a vociferous supporter of Stamina, a controversial stem-cell therapy promoted by a psychologist who claimed it could perform miracles but was later proven to be a con.Grillo has also caused confusion after making several U-turns on the government’s child vaccine policy. Her party, which is governing in coalition with the far-right League, came to power pledging to reform a policy brought in by the previous administration making 10 vaccines mandatory.Grillo then said in June that parents could “self-certify” that their children had been vaccinated, instead of providing a doctor’s note, causing mayhem at the start of the school year. Then in mid-November, amid a measles epidemic, the government said it would uphold the vaccines obligation while calling for 800,000 infants, children and young adults to be injected against the virus."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3718774.1543861309!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"class gap exposed in third level progression figures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Limerick: Outside Dublin, proximity to a third-level college and socio-economic status seemed to be key determining factors in whether or not students go on to third level. Photograph: iStockClick here to download\u0026nbspthe full 2018 Feeder School tablesStudents from the most affluent parts of Dublin are up to 14 times more likely to progress to university than their counterparts from some schools in the city’s most disadvantaged areas, the annual  “Feeder Schools” supplement shows.The survey reveals that most schools in better-off parts of the city – such as Dublin 2, 4 and 6 and 14 – had progression rates of 90 per cent or more. By contrast, inidual schools in more deprived parts of the capital – such as Dublin 10, 11, 17 and 24 – had progression rates as low as 7 per cent.These figures indicate both the extent of middle-class privilege and the inequality that continues to pervade the education system despite decades of investment in deprived schools.A breakdown of figures nationally also shows that schools in the State’s most privileged areas are sending the highest number of students to university and these are taking high-points courses.Fee-paying schools continue to dominate Feeder School league tables, accounting for 17 of the top 20 schools that send the most students to college.Muckross College, a non-fee-paying all-girls school in Donnybrook, Dublin 4, had the single highest progression rate to university and high-points courses.This was closely followed by Coláiste Iosagáin, a non-fee-paying all-girls Gaelscoil in Blackrock, Dublin 4, and Sandford Park, an inter-denominational fee-paying school in Ranelagh, Dublin 6.All these schools recorded college progression rates in excess of 100 per cent. This is because students who defer college, or who repeat a year, are recorded in the same data that is compiled by third-level colleges.Disadvantaged, or Deis, schools recorded average progression figures of 57 per cent. This overall rate has not changed significantly over the past five years.Outside Dublin, proximity to a third-level college and socio-economic status seemed to be key determining factors in whether or not students go on to third level. In Galway, an average of 84 per cent of students go on to third level, with an average of 79 per cent in Cork city and county, 76 per cent in Kildare. By contrast, there were much lower progression rates in Longford (61 per cent) and Sligo (64 per cent).Schools which teach through Irish also continue to outperform many other schools with progress rates of just over 80 per cent. While they account for just 48 of the 700-plus secondary schools – about 7 per cent – they accounted for eight of the top 25 schools with the highest college progression rates."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3718748.1543859255!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"feeder schools five take aways from this year s figures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe proportion of school leavers heading to college is now edging towards 60 per cent. Photograph: iStockThe  Feeder School data published on Tuesday provides details of the educational pathways of thousands of students across almost 700 secondary schools this year.We can see the patterns of where students went on to third level and in what numbers.They do not show where students went on to further education or apprenticeships we have consistently requested this data but education authorities have not yet released it.Notwithstanding that, this year’s figures provide some striking insights into areas such as the importance of social class and geography in determining the paths of many thousands of pupils. Here are some of the key points from this year’s data: The data reveals the ongoing good news story of Ireland’s exceptionally high third-level participation rates, putting us among the highest in the world for those under 40 years of age.The proportion of school leavers heading to college is now edging towards 60 per cent.By contrast, the equivalent proportion in countries such as Germany is less than half this figure.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retention rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.Within the feeder school figures are stark differences in college participation based on social class.The most affluent parts of the capital – such as Dublin 2, Dublin 6 and Dublin 4 – saw 90-100 per cent of pupils go on to college.By contrast, more deprived areas of the city such as Dublin 17 has a progression rate of just 7 per cent (though this may be distorted by a single secondary school in the area). Dublin 10 and and Dublin 11 also had relatively low progression rates of 42-44 per cent.The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into higher points courses, which are defined as programmes in universities, colleges of education, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) or the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT).Some 80 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these institutions, compared with 4 per cent in Dublin 17 and 16 per cent in Dublin 10.Irish young people are tending to apply for third-level places in their local colleges. This is partly cultural as most Irish school leavers want to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group. But there is a growing economic factor too: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college. This is especially true for students considering Dublin, Cork or Galway for college given the accommodation crisis.A breakdown of figures on a county basis also show there are lower progression rates in counties which do not have a large third-level institution on their doorstep.In Longford, for example, 61 per cent of school leavers went to college in Galway – home to NUI Galway and GMIT – the equivalent figure was 84 per cent. 4. Affluence, rather than private schools, is a key factorMost of the schools where all students progress to third level are fee paying, but the fees are not the determinate factor.Non-fee-paying schools in the same geographic areas draw their pupils from the same social class and achieve similar participation rates. For example, the top two schools in percentage participation rates in higher points courses are Muckross College Donnybrook, and Coláiste Íosagáin Stillorgan Road, both non-fee paying schools.5. Some Deis schools performing well Schools which are designated as disadvantaged – or Deis – receive extra resources. Overall, about 57 per cent of pupils in these colleges go on to higher education.These rates have not shifted much since 2012, according to our figures.When we break down the figures to see who are the “most improved” schools over recent years, however, a great deal of schools are in the Deis category.For example, Scoil Chuimsitheach Chiaráin, a co-educational Deis school in Connemara, has seen its third-level participation rate increase from 60 per cent in 2012, to 97 per cent in 2018. These figures can, however, be distorted sometimes by falling student numbers, or pupils leaving school early, which push progression rates – temporarily – upwards.This shows the scale of challenge for both the schools involved and the Government."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3710948.1543243876!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why some schools do better than others","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“There’s a debate about how influential schools are in terms of academic success, with some studies saying it only accounts for about 20 per cent of a student’s academic achievement.” Photograph: iStockIt’s no surprise to find that schools in Dublin 4 send more students to third-level than schools in Dublin 24. Parents tend to be that bit more taken aback to find that schools in Donegal generally send more students to third-level than those in Wicklow.But why do some schools do better – in the narrow sense of sending more students on to third-level – than others? We asked education experts for their views.John MacGabhann is general secretary of the Teachers Union of Ireland. Dr Jennifer Symonds is an assistant professor at the UCD School of Education. Dr Anthony Malone is a lecturer at Maynooth University’s Department of Education. Cathy McLoughlin is head of the access service at DCU, which runs the largest university access programme in Ireland.“Why are houses bigger in Dublin 4 than in Dublin 24?” asks MacGabhann, a long-time critic of the publication of college progression data. “This is the middle-class establishment looking in the mirror and saying: ‘Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?’ They send more to third-level than others because of economic factors. Of course, the lists reflect back to them the value of their own choices.”Fee-paying schools have a particular advantage, he says. “They raise more through fees than through the Department of Education subvention. If 500 pupils are charged €6,000 per year, that gives the school a nest egg of €3 million – money that a school in the public system could only dream of – to buy additional teachers and better staffing levels, as well as more middle-management roles for the better administration of the school. It’s always been our view that, while parents have a right to send their children to fee-paying schools, our tax revenues should not be funding these exclusionary practices.”Symonds points to Irish data which show that students in disadvantaged schools still have less chance of attending college even after accounting for their attainment. She suggests one of the influencing factors could be money. “There are systemic issues: when people look for part-time work to support themselves through college, they are often restricted to low-wage, temporary and insecure jobs, so employers need to be under pressure to improve the conditions of employment.”Malone says there is mountains of evidence, dating back to the 1964 Coleman report, to show that inequality and social deprivation has a long-lasting impact on academic achievement. “The better schools are those vested in helping both students from higher and lower socioeconomic backgrounds to achieve. Supporting cultures of high expectations, wraparound supports and quality teaching and learning are all important. But there’s a debate about how influential schools are in terms of academic success, with some studies saying it only accounts for about 20 per cent of a student’s academic achievement. Family background and other social factors may be more significant.”“Ireland has long had a preoccupation with academic success,” says Malone. “The post-primary system, formally founded in legislation in 1878, was based on competition and a narrow view of achievement. If you talk to students now about how they got on in school, they’ll usually talk about their exam results, but this tells us little about the quality of their educational experience. These tables are grounded in that tradition. There is an argument that we should have as much transparency in our education system as possible, but league tables can narrow the conversation and ignore the structural inequalities in education.”Grinds and extra tuition are more easily available to students from families with disposable income, says McLoughlin. “Among access students, 97 per cent graduate with higher honours. Why didn’t they perform as well in the Leaving Cert? They didn’t have access to grinds, grinds schools, and the preparation for the exams. If they did, it might push them up a grade or two.”MacGabhann is sceptical of the idea that grinds buy better teachers. “Where’s the evidence? The grind schools claim they have the best teachers, but what is a good teacher? They’re no better than teachers in other schools. Grinds imply what the word sounds like: a type of force-feeding, compacting into notes and removing discretion to allow the student think for themselves. While they might make sense in certain circumstances – such as if a child is very ill – time spent on grinds would be better spent on independent learning and developing the critical-thinking skills that would really serve them well at college by lessening their chances of dropping out.”\u0026nbsp“Conversations about going to college start at a young age in many households,” says McLoughlin. “That doesn’t happen in every household, particularly where there is no tradition of going to third-level. If a parent has had a bad experience of education themselves, they might be more inclined to agree that Irish has no use or that maths is terrible. Immediately, certain courses are ruled out, because they may not be aware they need maths for engineering or Irish for primary teaching. There are households who may not know about how Susi could cover a lot of costs. By the time it is discussed, it can be transition year and that’s a little late to be talking about careers and aspirations.”Symonds says young people are hugely influenced by the expectations others have of them. “Having a high-quality aspiration is a powerful shaper of career pathways, and this could be for an apprenticeship or a strong vocational route – this is just as important whether the student is in a Deis school or an expensive fee-paying school. An inclusive school is about accepting everyone, including those who aspire to different pathways. College isn’t the right route for all young people, and evidence from the US shows that funnelling people down that pathway leads to higher drop-out rates.”Maths, Irish, science, technology and modern language teachers are in short supply. McLaughlin says Deis schools are having particular problems in recruiting and retaining teachers. “If you’re a teacher with a choice of jobs, you may go for a school that’s less challenging. We’re also hearing that teachers prefer jobs outside Dublin due to the cost of living in the city.”Working with colleagues, Symonds interviewed young Irish people from Dublin Deis schools about their experiences of classwork. “The majority said they were motivated to learn and found classwork meaningful. But there was a discrepancy between what was said and how some students behaved: we found about 20 per cent not concentrating because they were distracted by others, resulting in lower attainment. This can be a vicious cycle for students who are grouped into lower-attainment classes where disruptive students often coalesce.”Taking an approach which focuses on the strengths of learners, we need to look at what is happening in the classroom to prevent learning, says Symonds. “We should acknowledge that students often need a high degree of motivation to pay attention to material that’s not necessarily interesting. The system as it is privileges students who like to sit down and read and write, and doesn’t always acknowledge that adolescents seek autonomy and don’t like being told what to do.”Young people who don’t enjoy school work can quickly disengage from school, and identify as someone who doesn’t work hard or want to go to college, says Symonds. “Schools and parents that hold high aspirations for their students – vocational or academic, and link these pathways to classwork, while helping students stay focused and avoid distractions, may see better outcomes.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3717744.1543781192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"as poland hosts climate talks paris agreement looks frayed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS federal regulatory rollbacks have increased the attractiveness of investing in the dirtiest fossil fuel projects globally, while the US withdrawal from the agreement “has created moral and political cover for others to follow suit”Three years after the Paris agreement on climate change was agreed, the annual gathering of 195 signatory countries was scheduled to finalise a rulebook for delivery and to push on with implementation. The framework is the annual conference of the parties known as the COP in this case COP24 in Katowice, Poland, which opens on Monday. Governments in climate denial – under-delivery from the committed, and chilling scientific reports confirming the scale of damage to the planet from climate change– have diffused optimism. The recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report demonstrated the vulnerabilities, impacts and risks of further global warming. This is against a background of record global temperatures, rising emissions, accelerating extreme weather events and time running out to stave off worst-case scenarios.Parties are likely to agree on rules under the agreement the US excluded. This relates not only to promises by inidual states set for 2025 and 2030, but also long-term goals.The view that US president Donald Trump’s distinct brand of climate denial can be circumvented by the actions of committed US states and corporations is, however, countered by Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) analysis published on Monday which finds the “Trump effect” is slowing down the pace of global decarbonisation.Its author, IIEA research fellow Joseph Curtin, warns against downplaying the very real damage caused by it, but also against prematurely drawing defeatist conclusions about the future of the agreement. “While the agreement may be taking on water, it is a mistake to suggest that it is about to sink, or that all parties are failing to live up to their commitments,” he said. “The agreement can resist the Trump effect – it was designed to be resilient – but in the medium and longer-term it will be weakened unless the factors underpinning President Trump’s decision can be addressed in the US.” US federal regulatory rollbacks have increased the attractiveness of investing in the dirtiest fossil fuel projects globally, while the US withdrawal from the agreement “has created moral and political cover for others to follow suit”, it adds. Russia and Turkey have abandoned plans to ratify, while Australia has rolled back measures to comply with the agreement. Brazil was due to host COP25 next year but pulled out in recent days, which is being interpreted as a sign of president-elect Jair Bolsonaro’s impending war against climate action. US withdrawal has also severely damaged goodwill at international negotiations, “a vital ingredient for future progress”, the IIEA concludes. It was hoped national efforts to meet Paris pledges would catalyse faster deployment of green technologies, leading to economies of scale, reduced technology costs and positive spillovers all countries could benefit from. “This was supposed to open up space for parties to take on increasingly robust commitments every five years,” Curtin adds.Denying the importance of the Trump effect is a mistake, the report concludes, “but it is also a mistake to suggest the agreement is in crisis, or worse still, that all parties are failing to live up to their commitments”. The EU is determined to ramp up ambition and to be seen as the global leader in climate change. It has unveiled its plan to be the first major economy to go “climate neutral” by 2050 – which means any greenhouse gases emitted need to be soaked up by forest growth or new technologies removing carbon from the atmosphere. Combustion engine vehicles are to be phased out and fossil fuels cut to zero. Decarbonisation targets will be much more demanding and reliance on technological solutions more pronounced through “negative emissions” technology – essentially use of bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).This amounts to an attempt to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. It comes with recommendations rather than targets, but it is clear the plan will be a big part of the COP24 agenda. Critically for Ireland, it flags more onerous targets when the country is locked into a rising emissions trajectory. In spite of a raft of policy measures adopted to address this, next week’s Climate Change Performance Index is likely to confirm our laggard status. The EU approach “makes sense for now”, according to Erica Hope of the European Climate Foundation. Big things need to happen, she said in Dublin recently. But with uncertainty and lack of common purpose, she couldn’t help thinking of Brexit. The backdrop is “real world progress is not where it needs to be. There is clearly an emissions gap”.A core of EU countries, notably Sweden, Portugal and Denmark, strongly favour scaled-up ambition. Ireland may have flagged greater ambition but performance does not tally with that. Others with coal or diesel emissions issues regard climate action as a nuisance. Action Aid has spelt out COP24 requirements from a climate justice perspective. Rich countries must deliver on a promised $100 billion per year for climate action in poorer countries as keeping to 1.5 degrees can only be achieved through countries delivering their fair share of reductions in national emissions. “Rich countries have done most to cause climate change, yet currently poor countries are doing more than rich countries to reduce their own national-level emissions.” it added. It feared BECCs would require so much land to grow tree plantations for bioenergy it would lead to widespread hunger and deforestation. “And the fact is that this process is not even carbon neutral. It will not halt the rise in global warming.”Those concerned about lack of concrete actions at a time of great urgency hope the “Talanoa Dialogue” adopted at COP23 will compel countries to come forward with pledges to ambitiously increase current mitigation and finance targets, and communicate such improvements by 2020 thus sending a signal to other states to accelerate climate action in spite of patchy progress so far."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former president says Ireland needs to be a climate change leaderPayslips for employees and retirees account for 81 per cent of department\u0026rsquos postal costsOlivia Buckley expected to fill slot left by decision of Justin McAleese to not runLiving peatlands sequester carbon-dioxide, drawing it down from the atmosphere through plants and trapping it underground as carbonConcerns over contract price remain but officials say price would be spread out over 25 yearsDozens of doctors walked out of event claiming \u0026lsquoserious crisis\u0026rsquo over abortion servicesMove comes as party prepares to decide on confidence and supply deal extensionAmount language school owed in directors\u0026rsquo loans rose from \u0026euro153,586 to \u0026euro427,419 in 2017Peter Boylan says \u0026lsquoinevitably, there will be problems\u0026rsquo and nobody should expect \u0026lsquoperfection\u0026rsquo from serviceAdequate supports not available to teenagers entering direct provision system, says ESRIEducational inequality: \u0026lsquoFeeder Schools\u0026rsquo data shows the extent of two-tier schools systemSchools with dramatically falling numbers can have grossly inflated progression ratesWhy do some schools send more students on to third-level institutions than others?DUP describes Sinn F\u0026eacutein as \u0026lsquolittle more than glorified spectators\u0026rsquo in Brexit debateFurther education expanding to offer apprenticeship and traineeship programmes in finance and ITSchool figures also account for all students who sat the Leaving Cert in previous yearsLists should be considered alongside whole-school evaluations and subject inspection reportsNSPCC Northern Ireland says it received 19,937 calls last year about neglect of childrenSchool profile: St Eunan\u0026rsquos College, Co DonegalSchools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit teachers.

For non-teaching staff, the expected cost was €264,584.57 for 411,191 payslips.Between January 1st and April 12th last year, the department spent 57c on posting each payslip, with the cost per item rising to 67c for the period between April 13th and December 31st. The cost jumped again on April 4th last to 74c per item.A spokesman for the department told The  that the provision of a “self-service” payslip facility is part of a payroll modernisation project currently being undertaken.“There are 120,000 staff paid on a fortnightly basis on the payrolls operated by the department,” he said. “The primary objective is to ensure that the staff are paid on time and correctly.”The spokesman said there was communication and co-operation between the department and the National Shared Services Office (NSSO), which was set up in 2014 to centralise the public services payroll.However, “the vast majority of these 120,000 staff are not part of the NSSO payroll”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3719489.1543913344!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit britain can unilaterally revoke article 50 ecj advocate general","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPro-European Union (EU), anti-Brexit demonstrators wave Union and EU flags as they protest opposite the Houses of Parliament in London on December 3, 2018. Photograph: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVASAFPGetty ImagesBritain has the right to withdraw its Brexit notice from the European Union unilaterally, an advocate general of European Court of Justice said on Tuesday . The non-binding advice comes as the British parliament begins five days of debates on prime minister Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal with the EU before voting on it next Tuesday.“Advocate General (Manuel) Campos Sanchez-Bordona proposes that the Court of Justice should declare that Article 50 ... allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU,” the ECJ, the highest court, said.“That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded,” it said in a statement. While the advocate general’s opinions are not binding, the court tends to follow them in its final rulings. It was not know when it would announce its decision. Britain is due to leave on March 29th, 2019, and Ms May has agreed on an exit pact and an outline of the future EU-British ties with the other 27 EU states. But the proposed accord must yet be backed in the British parliament, where it faces stiff opposition. The case was brought before the ECJ by Scottish politicians opposed to Brexit. They hope that if the court rules in their favour, it would pave the way for a potential second referendum, giving voters the option to remain in the EU. “The decision is one that the UK can make unilaterally - without needed the consent of the other (EU) member states. That puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives,” said Jo Maugham, one of the lawyers involved in the case.

Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesTheresa May will on Tuesday appeal to MPs to back her Brexit deal at the start of five days of debate on the agreement, which is opposed by much of her own party as well as by the opposition. The prime minister will say that the deal respects the outcome of the 2016 referendum and will return to Britain control of its borders, laws and money.“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted. This is the deal that delivers for the British people,” she is expected to say.John Bercow, the Speaker, allowed\u0026nbspLabour, the DUP and four other opposition parties to lay down a motion that will be voted on Tuesday, immediately before before the start of the five-day debate on the Brexit deal.The motion, submitted late on Monday, calls on MPs to find “ministers in contempt for their failure to comply” and is signed by the shadow\u0026nbspBrexitsecretary, Sir Keir Starmer the DUP’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds and the Scottish National party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party.Attorney general Geoffrey Cox told MPs on Monday that Britain would have to remain indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop if negotiations failed to produce a free-trade deal that kept the Border open. Mr Cox was speaking after the publication of an overview of his legal advice to the government on Brexit, which followed a demand by MPs that they should see his full advice to the cabinet.“I make no bones about it, I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination of this backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit if negotiations have irretrievably broken down. But I am prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we are likely to be entrapped in it permanently,” Mr Cox said.The attorney general said that the backstop would offer Northern Ireland’s traders a competitive advantage over traders from European Union member states, including Ireland, because they could trade freely in both the single market and the rest of the UK. He suggested that, if the backstop persisted beyond a short period, it would be subject to a legal challenge in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that article 50 of the EU treaty could not be the basis of a permanent arrangement with a non-EU state.Dozens of Conservative MPs have said publicly that they would vote against the withdrawal agreement, along with the DUP and the opposition parties. But Mr Cox said that, when weighed against the alternatives to backing the prime minister’s deal, it was a risk worth taking.“This represents a sensible compromise. It has unattractive elements, unsatisfactory elements for us. But the question for the House is to weigh it up against the other potential alternatives and to assess whether it amounts to a calculated risk that this government and this House should take in these circumstances,” he said. -- Additional reporting: Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It allows thousands of women to order affordably priced products - from sanitary pads and condoms to shampoos and body lotions - on their mobile phones. Customers can order online, or those without smartphones can dial *119 to use an offline, text message based version to make purchases. The orders are then dispatched and delivered to their door in discreet packaging by moped or, in particularly remote regions, a local Kasha ‘agent’. Access to contraception“There was absolutely a gap in technology serving women and women’s needs,” said Joanna, who started the company with business partner Amanda Arch after leaving the Seattle tech bubble. “We have an e-commerce model, but we have chosen to optimise for women and underserved consumers.The approach appears to be working Kasha delivered its 100,000th order this month and has close to 20,000 customers. Products which are seen as \u0027embarrassing\u0027 to purchase in shops - including sanitary pads, condoms, HIV tests and emergency contraception - have been the most popular purchases. “We serve women across segments, from low income women in rural communities to executive women in offices,” said Dianne Dusaidi, Rwanda country director. “We’ve actually been surprised with how popular we’ve been with rural areas, we thought Kasha might just appeal to the middle classes.”Contraception use has skyrocketed in Rwanda, but stigma remainsCentral to the company\u0027s appeal is what it calls the Kasha ladies. Built on an Avon-style model, the company employs 75 women who work in predominantly rural communities, to build trust with clients and explain how e-commerce - still in its infancy in Rwanda - works. “The majority of our agents are widows, single mothers or breadwinners,” said Malyse Uwase, regional health and impact manager. “We look for women who are motivated and trusted in their community, who can talk through products and help people through the ordering process. They’re the face of Kasha.” Kasha received funding from the UK’s Department of International Development (DfID) and Unilever’s Transform programme to get started, but hopes to be profitable and self sufficient by early 2020 - and to expand across the developing world.Kasha was built to be global, said Joanna. More people should be watching the \u0027femtech\u0027 space, it has the potential to revolutionise women’s health.” Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article  Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityDepartment for International DevelopmentBrexit deal latest news: Former Bank of England governor Lord King brands Mark Carney\u0026#39s predictions implausible as he savages Theresa May\u0026#39s dealThousands of pupils could be \u0026#39disappearing\u0026#39 to illegally boost schools\u0026#39 data, Ofsted warnsComment: Voters just want Brexit done, so Remainers should be wary of trying to stop it in another voteFrench PM to announce U-turn of fuel tax hikes to end violent \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protestsWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?When does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal?

Water, another vital component to the evolution of life, may also be trapped in the asteroid\u0027s minerals.Scientists believe that asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth delivered organic compounds and water that seeded the planet for life, and atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could help prove that theory.But there is another, more existential reason to study Bennu.Scientists estimate there is a one-in-2,700 chance of the asteroid slamming catastrophically into Earth 166 years from now. That probability ranks Bennu No. 2 on Nasa\u0027s catalog of 72 near-Earth objects potentially capable of hitting the planet.Osiris-Rex will help scientists understand how heat radiated from the sun is gently steering Bennu on an increasingly menacing course through the solar system. That solar energy is believed to be nudging the asteroid ever closer toward Earth\u0027s path each time the asteroid makes its closest approach to our planet every six years.By the time we collect the sample in 2020 we will have a much better idea of the probability that Bennu would impact Earth in the next 150 years, mission spokeswoman Erin Morton said. Scientists have estimated that in 2135 Bennu could pass closer to Earth than the moon, which orbits at a distance of about 250,000 miles, and possibly come closer still some time between 2175 and 2195.Osiris-Rex reached the preliminary survey phase of its mission on Monday, soaring to within 12 miles of the asteroid. The spacecraft will pass just 1.2 miles from Bennu in late December, where it will enter the object\u0027s gravitational pull.From that stage, the spacecraft will begin gradually tightening its orbit around the asteroid, spiraling to within just 6 feet of its surface. Osiris-Rex will then extend its robot arm to snatch a sample of Bennu\u0027s terrain in a touch-and-go maneuver set for July 2020.Osiris-Rex will later fly back to Earth, jettisoning a capsule bearing the asteroid specimen for a parachute descent in the Utah desert in September 2023.NASA is developing a strategy for deflecting Bennu, or any other asteroid found to be on a collision course with Earth, by use of a special spacecraft to slam into the object hard enough to nudge it onto a safer path, said Lindley Johnson, a planetary defense officer with Nasa\u0027s Science Mission Directorate.But this is all dependent on the outcome of a very close approach that Bennu has with Earth in September 2135, Johnson said. We’ll just need to wait and see. Rather, our great-great-grandchildren will need to see. Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Former Bank of England governor Lord King brands Mark Carney\u0026#39s predictions implausible as he savages Theresa May\u0026#39s dealThousands of pupils could be \u0026#39disappearing\u0026#39 to illegally boost schools\u0026#39 data, Ofsted warnsComment: Voters just want Brexit done, so Remainers should be wary of trying to stop it in another voteFrench PM to announce U-turn of fuel tax hikes to end violent \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protestsWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?When does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal?

England’s success at the World Cup and good weather undoubtedly helped.“The chancellor’s\u0026nbspdecision in the Budget to freeze beer tax and lower business rates for thousands of pubs will make a huge difference to the viability of the sector moving forward, but Brexit looms large though, and brewers and publicans alike need certainty.”He added: “Clarity on the transition period from 29 March onwards, and a strong steer on the future relationship with the EU, would be a boost to the trade and beer sales. A no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Monday afternoon, the expiration date was no longer visible on the streamer\u0027s website, suggesting it could have been the result of a technical glitch.The Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Netflix for more information.While Netflix US has yet to officially comment on the matter, some sources appeared to confirm that the show was here to stay.NBC\u0026nbspnews senior editor Claire Atkinson said she had asked Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos about a possible removal, adding that\u0026nbspFriends\u0026nbspwouldn\u0027t be taken down in January.Wall Street Journal\u0026nbspmedia reporter Joe Flint tweeted that the date seemed to have been a mistake and that the sitcom wasn\u0027t going anywhere yet.Friends\u0026nbsparrived on Netflix UK in January 2018, three years after making its debut on Netflix US.Some such as media analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG\u0026nbsphave suggested that\u0026nbspFriends\u0026nbspmight leave netflix as WarnerMedia, the parent company of Warner Bros, gets ready to launch its own streaming platform.Warner Bros Television is the distribution company through which\u0026nbspFriends\u0026nbspis made available.Created with Sketch.The 25 best TV shows on Netflix UK Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

They took\u0026nbspurine samples in pregnancy and from the children\u0026nbspat age nine and tracked the onset of puberty.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Launching the strategy, May confirmed English GPs will be able to refer lonely people to community and voluntary activities by 2023, as she paid tribute to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned to end loneliness before her deathDr Harley added: “This is important because we know that the age at which puberty starts in girls has been getting earlier in the last few decades one hypothesis is that chemicals in the environment might be playing a role, and our findings support this idea.“Earlier puberty in girls increases their risk of mental health problems and risk-taking behaviour as teenagers and increases their risk of breast and ovarian cancer over the long-term, so this is an important issue to address.”Pesticides could wipe out frogs by turning them female, study findsHowever the report found no impact on puberty in boys. While it is not possible to say that the rising chemical levels caused this early puberty onset, rather than some other unmeasured variable that is associated with these chemical levels, experts said the study was otherwise well conducted and could be important for\u0026nbsppublic health policy makers.”The age of puberty has been advancing over the years and other factors such as ethnicity are also important contributors. The other main theory put forward for earlier onset of puberty is an increased prevalence of overweight and obese children,” said Dr Ali\u0026nbspAbbara, clinical senior lecturer in endocrinology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the research.“Generally limiting unnecessary exposure of chemicals if avoidable is sensible to avoid potential harm, however in practice this may difficult to do as they are so ubiquitously present.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That should allow people to share more personal moments with a smaller group, Instagram said.Instagram Stories has become the place to express yourself and share everyday moments, but our community has grown — sometimes what you want to share isn\u0027t for everyone, the company wrote in its announcement blog post.Instagram’s latest feature aims to tackle social media addictionInstagram had always intended for stories to be a more personal way of sharing information on the site. Not only do they disappear 24 hours after they are posted, users can see everyone who has watched them.Adding people to the list of close friends is simple: go to your profile and click on the Close Friends option in the side menu and add people. Then when you share a new story, you\u0027ll have the option of sharing only with the people in that list.Only you can see your own close friends list, people will not know from the app if they are not in it, and there is no way for people to ask to be added.\u0026nbspIf you are chosen as someone\u0027s close friend, you will see a green ring badge when you\u0027re viewing their stories, and a green ring around their profile photo in the list of stories.Close friends will be rolling out globally today on both iOS and Android, the company said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.A representative for West also told the New York Times: “Kanye was on his phone taking notes. He loved the show and was incredibly impressed by the production.”Spotify reveals its most streamed albums, artists and tracks of 2018Kanye suggests \u0027Watch the Throne 2\u0027 to Jay ZKim Kardashian: Kanye West doesn\u0027t know a lot about Trump\u0027s politicsThe incident highlights how stage actors are becoming more willing to call out poor theatre etiquette when they see it. Last week, at a preview of The Cher Show, one actor asked an audience member to stop recording her performance mid-song.Theatre critic Michael Paulson tweeted: “Did I just see @StephanieJBlock, while performing \u0027Believe\u0027 in @TheCherShow, tell a patron to stop videotaping her, without missing a step or a note? Why yes, I did.”Block then replied and said: “Yes, you did... off mic and I even said \u0027please\u0027.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad.We are psychologically and technically prepared for blast-off and any situation which, God forbid, may occur on board, said crew commander Kononenko in a news conference.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang.

We cannot change anything without breaking the law and we Brits don’t do that. We play by the rules.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the anti-Brexit European Research Group, said the paper “exposes inaccurate government spin on the proposed Brexit deal”.The most controversial issue in the withdrawal agreement is over the ‘backstop’ agreement, to set out what happens to keep the Irish border open if no trade deal is secured by the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020.Under the plan the whole UK would stay in a customs union, but the legal document released on Monday confirms that this set up would continue to apply “unless and until it is superseded” by a subsequent agreement.It later goes on: “The agreement does not contain any provision on its termination.“In the absence of such a provision, it is not possible under international law for a party to withdraw from the agreement unilaterally.”The advice also confirms that the UK faces making additional payments to Brussels if the Brexit transition period is extended.Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement it is due to run until the end of December 2020 but can be extended by up to two years if both sides agree.The advice says that discussions on any extension would involve “reaching further agreement on the UK’s financial contribution”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But I think unless the Attorney General does a U-turn, I\u0027m afraid that he is very much in the firing line.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you the latest updates throughout the day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

It is not going to be straightforward.”Russia has been accused of interfering in western politics, including the US presidential race which put Donald Trump in the White House, the elections in France and Germany and referendums on Brexit and Catalan independence.\u0026nbspSecurity cooperation with Europe ‘imperative’, MI6 chief saysBut while there have been accusations of Beijing’s industrial espionage in the west, direct action has so far come from neighbouring countries. Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from providing 5G on grounds of national security.In only his second public address in four years as “C”, in charge of MI6, Mr Younger warned of the threat of technological espionage and “malign activity” by foreign powers.He said: “Our approach to attaching a cost to malign activity also applies to cyber attacks, as in March this year when the UK attributed responsibility for the NotPetya attack against Ukraine, which also affected the United Kingdom, to the Russian government.“Much of the evolving state threat is about our opponents’ increasingly innovative exploitation of modern technology. So simply put, we’ve got to innovate faster than they can. Indeed, future generations would not forgive us if it were otherwise.”We’ve got to innovate faster than they can. Indeed, future generations would not forgive us if it were otherwise“The need is to ensure that technology is on our side, not that of our opponents,” Mr Younger continued, describing how it had helped expose the Russian spies who allegedly poisoned former MI6 agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the Noivichok attack in Salisbury.“The digital era has profoundly changed our operating environment. Bulk data combined with modern analytics make the modern world transparent, a fact which contributed to GRU embarrassment after the Salisbury attack. But it is also a serious challenge if used against us,” he said, speaking at St Andrews University, where he studied economics and computer science before joining the British army and then MI6.“Cyber is now our fastest-growing directorate. We are shifting our focus to the nexus between humans and technology.“And for the first time, through the National Security Strategic Investment Fund, we are pursuing a completely different type of partnership with the tech-innovation community, giving the private and academic community the role we need and they deserve.”“Ironically, the most profound consequence of the technological challenge is a human one. We are determined to attract people with even higher levels of technical skill to join our ranks. But my organisation will need to adapt even faster if it is to thrive in the future. And that will require people with new perspectives, capable of harnessing their creativity in ways that we can’t yet even imagine.”Mr Younger also spoke about controversies surrounding two of Britain’s closes allies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and UAE, over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the imprisonment of the British academic Matthew Hedges.The MI6 chief called the killing of Khashoggi, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October as “horrible” and\u0026nbsp“absolutely barbaric” and wanted to stress that there should be a “full and transparent investigation into what happened”.On the jailing of Mr Hedges, Mr Younger said he was “perplexed” by claims of the UAE authorities that he was a British spy. “I genuinely can’t understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to support its ally President Bashar al-Assad, while Israel has carried out frequent air strikes to prevent the supply of weapons to Hezbollah through the country.But as that conflict has wound down, both sides appear to be turning their attention to Lebanon, where analysts have long warned that another round of conflict is brewingIsrael criticised for picture of F-35 stealth jet flying over BeirutHezbollah, a Shia militant group and political party with a presence in the Lebanese parliament, has boasted of growing significantly stronger as a result of its involvement in the Syrian war.It has made no secret of its extensive tunnel network in southern Lebanon, which it says is to deter Israel from attacking it.\u0026nbspIn\u0026nbsp2015, a report by\u0026nbspLebanese newspaper As-Safir, known for its pro-Hezbollah stance, published a detailed report on the group expanding its tunnel-building efforts.\u0026nbspThe group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has claimed to have built up an arsenal of longer-range and more accurate missiles than when it last fought Israel in 2006 from its main backer Iran. Speaking last year, he said there would be “no place that is out of reach of the rockets of the resistance or the boots of the resistance fighters.”Israel, too, has been making preparations for a future conflict. Earlier this year it began building a large wall along the border, which has never been internationally recognised. And as recently as September, the Israeli army conducted large-scale drills in northern Israel simulating a conflict with Hezbollah.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

However, even with their advancements in Syria, they seem to be taking things quite slowly,” he added.The Israeli army spokesman said the tunnels posed\u0026nbspan imminent threat to Israeli civilians, and constituted a flagrant and severe violation of Israeli sovereignty. It added that the task force responsible for dealing with the tunnels was set up in 2014, and has vast abilities and knowledge on Hezbollah’s attack tunnel project.The Israeli operation began hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0026nbspmet with\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspSecretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels,\u0026nbspin which the two discussed ways to halt together Iranian aggression in the region. The administration of President Donald Trump has taken a significantly more aggressive stance towards Iran and Hezbollah than his predecessor.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt is unlikely that the operation to block off the tunnels will set off a wider\u0026nbspconflict, but the border has proven to be volatile in the past.\u0026nbspThe last major battle between the two sides was sparked by a cross-border raid\u0026nbspby Hezbollah in 2006 to kidnap two Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah had hoped to use the soldiers as to pressure Israel to release Lebanese prisoners, but it instead prompted a devastating Israeli attack that led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians. Forty four Israeli civilians were also killed by Hezbollah rockets.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHezbollah was founded in the early 1980s\u0026nbspwith the support of Iran, and spent much of its early existence fighting Israeli troops who were occupying southern Lebanon.Israel invaded Lebanon numerous times during the country\u0027s 1975-1990 civil war. During that conflict, Hezbollah dug extensive tunnel networks across southern Lebanon and used them to launch ambushes and move around unseen by\u0026nbspIsraeli jets. Today, it is possible for tourists to visit one part of that tunnel network, which has been preserved in a museum near the town of Mleeta.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452678557.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds weirdest homes","story":"His unique house is one of six featured in a new documentary, The Worlds Weirdest Homes.The Channel  show sees architect and presenter Charlie Luxton travel to far-flung destinations such as Arizona in the US, Dubai and Rio de Janiero to meet people who have chosen to live somewhere unusual.From the entrepreneur who lives on a version of Noahs Ark - complete with wooden beasts - to the scientists living on an exact replica of Mars, Sun Online takes a look at some of the most bonkers places people call home.Name: The Private ZooLocation: DubaiWho lives there  Rashed BelhasaThe son of billionaire UAE construction tycoon, Sa Ahmed Belhasa, Rashed is used to flaunting his luxurious lestyle online, posting several videos from the room he has just to house his growing trainer collection.But nothing has drawn attention as much as his impressive private zoo in the grounds of his dads opulently-decorated mega mansion.Rasheds collection of living beasts includes lions, tigers, panthers, leopards, cheetahs, giraffes and bears, all with pets ostentatiously named after his favourite brands - Versace, Armani and Dior.The zoo has attracted a number of celebrities, from singer Mariah Carey to Cristiano Ronaldo, Jackie Chan and Floyd Mayweather.Rashed says the younger animals get to come inside for snuggles, and claims he is the only  year old in the world with his own zoo.However, he has come under fire from people who have branded the zoo cruel, but says his father inspired him to help animals after he started taking in neglected creatures from other private zoos.We dont make profit from it, says Rashed. When I went to Kenya I saw lions dying because they only ate once a month. Here they eat every single day.Name: Mars Desert Research StationLocation: UtahWho lives there  A group of eight scientistsWith plans to eventually form a colony on Mars - and Elon Musk saying he wants to put people on the red planet by , it seems important that humans are well prepared.Thats where the Mars Desert Research Station comes in. Built in the early noughties, it is a replica space station where scientists live exactly asit were Mars,  .The base is located in the remote desert of Utah near the small town of Hanksville.The area looks very like Mars due to the barren red rock, mountains and sand, as well as similar rock types to those found on the Red Planet.The tiny base, where eight scientists live on a rotating basis, is smaller than an average London one-bed flat and features bunk beds in tiny closet-style rooms.They have just one toilet to share, and are only able to eat freeze-dried food asthey are in Space.People tell us that we are running around playing dress-up in a spacesuit, but its not like that at all, says Dr Shannon Rupert, who heads up the project.Name: Noahs ArkLocation: The NetherlandsWho lives there  Dutch entrepreneur Aad PetersIn , Johan Huibers, a Dutch Christian fundamentalist, decided to build a replica of Noahs Ark as he wanted to save humanity from sin after having a vision.Painstakingly crafted, the replica is  metres long, . metres wide,  metres high and made of steel, pine and cedar.In , Huibers sold the ark for £, to Aad Peters, an entrepreneur who wanted to sail the vessel around Northern Europe with live animals on board including camels and elephants - two-by-two of course.However, Aad was forced to concede three months later that unlike in the Biblical Story, an ark is not a suitable home for animals, so he took them off board.Theres not a lot of space...its like camping on sea, says Aad. If the wind blows it and youre lying shivering under five blankets you wonder am I stupid  but it is what it is. If you choose to do something you have to do it.Last year, he collided with a few other boats during a storm, and its also caught fire.At present, it is currently anchored by a car park and is a museum filled with wooden animals, but Aad says he plans to sail the high seas once it is repaired.Name: Sandcastle HouseLocation: Rio de Janeiro, BrazilWho lives there  Marcio Mizael MatoliasSea views are desired by many of us - and Rio de Janeiro resident Marcio Mizael Matolia has found a nty way to get a prime spot without the hefty price tag.For the past  years, the self-styled King of the Castle, who is adorned with a plastic crown, has lived inside his sandcastle.He says the seat outside is his pulpit, where he sits for people to come and pay respect to him and donate money to him to help him live in his strange structure.The impressive creation, in an exclusive neighbourhood surrounded by luxury flats worth millions, has  turrets, which he made by hand using sand, drtwood and water.However, though it looks great from the outside, Marcios living space is a six metre square room held up by a wooden frame.I dug a hole, then put some wood underneath so it didnt sink, says Marcio. Its a real work of architecture and engineering.Unsurprisingly, there are some setbacks with this set up. He doesnt have amenities such as a toilet so he uses public loos when he needs a poo and wees in the sea.In the rainy season his castle washes away, meaning it needs constant repairs. It takes between six and eight hours to make a couple of towers, so he can find this incredibly frustrating.Name: Freedom CoveLocation: British Columbia, CanadaWho lives there  Wayne Adams and Catherine KingThe pair have lived on the secluded farm, which floats on the ocean and weighs  tonnes - the same as a ship - for  years.The home, which is anchored to shore using lines like a giant spiders web, boasts huge areas of garden, a multi-coloured house, art gallery, dance floor and even a lighthouse.Its here that Catherine grows fruit and vegetables while Wayne, who built all of Freedom Cove himself, creates additions to their home in his workshop. The pair also fish from a hole in the floor.However, the house has regularly suffered from severe storm damage as its built in an area known for high winds.The pair say the roof has blown off several times, and ious sections of it have been completely destroyed at times.Name: Falcons NestLocation: Prescott, ArizonaWho lives there  Tarot readers Ernst and SrishtiErnst and Srishti often ran around the countryside near their home in Arizona, dreaming of owning the very peculiar building theyd go past.Falcons Nest towers at over ft high and with  floors, is the tallest single-family home on the planet. It was out of the couples price range at £.million- but an accident last year changed everything.The sporty pair were out on one of their regular runs when they were run over by a pick-up truck.Their insurance payout meant they would be in a position to buy it and they jumped at the chance.With stunning views over Arizona, the main living area has , square feet of space all the way up on the sixth floor.However, it takes a lot of maintenance: two days to clean all  windows using a special brush as they are so high up, and several people in the town complained about the building, calling it an eyesore.And the couple also admit their unusual abode attracts a lot of attention, with people pulling up outside in the cars to take photos on a regular basis.Our home is a tourist attraction, they tell Charlie Luxton.Thats certainly something you can say for all these other unusual buildings too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party. Hammond himself declares rental income of more than £,.In , the Tories were more popular than Labour among those who rented in the private sector.But at the last election, ­Labour had a -point lead over the Tories among private renters.The Tories won’t win these voters back by dragging their feet on measures that make le easier for tenants.SENIOR Labour figures are plotting a route to an early General Election that doesn’t involve having to get two thirds of the Commons to vote for it.One close ally of Jeremy Corbyn in the Shadow Cabinet tells me that the plan would be to defeat the Government in a confidence motionthe ­Government loses the meaningful vote.The idea would be to persuade the DUP to join with Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the Government. This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM is in Buenos Aires rightly extolling our virtues to world leaders, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that her Cabinet are afraid that Britain cannot make it on its own. That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late. If the PM loses the crunch vote in Parliament, we must step up preparations to leave without a deal by several notches.And that might well see Brussels bureaucrats, for all their harsh words, coming back to the negotiating table.The disgraced tycoon Max Mosley, via his family trust, has pledged to keep funding this so-called independent body for years to come, as he continues his vendetta against the free Press.Labour donor Mr Mosley is no fan of the papers, and not just for exposing his extra-curricular activities. The media also uncovered his racist past, including pamphlets warning: “Coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.”When that bile came to light, the Labour Party promised not to take another penny from him. But he’s spent years bankrolling their Deputy Leader Tom Watson’s office to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds.Isn’t it time the cash was handed back, Mr Watson Ms Bibi, a Pakistani Catholic, was acquitted last month of blasphemy charges — a charge which had left her on death row.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is something we are seeing worldwide, not only in Africa.”Brandford said in the elephant case the unit treating the elephant was the DSWT KWS Tsavo Veterinary Unit, headed by KWS Vet, Dr Poghon.He explained despite the deep impact of the spear tip, the skull makeup of the huge animal helped her survive the injury.He said: “If you took a cross section of an elephant’s skull it would appear like honeycomb.It is basically to reduce weight, because elephant skulls are so large, and need to be for the ears, trunk and of course tusks, they cannot be too heavy.“They have this sponge-like structure, and fortunately for this elephant, that is where the spear landed.“Of course, much deeper, or further down, could have been a dferent matter, hitting an eye for example.”Brandford added that the treatment of the elephant was a good example of persistence paying off.A lion was also on the receiving end of a spear attack a year ago, and these images show just how close it had come to death.As the lion lay on the ground sedated, a huge two-metre spear can be seen sticking out of his face just below the right eye.According to the DSWT, human-wildle conflict is one of the most pressing threats facing Africa’s wildle."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000453588667.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"52ft christmas tree planted 40 years ago","story":"Avril Rowlands and her husband Christopher stuck a ft fir in their front garden after enjoying their first Christmas at their new home in .Now the tree towers above their four-bedroom detached house and the couple have to hire a cherry picker to decorate it using more than , lights.And on Sunday, the couple celebrated the monster firs th anniversary when they switched on the lights.It now illuminates the entire street where the couple live in Inkberrow, Worcs.Retired TV writer Avril, , said: The switch-on event has become an absolute institution for the village and we have hundreds of people see the tree.Weve even had tourists coming from as far as China to have their pictures taken by the tree.It is amazing to think that the tree started as a ft tall sapling which we bought for just £.I remember after that first Christmas thinking to myself that I didnt want to just throw the tree out so I planted it in the front garden.It took straight away and every year its just grown taller and taller.It now takes , to light the tree, I dont look at the electricity bill until after Christmas.The couple moved to the quiet village in the summer of  after selling their home in London.And their annual switch-on event has become a local institution which raises thousands of pounds for charity.Retired BBC editor Christopher, , said: A lot of people in the village say that its the start of their Christmas.We usually raise about £, a year for charity, a dferent one each year - this year all the money is going to the Midlands Air Ambulance.Over the last  years weve raised over £, for charity.Were delighted the tree has spread so much happiness and raised so much money.We expect itll be for many years to come.Inkberrow is one of a handful of villages in the country which doesnt have any street lights and the tree can be seen from a mile away at night when it is lit up.A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said: This is a remarkable tree which has obviously been taken care of.Pine trees can grow to huge heights so time will only tellthis one grows any larger."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000453586368-e1543850306573.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"stunning secluded mansion with its own peninsula in devon goes on the market for 10m","story":"Gurrow Point, known as one of the finest homes in the south west,  is a s mansion that overlooks the glorious River Dart in Devon.Nestled near the village of Dittisham, the six-bedroom property has its own tennis courts, sauna and its own three-bedroom cottage on the grounds.The secluded home is ideal for water-loving families as it has two slipways and a jetty providing direct access to one of Britains best sailing estuaries.Unsurprisingly, the current owners rent their property out for weddings - allowing couples to say I do in the beautul surroundings.The property has been modied and extended over the years and now has , sq ft of accommodation.It has a reception hall, drawing room, sitting room, study, dining room, orangery, kitchen breakfast room, conservatory, library, billiard room, sauna, six bedrooms, five bathrooms and a two-bedroom staff flat which has its own entrance.There is also a triple garage and workshop, large barn, boules court and croquet lawn.Sarah-Jane Bingham-Chick, from Savills, said: This property takes your breath away.

I’ve never seen anything more desperate”.In a series of tweets, a Green party candidate claimed he had overheard the Cabinet Minister blast Mrs May and Cabinet colleagues over lunch yesterday.The candidate - Zak Polanski - said Ms Truss believed the PM was the “only person worse at managing people” than David Cameron – and called her a “pacist”.He claimed she predicted Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt were favourites to take over.She was reported to have said the Home Secretary “needs to be really ready to deal” with a vote of confidence and that he could “send a warning shot”.Ms Truss allegedly said the PM “should have used Michael [Gove] more when making the deal with the EU – but added: “Everyone hates him”.The Treasury wasn’t immediately available for comment last night.During a TV interview yesterday, the PM signalled she was ready to fight on in Noshe loses the landmark vote.Asked on ITV’s This Morning programme whether she would still be Premier after it, Mrs May said: “I will still have a job in two weeks’ time”.She also implored MPs to “hold their nerve”.Today, she will also tell the Commons that her deal “takes back control of our borders, laws and money”.The PM will argue: “The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted”.The Commons will debate Mrs May’s deal for a total of  hours over the following week, eight hours on each day, with almost every MP expected to speak.Every Government big gun will be brought to bare, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt speaking on Wednesday, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox addressing the chamber on Thursday.Mr Javid and No insisted the meaningful vote will take place next Tuesday despite The Sun’s report yesterday that whips discussed postponing it.Mrs May was given a rare boost when a former Brexit minister who was bitterly critical of her negotiation revealed he has decided to back the deal.Despite once dubbing it “a gangplank into thin air”, Lord Bridges wrote for the ConservativeHome website: “If you want to be sure that Brexit happens, however much you might dislike this deal, there is only one course of action – vote for it.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I knew her for about a year and a half.“I got on really well with her and then “bang” she met someone more important and immediately ghosted.“I never heard from her ever again and the old slippery slope ladder had gone up and she social climbed her way out of my orbit.“So my experience wasn’t great, I’ve got to be honest with you. And everything I’ve seen since does slightly smack of an actress, a Hollywood actress, seizing her chance and acting her way to the top.”But journalist Radhika Sanghani hit back and described Piers’ comments as being “absolutely ridiculous”.She said: “As a normal person, to me it is this really lovely love story between them.“When you saw their wedding it was very obvious they were in love and they seem a great married couple.“But unfortunately, with this media narrative we’re seeing now, it’s completely changed.”Author Tom Bower, who wrote a book on Prince Charles, said Meghan is a “victim of her own ambition”.He said: “I don’t think anyone is out to get her, I think she’s a victim of her own ambition.People are unhappy – they always leak. That’s what Piers and I live on - the victims, coming forward and confessing their unhappiness.“She’s trying to be Diana, trying to adopt the new role. The tragedy is that it will end in the same way unless someone steps in from the palace and says this is the way it’s done here.”Piers also said Meghan is very dferent to Kate Middleton, who he described as being very home counties and safe.He added: Kate Middleton is very “home counties” and safe, almost groomed for the role - it’s much easier for everybody to have that kind of person.“Meghan is from a very dferent background, a TV star, and probably finds the Palace system very suffocating and annoying.“And the people around her like the formality of it and probably equally find her annoying.”Mr Bower added: “The problem is there’s never been in the Palace someone who is really intelligent who is respected who can step forward and say look Meghan, this is how you may have done it in Hollywood, but here in London we do it this way.“You wrote that she deserves privacy. She doesn’t, she’s on public display and when you’re on public display   there’s a certain way of behaving.”Piers added: “You can’t go after a prince as she did. And I know she did. I put her in the cab to Harry to start with.“You can’t set your sights on a prince to this country who is in line to the throne and expect to have a normal private le afterwards.“It’s part of the deal. To live in Palaces at our expense you get to be in the papers. Good, bad and ugly.“I would say predominately positive coverage, a few negative stories recently.“I would say there are concerns in the Palace over her treatment of her father. It’s probably an ongoing massive issue.

Alice Muir was so ashamed of her “mountain-sized” spots that she would spend almost two hours covering them up with foundation, before events like her work Christmas party. The -year-old wouldnt even let her own family see her without a full face of make-up as she was so self-conscious. But after years of hunting for a cure - trying everything from antibiotics to expensive specialised potions - in May this year Alice, of Edinburgh, Scotland, combined a diet overhaul with a high street toner and within six weeks her skin was completely clear. Alice, who works for a luxury beauty retailer and now has a pimple-free complexion, said: “People honestly don’t believe it’s me now when I show them my ‘before’ photos.   “My acne was all over my face and was bright red and sore all the time. “I like to show customers who are having issues with their skin, to make them see that they’re not alone and things do get better.” Alice, who is single, was battling with cystic acne - the most severe form of the spotty skin condition, which occurs when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles, causing a rash of infected boils. Ironically, it was training for the job she loves so much that triggered her problems when, after leaving school, aged , she started studying make-up artistry at Edinburgh College - practising the looks she had been taught at home, using heavy make-up on her own face. “I was practising at home at least three nights a week, applying really heavy make-up, so I could then take photos and post them on my social media, to show what Id done,” she said.   “I’d apply foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, blusher and highlighter, before Id even added my eye make-up.” Until then, Alice had been blessed with clear skin and, preferring a natural look, to being heavily made-up, she was often complimented on her fresh complexion. “People would ask me, ‘Why don’t you have any spots ’. Most people of  did, but I didn’t seem to have any problems,” she said. That all changed a month into her new course, when she noticed blemishes popping up and her pores opening - making her skin more prone to break-outs. Recalling how the blemishes became bigger and angrier, she continued: “They were actually under the skin, so I couldn’t pop them. They were just there, like mountains on my face. Alice was even more mortied at college, when her fellow students had to make her face up for her, and started to wear cover-up all the time.   “Not even my own family saw me without a full-face of make-up when the acne got really bad,” she said. “It would take me up to one-and-a-half hours every day to just put my full face on. Her doctor prescribed a series of lotions, creams and antibiotics, in a bid to improve her skin, following her cystic acne diagnosis, aged , but nothing seemed to work. “I realised it was the make-up I was applying on my course that had started the terrible acne, but there seemed to be nothing I could do about it,” she recalled. When she landed her current job, following her two-year course, Alice felt ashamed of her acne-covered skin when she was applying clients make-up and helping them to choose expensive skincare products. She said: “I was supposed to be advising people on how to care for their skin and which make-up to use, but they must have been looking at me thinking, ‘Sort out your own skin before giving me advice’.   “No one ever said that to me, but I was sure that was what they were thinking. The terrible thing was there was nothing I could do about it.” On a long waiting list to see a dermatologist and refusing to take the strong acne drug Roaccutane, which slows down the amount of oil your skin releases but according to the NHS can also have a serious side effect of depression, Alice felt helpless. “I knew I had to do something. I was desperate and felt horrendous about myself,” she said. “I didn’t want to go out and dreaded events like the work Christmas party or my graduation, as I didn’t want people looking at me. “I hated looking in the mirror and didn’t recognise the girl looking back at me, I felt disgusting.” So, in May this year, Alice decided to take the issue into her own hands.   After being given a sample at work of the brand REN’s Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic, Alice says she noticed a change in her skin just a week after using it. As well as using the pound skincare treatment every night, Alice also overhauled her diet, cutting down on carbohydrates and following a ‘clean eating’ plan, eating mainly plant-based foods. Now, six months on, Alice’s skin is beautully clear, without a pimple in sight. Before she was cured Alice had not even allowed her family to see her spotty skin barefaced, but now she is releasing her photos in a bid to raise awareness about adult and cystic acne. She said: “It can happen to anyone, and it’s not because you’re not clean or you don’t wash. “At the work Christmas party this year, I won’t feel ashamed of how I look. Instead, I’ll feel proud of how far I’ve come, and, who knows, I might even get a cheeky kiss under the mistletoe.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents queue 4am freezing weather","story":"NewsParents queue from am in freezing weather to get children breakfast club placesDozens of mums and dads at Pontprennau Primary School, Cardf, queued on Monday morning to secure one of just  placesShareCommentsByThomas DeaconKelly-Ann Mills:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video parents-line-up-freezing-conditions-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParents desperate to secure their childs place at a school breakfast club queued in freezing weather from am this morning. Dozens of mums and dads at Pontprennau Primary School, in Cardf, were seen with camping chairs, blankets and Thermos flasks as they waited to secure one of just  places. The school said the plans were put in place after consulting parents and they received no complaints when they were announced in October. One mum of a pupil at the school, who did not want to be named, told Wales Online: The last time they said we could email in on a one by one basis. But people complained that they could not use email. Now we have gone back to the dark ages.   The mum said parents were calm as they queued amid cold and wet weather. She said: Its just awful. Im not well at the moment anyway, I really didnt need it. It was freezing cold. People had Thermos flasks and blankets on the floor. People had really thought out their plans. The schools breakfast club has space for  children. Half of them are paid for places which have an earlier opening time and cost pound a day. Parents will have to sign up again in July for the following September term. The mum added: You pay all this money and its this dficult. Its incredibly frustrating. If you dont get a place you have to reallocate your child care or change your work hours. Pontprennau Primary School said registration for the places opened at .am, as planned and advertised, but the school opened the building earlier so parents queueing could come inside out of the wind and rain. A school spokesperson said: This process for breakfast club registration has been put in place after the school consulted with parents on how they would like it to work. The results of the consultation showed that the favoured option amongst parents was a queuing system, with places allocated on a first come, first served basis. The school didn’t receive any complaints from parents when these new arrangements were communicated to them in October. Like most primary schools, Pontprennau’s breakfast club is extremely popular with parents but we only have so many places available, which unfortunately does mean that some families will miss out. Therefore, a system has to be put in place to allocate those places. The school will continue to monitor the process, and continue to listen to all its parents, to ensure the system is as transparent and as fair as possible. They added any parents with concerns can contact the school and speak to a member of staff. In July more than  parents at another Cardf School, Ysgol Y Berllan Deg in Llanedeyrn, queued from am to make sure they had a space at their breakfast club.

Lawyers for Paul Worthington are claiming a coroner “overstepped the mark” when he included signs of sexual abuse in the record of her death – even though she suffocated in bed. Mr Worthington, who refused to answer questions about how Poppi died  times, wants the reference to her internal injuries deleted from the findings. The ex-supermarket worker has taken his case to the High Court in Manchester, where it is not knownhe has legal aid.   Poppi’s mum, who cannot be named, is said to be devastated that he is refusing to accept the coroner’s findings on the December  tragedy . Fiona McGhie, a lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing the mum, said: “The years since Poppi died have been a complete nightmare for her. “It is likely that she may never get full closure on exactly what happened that night.”   Ms McGhie said the mum understood Mr Worthington, , was entitled not to answer questions at the inquest. But she added: “She considers that the coroner’s inquiry was frustrated by this. She is now disappointed that he has challenged the coroner.” The inquest heard -month-old Poppi died in an “unsafe sleeping environment” in her father’s bed at the family home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.  Cumbria coroner David Roberts ruled that she had suffered internal injuries but that these were not the cause of her death, which was asphyxia. Mr Worthington, who was never charged with any offence after police botched an investigation, is now in hiding.   Leslie Thomas QC, representing him, told the High Court the coroner was wrong to include a mention of the injuries because the record should only detail how the child died. He said: “It is perfectly clear this was an asphyxia death. He has overstepped the mark.” But Samantha Leek QC, representing the coroner, said: “She came by her death because she is brought into bed to be harmed. It would be completely articial to leave that out.” Mr Justice Hickinbottom said he would reserve judgment.

He said: “We have overrun it in a way that is unprecedented.

Two thirds of those polled admit they often get confused about when to say ‘could’, ‘should’ or ‘would’ have, while a fth also don’t understand the dference between using the words ‘fewer’ and ‘less’. ‘Me’, ‘myself’ and ‘I’ also causes problems for some  per cent of folk, while others are baffled about abbreviations such as i.e. and e.g. Basic punctuation can also leave some adults scratching their heads, with  per cent unable to use speech marks correctly,  per cent not really understanding where or when to place a question mark and  per cent clueless about apostrophes. But despite the results of the OnePoll study three quarters of adults think they are good at writing, and  per cent think they have a good knowledge of the English language. Gyles Brandreth added: “The survey is a wake-up call.” “Good English matters. Proper punctuation and correct spelling are essential to good, clear, effective communication - and this survey shows things ain’t as they should be. “People are making too many spelling mistakes - with new words as much as with old ones. And in the age of the email and the tweet they are confused about punctuation. “Teachers need to do more to help children understand the basics. And in a post-Brexit world, our use of English matters more than ever. It’s the English language that gives us our global clout. It’s the one language the whole world speaks. “There are now more people speaking English as a second language than as a first - and some of them are speaking and writing better English than we are.” TOP  WORDS BRITS STRUGGLE TO SPELLFluorescent Conscience Liaison Pronunciation Accommodate Rhythm Possession Stationary Maintenance RecommendTOP  WORDS BRITS MUDDLE UPLicense and licence Stationary and stationery Complement and compliment Their, there and theyre Accept and except To, two and too Ensure and insure Desert and dessert Council and counsel Bare and bear"},{"url":null,"title":"uks youngest instagram influencer bagged","story":"NewsUKs youngest Instagram influencer has bagged £, of freebies aged ONERalphie Waplingtons mum Stacey Woodhams has banned family members from sharing pictures of the tot, in order to protect his imageShareCommentsByRosaleen Fenton:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsRalphie with his parents, Stacey and Adam, at their home in Essex \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA one-year-old baby has proved so popular as an Instagram star that he has already bagged more than pound, of freebies. Ralphie Waplington is in heavy demand from brands desperate to have him model their products. Each picture on his Instagram account - which has more than , followers - shows him without a hair out of place, and his mum has banned family members from sharing pictures of him. Mum-of-one Stacey Woodhams, who runs the account, has landed a bumper crop of freebies from sharing posts of the little boy, including his entire wardrobe, bedroom furniture and days out. And she says she’s even keen to have another baby - so the child can tap into Instagram’s huge market for newborn ‘influencers’ now that Ralphie is too old. Stacey admits that she’s received hate mail and threats from fellow mothers online and warns parents that they shouldn’t run Instagram accounts for their children unless they’re prepared for the gut-wrenching backlash.   But Ralphie can make hundreds of pounds from a single sponsored post and has a dferent pram for every day of the week, all sent to him for free, infor a photograph. Stacey, from Brentwood, Essex, who styles all his outfits and snaps photos with her smartphone, says she has landed more than pound, worth of freebies for her star child. The -year-old originally set up an Instagram account for Ralphie when he was seven days old so that their family could see him grow. But within a month, she had amassed more than , followers and now spends hours every day focusing on Ralphie’s account.   She credits the social media giant for giving her the opportunity to work from home as she earns enough from running the account alongside her own business Mummas Prints. After a slew of adoring comments on his photographs, she realised that her son could become an ‘influencer’, opening up chances to work with brands and companies. As a family, Stacey, Ralphie, and his dad Adam Waplington, , have enjoyed free trips to theme parks, posh meals and popular tourist highlights, including Peppa Pig World. She earns a salary from his posts which she says she spends on family days out and treats for her boy. On top of his income from Instagram, the tot, who turns two in December, also earns a salary from modelling for brands including Next, which is kept separately in his own bank account.   Stacey said: “I’ve worked really hard to achieve what we have achieved and everything I do is for Ralphie and his future. “If a photo of him in a tracksuit with snot running down his face and his hair is messy gets put on social media, that is not representative of the brands we are representing. “It sounds awful referring to him a brand because he is a human and a child but essentially, the name that we have created is a business. “And that’s what I’m trying to say to people when they bash me, this is a business. “It’s not dferent to me leaving the house at am and ing at pm but instead I have a job where Ralphie reaps the rewards and I get to spend all day with my son. “So our family aren’t allowed to post photos unless it’s a photo we’ve already posted or a photo I’ve approved. “And before I take any photographs, we’ll make sure his hair is brushed. It’s about giving him a bit of dignity, after all I wouldn’t post a photo of me not at my best!   “One lady had a go at me saying I was too busy taking photos of him posing as a model. “Well, he is a model. He’s represented by an agency, he does a lot of modelling and he’s worked with some really big names. “So yes, I do take photos where he looks lovely because he is!” Stacey makes sure she plans ahead so photos of Ralphie are strategically shared when they’re likely to receive the most attention. She says this includes posting photos at am when fellow frazzled parents are likely to be scrolling through their phone whilst their children keep them awake. Overall, Ralphie’s received more than  free outfits, as well as free bedroom furniture, free designer toys and eight prams sent by baby brands. And Stacey and Adam have received free meals including a lavish afternoon tea at Fortnum  Mason, treatments at salons and gts including a free set of luggage and a free kingsize mattress.   Stacey said: “We’ve been invited to days out at themes parks, we’ve been offered hotel stays, a furniture company gave us all of Ralphie’s bedroom furniture. “I’ve been sent handbags, suitcases, Hugo Boss designer clothes. We got a luggage set for all of us. “Ralphie is really lucky. All of his clothing comes from Forever Sewing, they sponsor his wardrobe, and we love working with small businesses. But his profile didnt become a viral sensation overnight, as Stacey says she spent months ensuring that regular daily uploads saw her gain followers. She says she works hard to portray the daily struggles of motherhood rather than presenting a le that many cannot relate too. However, the effort was worth it, as the mum says Ralphie earns up to pound per sponsored post. But while most fans praise the handsome toddler and are quick to praise Stacey for her hard work, others aren’t so quick to big the tot’s Instagram page up. In the past, she’s received messages accusing of neglecting her son in favour of taking photographs of him. Stacey said: ‘I definitely put on a front so when someone calls you a bad mum, it really does hurt me.   “I just think thatsomeone was doing what I do but wasn’t in the right frame of mind, I wonder what these Instagram trolls could do. “I think people don’t realise the nastiness of what they say and how it could affect someone.” Although she admits to having spent a lot of time on her phone, she insists that Ralphie never notices. She says: “It only take a split second to take a photograph and I do all the editing when he’s asleep or Adam is home. “There’s a lot of prep work. You can only photograph himhe’s in a good mood and he’s happy to play. “I never force him to sit still, I just snap him in the moment so he’s none the wiser and it’s just like any other mum capturing a photo.   “He’s at that age where we can explain to him what we’re doing. “Obviously its stressful because you have a brief from some brands to get it from a certain angle and just one shot to do it. “Once you set it up,he messes it all up, then you won’t get a good image. So we really do have to work as a team. “I’ve got Adam running around like a performing monkey distracting him but Ralphie just laughs and thinks its funny. “We’ve visited some great places and he’s actually having a lot of fun but for me, it’s like being at work, “So I’m filming, editing and doing Instagram stories on my phone and probably looking like I’m having the worst time. “So it’s not all it seems.” And as Ralphie’s following increases, Stacey says she understands why parents might criticise her. She said: “We’re exposing Ralphie to a le that’s he’s not had a choice in. He’s not been able to say ‘yes mummy’, I want to do this.   ‘Ultimately, we try and understand it from people with a negative opinion. “How we see it is, yes, there’s a lot of views and opinions on what we do and how we could be putting him in danger. “But at the same time, I know that everything we post is filtered and we want to portray him as the little boy having fun that he is. “I can see why people would think we are using him as a tool for potentially making a name for our family, and as a form of income but this isn’t the case. “But I post to inspire other people that you can achieve anything. I am an ordinary girl from a really ordinary background. “I’ve had ups and downs in my lives but I know you can achieve anythingyou work hard at it. “I feel really grateful to be given the opportunities that we have been given.” And as Ralphie gets older, brands are becoming more intrigued by the rest of the family, including Adam, who works in the wholesale restaurant business.   The pair recently set up an Instagram account focused on him and hope that he may be able to quit his full-time job in the future. Adam said: “I’m still really new to the whole thing. “We found that opportunities would come up that involved dads so we thought it was a no-brainerI got involved.” But Stacey says that she still spends a lot of time contacting brands to suggest they work with her. She said: “It’s like any business, You have to go out and get it. “I’d say seventy per cent of the work we obtain is through me reaching out to source it, and thirty per cent where we get contacted directly.” Now the -year-old has begun running workshops for fellow parents on how to use social media and promote their businesses or their own family influencer accounts. She said: “I’m so passionate about what I do “I think Instagram is quite misunderstood but it can be a really positive place to share your story. In the near future, the family hope to have another child who they can also share on Instagram. Stacey said: “Some of the companies that got in touch when Ralphie was  or  weeks old, we still are in contact with. “Unfortunately a lot of products only make things for newborns so we’re longing for baby two now so we can carry on!” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast eight inches","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: EIGHT INCHES of snow to hit Britain as temperatures plungeThe Met Office is predicting heavy rain for some areas as wild weather threatens to cause travel chaosShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video could-snow-you-live-watch-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain is set to be hit by eight inches of snow as temperatures plunge across parts of the country in a -C deep freeze.

Edith Cavell was born in the village of Swardeston, near Norwich, on  December . The eldest of four children, she was educated at Norwich High School for Girls, and then she found work as a governess. She didnt become a nurse until she was -years-old, and inspired by the experience of caring for her seriously ill father Frederick. After successfully nursing him back to health Edith applied to train as a nurse probationer at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. She went on to have an illustrious medical career both in hospitals and as a private travelling nurse. Edith worked in Shoreditch, Kings Cross and Manchester before moving to Brussels in .  There she was appointed matron of Belgiums first nursing college, and within just a few years she was an expert training nurse for three hospitals,  schools and  nurseries across the country. She also founded a medical journal, LInfirmiere, in .Outbreak of WW Edith Cavell was visiting her family in England when WW broke out in . She immediately ed to Brussels, stating that I cant stop while there are lives to be saved. Ediths school was transformed into a Red Cross hospital, and she would treat casualties of the war regardless of their nationality, or what side of the conflict they were fighting on. She was also covertly working with the Belgian resistance. While Brussels was occupied by German forces, Edith was sheltering French and British soldiers and helping them escape to the neighboring Netherlands, which was neutral territory. Its believed that she helped over  men to safety, many of whom wrote to thank her once they reached home.  Unfortunately, Ediths activities didnt escape the attention of the German authorities, and she was eventually arrested and charged with treason. She was prosecuted in a court-martial, found guilty, and sentenced to death. This provoked international outrage, and there were cries for Edith to be granted a reprieve. People argued that she should be spared death, especially given that she saved so many lives - both Allied and German - through her pioneering work as a war nurse. These cries fell on deaf ears, however, and Edith was executed by firing squad at the Tir National on  October . She was just -years-old.  Legacy After the war, Ediths body was brought back to England and laid to rest at Norwich Cathedral, where a graveside service is held annually on the anniversary of her death. There are memorials dedicated to Edith around the world, and she is commemorated by the Church of Englands calendar for saints on  October every year. In , the Nations Fund for Nurses was launched in Ediths honour, and charity Cavell Nurses Trust supports nurses, midwes and HCAs who are experiencing hardhsips. Ediths legacy of compassion, bravery and heroism lives on, and is remembered to this day. Edith Cavell facts When she was growing up, Edith had a passion for painting. She was also an extraordinarily gted French speaker. Before she moved to Brussels to work as a nurse, Edith had actually already lived there. As a young woman, she spent five years working as a governess in the Belgian capital.Edith won a medal in  for her work with typhoid patients. She also cared for those with cancer, appendicitis and eye ailments.When Edith was working to smuggle Allied soldiers out of Belgium, she was helped by Prince Reginald and Princess Marie of Croy - members of the Belian aristocracy.It is believed that Edith was betrayed when a Belgian spy discovered a secret tunnel underneath her hospital.After her death, Edith became a popular figure in British propaganda, encouraging people to join the military.In , Ediths legacy was celebrated on a commemorative pound coin. The inscription reads, She faced them gentle and bold.  Edith Cavell quotes Patriotism is not enough, I must have no hatred or bitterness to anyone. I have no fear nor shrinking I have seen death so often that it is not strange or fearful to me. Someday, somehow, I am going to do something useful, something for people. They are, most of them, so helpless, so hurt and so unhappy.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that. We have Kenny Miller’s nous as well because he makes clever runs up front.”Looking towards Wednesday’s vital home clash with Hamilton, Jim will have the same squad as was on duty in the capital to pick from.“There were a few bumps and bruises but nothing serious and they should all be OK.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dee boss macca demands more of men ahead of hectic schedule","story":"As he works to turn Dundee’s season round, boss Jim McIntyre has told his players to speak up – when things go right as well as wrong.Jim himself has never been slow to let players from the technical area knowthey’ve not been pulling their weight.He also believes praise, when praise is due, must be dished out.And he wants that attitude to spill over onto the pitch during games and even in training.“We need to be demanding of each other. It can’t just come from the manager, it’s got to come from the players who are on the park,” he said.“That’s what we’ve been encouraging since we came in the door.“If somebody needs a rocket, then they get it, but encourage after that.“If they need told ‘you need to do better’, then tell them. That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone. It’s just about making sure you are recovering well between games and getting ready to go. There’s not a lot of turn around between games.“It’s an opportunity for us to maximise as many points as we can and get back into the pack.“But we’re going to need every one of the squad.“It’s a tough, tough period and there will be times when we just make changes simply because we need to freshen it, not just based on the performance.”Between now and the winter break, Jim will pay particular attention to his “over s” like Darren O’Dea, Martin Woods, Paul McGowan and Kenny Miller.At , striker Miller is comfortably the old man of the Dens Park squad.Jim, though, knows ultimately their experience will help tell them how their bodies are and whether or not they need a break from games or even training.“As a manager, I’ve always made sure that I look after the older players in the group.“I think when you are that age it’s your mentality, you know what it takes to get yourself through a game.“You know what you need to do to recover, you know how your body is.“Equally, you know

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13664076.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS169410821.jpg","title":"cctv cameras blink another ayrshire","story":"NewsCCTV cameras on blink at ANOTHER Ayrshire hospital following stabbing at Ayrs AilsaThe Ayrshire Post can reveal that the Ailsa is not the only Ayrshire hospital where cameras are not recording.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsDetectives scour the scene at the Ailsa Hospital \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSecurity cameras at MORE than one Ayrshire hospital have gone dark, it can be revealed. It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr.

Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas. Poppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them. The Mauchline Primary pupil created an informative poster to share with others about the commitment involved in keeping the four footed pals as pets. Proud mum Elaine, , posted Poppy’s efforts online and her message has gone viral- reaching Germany, Calornia and Australia. The P youngster advised others that rabbits need a big spaced cage, hay, fresh water and lots of TLC. Poppy shares her creatively named bunnies with sister Holly, , and the pair enjoy feeding them snacks of cabbage. Copper, Iggy, Skyler and Jasper are just a handful of the furry friends who make up the Wyllie’s colony.  Poppy decided to make her educational poster after she heard a horror story about a poor rescue bunny. She said: “It lived in a drawer for four years and that’s not fair.” Mum-of-two Elaine said: “I had read a story about a rescue rabbit and told the girls. “And Poppy saidshe could look after her rabbits then an adult shouldn’t be treating their rabbit that way. “She made a poster to raise awareness coming up to Christmas as she wants people to know how much care they need- so they are sure they are a suitable pet for their family. “She wants people to share so all bunnies have a good le and not just a good Christmas.” MBM Vets Mauchline have now shared Poppy’s poster online, urging others to spread the news of what rabbits “need to be healthy and happy”. The animal-daft family own a small zoo with  guinea pigs, two dogs, three budgies, one gecko and five horses making up their collection.

Thatrsquos unfair to the Borders and unfair to Peebles, because so much would be spent on replacing primaries in other towns, that the high schools in Peebles and quite possible in Selkirk, would be kicked down the road.ldquoThe finance team are holding up a big warning sign, saying that to do even one campus, we would need to be up to our borrowing limit and wersquod need reschedule the current capital plan.ldquoItrsquos unfair to delude councillors and the public into thinking that four campus options, and community facilities are all financially realistic options.In response, council leader Shona Haslam rebuked claims the report unfairly favoured Galashiels: ldquoThis has been a robust process and deliberation, which has been undertaken with an open mind as to which town has the greatest need for a new learning facility, and recommendations have been made on that basis.ldquoItrsquos  to say that the consultation is incomplete, it has been completed, but further consultation is required.ldquoNo-one is pitching anyone against anyone. Only the councillors who have spoken in this debate are saying that.ldquoCouncillor McAteer, the door is not slammed on Hawick, and it is mischievous of you to suggest that.ldquoHawick is getting a new high school as quickly as humanly possible as this council is able to deliver it.ldquoIt seems strange that a councillor from Tweeddale is having to stand up in this chamber and say that Hawick is still a proud seat of learning.ldquoIt has a fantastic staff, and some fantastic people doing some incredible things.

model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are

Council.Instead, he said Article  allows the ldquounilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded.The case to decide whether an EU member state such as the UK can decide on its own to revoke the Article  withdrawal process, or whether the agreement of the  other member states would be required, was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians.A statement from the ECJ said: ldquoIn answer to the question from the Scottish court, the Advocate General proposes that the Court of Justice should, in its future judgment, declare that Article  TEU allows the unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded, provided that the revocation has been decided upon in accordance with the member statersquos constitutional requirements, is formally notied to the European Council and does not involve an abusive practice.The opinion, which is not binding on the court, comes just a week after the case was heard at the ECJ following a referral from Scotlandrsquos highest civil court, the Court of Session.A judgment by the court will take place at a later date.Those who brought the case argue unilateral revocation is possible and believe it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as a Peoplersquos Vote to enable remaining in the EU.Legal representatives for the UK Government believe the case is inadmissible as it deals with a hypothetical situation, since the Governmentrsquos policy is not to revoke Article .Lawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission argue revocation is possible but would

request for the Court of Session to refer the question of whether Article  can be unilaterally revoked to the ECJ was initially refused, before that ruling was overturned on appeal.Two attempts by the UK Government, which is contesting the case, to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected.At the hearing last week, Aidan OrsquoNeill QC, representing the politicians who brought the case, said they need to know all their options on Brexit, including whether the UK can unilaterally halt the process ahead of critical votes on the withdrawal agreement.Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen QC, representing the UK Government, said the case is a ldquohypothetical validity challenge and those behind it seek ldquopolitical ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament.Hubert Legal, representing the Council of the European Union, said allowing unilateral withdrawal could lead to ldquodisaster, of which ldquothe main victim could be the European project

overseas.Most of these volunteers were women and included such notable figures as the author Agatha Christie, campaigner Vera Brittain, Wimbledon champion Lottie Dod and suffragist Sophia Duleep Singh.However, the vast majority of First World War volunteers were ordinary women, and men, who cared for the wounded and sick, drove ambulances and acted as clerks, cooks and storekeepers.They gave dedicated, compassionate and skilled humanitarian service at a time of national crisis.The role of women during the war, in particular, led to signicant social change with women, driven by their war experiences, seeking greater opportunities in the workplace and securing the same voting rights as men in .Given the sheer number of people who volunteered as VADs during the First World War, it seems likely that many of your readers will have ancestors who gave service during the conflict.And, today, thanks to the popularity of genealogical websites and TV programmes like Who Do You Think You Are  many are keen to trace their family trees and better understand the lives and war-time roles of their ancestors.Traditionally, much of that focus has been on the men who served, and in hundreds of thousands of cases, lost their lives on the front line.Courier readers can use The British Red Cross# new online VAD database to find outtheir ancestors, especially women relatives, performed a civilian role during the war.Searchable by name, location and occupation, the database includes service records and, in some cases, photographs.Anyone can access the website at https:vad.redcross.org.uk and potentially discover new and illuminating facets to their family history.Dr Alasdair Brooks,British Red Cross Heritage,London."},{"url":null,"title":"letter bingo boost

Campos Sanchez-Bordona rejected the contention that Article  only allows the possibility of revocation following a unanimous decision of the European Council.Instead, he said Article  allows the ldquounilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded.The case to decide whether an EU member state such as the UK can decide on its own to revoke the Article  withdrawal process, or whether the agreement of the  other member states would be required, was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians.A statement from the ECJ said: ldquoIn answer to the question from the Scottish court, the Advocate General proposes that the Court of Justice should, in its future judgment, declare that Article  TEU allows the unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded, provided that the revocation has been decided upon in accordance with the member statersquos constitutional requirements, is formally notied to the European Council and does not involve an abusive practice.The opinion, which is not binding on the court, comes just a week after the case was heard at the ECJ following a referral from Scotlandrsquos highest civil court, the Court of Session.A judgment by the court will take place at a later date.Those who brought the case argue unilateral revocation is possible and believe it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as a Peoplersquos Vote to enable remaining in the EU.Legal representatives for the UK Government believe the case is inadmissible as it deals with a hypothetical situation, since the Governmentrsquos policy is not to revoke

Alyn Smith MEP of the SNP, and Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.Their request for the Court of Session to refer the question of whether Article  can be unilaterally revoked to the ECJ was initially refused, before that ruling was overturned on appeal.Two attempts by the UK Government, which is contesting the case, to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected.At the hearing last week, Aidan OrsquoNeill QC, representing the politicians who brought the case, said they need to know all their options on Brexit, including whether the UK can unilaterally halt the process ahead of critical votes on the withdrawal agreement.Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen QC, representing the UK Government, said the case is a ldquohypothetical validity challenge and those behind it seek ldquopolitical ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament.Hubert Legal, representing the Council of the European Union, said allowing unilateral withdrawal could lead to ldquodisaster, of which ldquothe main victim could be the European project altogether.He said Article  is ldquonot ambiguous, adding: ldquoThe prerogative of acting alone will have been exhausted by putting the notication letter on the councilrsquos table.Tory former attorney general and second referendum campaigner Dominic Grieve welcomed the ruling, telling BBC Radio rsquos Today: ldquoItrsquos clearly signicant.ldquoOf course it doesnrsquot necessarily have to be translated into a judgment, but the

Apart from the obvious fact that the mention of the word Brexit sends most of us into a state of comatose anger delirium , this would be event TV at its most pointless.Unlike in the sort of debates wersquove become used to over the last few years, held before referendums and general elections - and indeed most of the shows it would replace in the schedules - no one other than the MPs watching would have a vote.Adding to the futility surrounding this set-up are the Brexit stances of the only two politicians invited to take part: barring a major change of heart, the positions being argued by Mrs May and Mr Corbyn would not only be similar, but similarly bad.The irony of all this is staggering. Here you have Mrs May, who voted Remain, trying to ram a terrible Brexit deal through Parliament that will, by her Governmentrsquos own admission, make the country poorer. This bleak halfway house leaves the UK worse off in every way, with no control or say over EU policy, having to align itself regardless, while losing all the benefits of the Single Market.Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, a lelong Eurosceptic who claims he voted Remain, has taken his party to a bizarre, opaque and convoluted position that also has us leaving the EU, despite knowing full well this will cause genuine and serious harm to the very people and public services he has spent his political le trying to protect from Tory policy. He agrees with Mrs May on ending free movement and leaving the Single Market, his only real ergence from her being the continual peddling of the fantasy that the EU would give him a far better deal than it gave her. Just because hersquos Jezza, you understand.In some ways, you can see why Mrs May, never a natural performer on this type of , would nevertheless want to take part in a debate. Donrsquot think for a minute itrsquos about persuading the public to support her deal ndash we have no say. No, as is usually the case with the Tories, this is all about selling it to a faction, in this case the grassroots party membership, who she wants to pressure their MPs to vote with, rather than against, her.As for Mr Corbyn, who in another striking similarity with the PM is also a poor public communicator, Irsquom still trying to work out what he thinks he can get out of this exposure.And thatrsquos whyI was Nicola Sturgeon, Irsquod stay well out of it and let these two lame ducks go it alone. For now, at least.The First Minister, who is not only an excellent debater but has a clear and cogent position on Brexit, says she wants in on the action, to put the case for staying in the Single Market and or having a so-called Peoplersquos Vote.Like many, I share her concerns around Scotland being deliberately left out of the process, as her lack of an invite to the debate only highlights. But I honestly donrsquot think she should waste her time with this one.If and when the Peoplersquos Vote, or even another general election is called, both of which are possible scenarios, her voice will be needed to persuade not only Scots, but arguably more importantly voters around the UK, that Brexit can and must be stopped or at least signicantly watered down. In that scenario she should not only debate Mrs May and Mr Corbyn but be ready to make her case against hard Brexiteers like Boris Johnson.Until a meaningful opportunity arises, however, Ms Sturgeon should keep her powder clean and let Mrs May and Mr Corbyn keep fighting the phony war."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9105685.jpg?type=article-full","title":"david-mundell-to-tell-banks-that-brexit-deal-offers-clarity","story":"The Scottish Secretary will try to sell Theresa Mayrsquos deal at a briefing for Scotlandrsquos poundbn financial services sector in Edinburgh.:David Mundell faces cross-party calls to resignAmong the employers taking part will be RBS, Tesco Bank, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, KPMG, Pheonix Group, and CYBG, which owns Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Virgin Money UK.Also attending is Scottish Financial Enterprise, the body representing Scotlandrsquos financial services industry, whose members employ more than , people.The SNP said Mr Mundell must be ldquocompletely deludedhe believed his own spin, and said Mrs Mayrsquos deal and political agreement offered only uncertainty on trade relations.SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said: ldquoIf David Mundell is so confident in the Tory governmentrsquos dodgy deal, hersquoll put his neck on the line and resignit fails to pass through the Commons.

The project was deemed too disrespectful of royalty in the s, and the director later worked on the script with writers Gore Vidal and Anthony Burgess. The film was eventually scheduled to go into production in .But after Mackendrick, who was born in Boston to Glaswegian parents and moved to Glasgow aged seven, accepted a teaching post in the US, it was never made.Ms Dickson Leach describes the script as ldquosimply fantastic and believes Mackendrick aficionados will find much to enjoy in this -minute BBC radio drama.ldquoThe wit is there, the dialogue is very funny in parts and the characters are really well drawn, says the -year-old. ldquoTheyrsquore bright, sparky characters who constantly drive the plot.ldquoMackendrick was all about characters who want something badly and push on through, eventhey are not particularly likeable.

We know No Deal is an option. But as the Prime Minister said herself, No Brexit is also an option, and MPs deserve legal clarity on that.ldquoThey deserve to knowArticle  can be revoked by the unanimous agreement of all  other European states. They deserve to knowit can be unilaterally revoked by the UK parliament instructing the government to do so. We believe they should have that option.Mr Smith said he hoped ldquoa bright new Exit sign would appear next to Mrs May deal and No Deal when the opinion comes this morning."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-to-allow-rally-cars-to-race-through-scotlands-roads","story":"Ministers want to introduce a new permit system and hand councils extra powers to close off public roads ndash potentially kick-starting a new generation of adrenaline-fuelled events across the country.It comes more than four years after a car lost control and ploughed into spectators at the Jim Clark Rally in the Scottish Borders in , killing two men and a woman.Motoring figures and politicians welcomed the latest move, but insisted lessons must be learned.Scottish Tory MP John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoClearly there are huge sensitivities around the tragedy, and that will continue to be the case.ldquoBut itrsquos right that we look at getting this popular event back, which is vital for the local economy.ldquoOf course lessons have to be learned, and any new event needs to have participant and spectator safety right at its heart.ldquoBut this is a step in the right direction, and local people and rally fans alike will be glad to see it.The new plans, which are being consulted on by the Scottish Government, would see a two-stage application process introduced to allow motorsports to take place on closed public roads across Scotland.This would give governing body Motorsport UK the power to issue permits, before the relevant local authority is approached for permission to go ahead.Councils would then be able to decide whether to close public roads and suspend speed limits after weighing up the impact on communities and any potential economic boost.The Jim Clark Rally was held annually from  until , when it entered into dficulties following the deaths of Iain Provan, , Elizabeth Allan, , and Len Stern, .Similarly the Isle of Mull Rally ndash a feature of the sporting calendar since  ndash has not been held in recent years.Both races took place under private legislation, but organisers have since been unable to arrange suitable insurance policies to cover the events.Ministers hope the new proposals ndash which follow in the footsteps of England and Wales ndash will open up a way a forward.Research previously found the Jim Clark Rally was worth pound. million to the Scottish Borders.David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, hailed the consultation as ldquofantastic news.He said: ldquoMotorsport UK is committed to promoting the sport in all its forms and new closed-road regulations would create a wealth of opportunities to do just that.ldquoWe urge the motorsport community to respond positively to the consultation and help us realise the possibility of a new generation of closed-road events in Scotland.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said ministers recognised the need to ldquobalance economic benefits with safety considerations ndash both for spectators and participants.He said: ldquoFollowing the tragic rallying accidents of recent years, Scotland has lost two major events from its sporting calendar and has been unable to host any motorsports on closed public roads.ldquoThis is detrimental to local economies and something which we are seeking to address.

Within the next two years that will rise to  for everybody, with both the Labour and Coalition governments agreeing down the years that such changes are necessary to help deal with the burden of an ageing population.The arguments in favour of the move are sound. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, the cost of providing it was relatively small, with just one in four people living long enough to receive it and those that did generally only surviving a further nine years once theyrsquod started to draw it. Fast forward to  and le expectancy is so high that women in particular can easily expect to live at least  years in retirement, with the cost of providing the state pension expected to balloon from pound billion a year at the moment to poundbn in the s. As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense. Anything that can reduce that burden while also removing a rare historical inequality that favoured women over men is to be welcomed.Yet while the change will affect all working women in the long run, it is only those born in the s that are really feeling its impact. Indeed, while phasing was deemed the fairest way to effect the increase to , it has meant that while a woman born in April  could retire at ,she had been born three years later she would have had to wait until she was . Not only that, but with legislation passed in  speeding up the rate at which equalisation was achieved while also raising the overall state pension age to , a woman born in December  has seen her own retirement date sht first from December  to September  and then on to December .No wonder the affected women are irate, with campaign groups such as Women Against State Pension Inequalityand Backto accusing the Government of robbing them of their retirement dues. Yet while Backto last week won the right to challenge how the Government handled the increases in the courts, it seems unlikely that they will achieve their ultimate goal of having the pension-age increases reversed.Nor should they, particularly when the arguments being put forward by the women are taken into account. While at first the s women claimed their pension age should not be raised because they had not been given adequate time to prepare for the change, more recently they have argued that everything from career breaks to pay inequality make them entitled to earlier and longer payments than men.Their points about historical inequalities are are certainly valid. Thanks to huge societal shts in the past few decades we are getting to a position where women - and men - can just about have it all. Indeed, with men taking on an ever-greater share of household responsibilities, women have been freed up to pursue their career ambitions and that in turn has enabled men to enjoy a better work-le balance. That is to everyonersquos benefit.Yet, as gender pay gap statistics show, the near-equality that so many of us enjoy in the home is not being reflected in the workplace, with men continuing to dominate the most lucrative senior positions while women in general continue to fill lower-paid ones. Not only does that put women at a financial disadvantage when it comes to saving for their own retirements, it also means their careers suffer when there is a child or elderly relative to be cared for: regardless of how committed we are to achieving gender equality, household economics will almost always dictate that the lower salary is the one worth being partly sacriced. That in turn reduces the amount that women can channel into a private or workplace pension, exacerbating the long-term gender pay gap and reinforcing gender stereotypes in the process.But these are problems that affect women entering the workforce just as much as those preparing to leave it and, unless something drastic is done - and fast - they will inevitably go on to impact the working lives of the girls yet to begin their working lives too. Crucially, these are not problems that the state pension - a benefit designed to provide everyone with the same foundation income in retirement, regardless of their other means - can, or should, be used to solve.Yes, the Government has a role to play in helping eradicate inequality, and it must be held to account for that. But reversing for some of us a policy that is supposed to make things fairer for all of us is not the way to do it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9129662.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-urges-theresa-may-to-avoid-utterly-disastrous-deal-in-brexit-talks","story":"Scotlands First Minister called for the UKs departure from the European Union to be delayed in order to find a \"workable alternative\" to Mrs Mays Brexit deal, which faces widespread opposition in the Commons.:Nicola Sturgeon rejects idea of Scottish independence without IndyrefBut in talks at Westminster, Mrs May urged the First Minister to listen to Scottish business chiefs and back the deal or risk going back to \"square one\".Ms Sturgeon said: \"I used todays meeting with the Prime Minister to reiterate that it cannot - and must not - be a  choice between her proposed deal and a no-deal outcome, which threatens to be utterly disastrous for jobs, business and living standards.\"Instead, there must be a recognition that,the PMs deal is defeated in the Commons as is widely expected, then a workable alternative is urgently needed.\"That means there should be an extension to the Article  process, and we will join with those from other parties in trying to secure such an extension.\"Extending the Article  process would keep the UK in the EU beyond the current March   departure date.:Against the odds: Theresa May begins parliamentary fight of her le to win Brexit Plan voteMs Sturgeon added: \"The SNP will lay our amendment to the meaningful vote later this week and we will continue to work with others to build consensus around alternative proposals that would deliver on the vote of the people of Scotland to remain.\"With the UK Governments own published figures now making clear that any kind of Brexit would make us all poorer, the time has come for all those who oppose the extreme Brexit championed by the right-wing of the Tory Party to come together and make a stand.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The Prime Minister spoke about the support she has received from fishermen, farmers and business leaders - like Sir Ian Wood - who back the deal as it gives them the clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards.\"The Prime Minister urged the First Minister to listen to these voices in their support of the deal as opposed to risking a no-deal Brexit or going back to square one of negotiations.\"The First Ministers visit comes after all parties at Holyrood, except the Conservatives, united to back a motion opposing Mrs Mays Brexit deal.MSPs will vote on the motion at the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6920976.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ecj-advocate-general-says-uk-can-revoke-article-50-unilaterally","story":"European Court of Justice advocate general Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona has said the UK can \"unilaterally\" revoke its withdrawal from the EU.:Nicola Sturgeon urges Theresa May to avoid utterly disastrous deal in Brexit talksA statement from the ECJ said: \"In answer to the question from the Scottish court, the Advocate General proposes that the Court of Justice should, in its future judgment, declare that Article  TEU allows the unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded, provided that the revocation has been decided upon in accordance with the member states constitutional requirements, is formally notied to the European Council and does not involve an abusive practice.\"SNP MEP Alyn Smith, one of those who brought the case, said: \"This is a huge win for us, and a huge step forward from the highest court in the business, and confirms what we have been hoping for: that the UK can indeed change its mind on Brexit and revoke Article , unilaterally.This is big news.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however.

We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

It wasn’t. I’ve been involved in sport my whole le and the level of sexism is unreal.”Hegerberg told Skysports: “Hecame to me afterwards and was really sad that it went that way.

I was just happy to do the dance and win the Ballon d’Or to be honest.”: Jamie Murray calls Serena Williams sexism claims ‘far-fetched’Accompanied by a video apologising further to Hegerberg, Solveig wrote on Twitter: “Sincere apologies to the one I may have offended.“My point was: I don’t invite women to twerk but dance on a Sinatra song. Watch the full sequence.“People who have followed me for  years know how respectful I am especially with women.”Three-time Olympic bronze medallist Kelly Sotherton was another who condemned his actions, commenting on a video of the incident, writing “Wtf ”Solveig posted a picture of the pair embracing and wrote: “I explained to @AdaStolsmo the buzz and she told me she understood it was a joke.“Nevertheless my apologies to anyone who may have been offended.

A further suspension for  days could follow, and Theresa May’s deputy David Lidington could also be in line for a sanction.Suspension would rob the government of precious votes ahead of MPs’ decision on the Brexit deal in a week’s time, with the survival of Theresa May’s deal already looking unlikely.Mr Cox was repeatedly challenged about the issue in the Commons on Monday but insisted it was in the public interest for the legal advice he gave to ministers to remain confidential.“The House has at its disposal the means by which to enforce its will,” he acknowledged.“It can bring a motion of contempt and seek to have that motion passed and seek to impose through the committee, or whichever way it is appropriately done, to impose a sanction. I fully accept that.“I don’t set myself up contrary to the House, I simply say that I cannot compromise the public interest.”Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “The contempt the Tories have shown Parliament and the people of this country demonstrates that they are not fit for the office they hold.”: Opinion: Only clean Brexit break can help us nowShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “We have given ministers numerous opportunities to comply with the order of Parliament and to release the Attorney General’s full and final legal advice on the Government’s Brexit deal. However, they have refused to do so.“We have therefore been left with no option but to press ahead with contempt proceedings.”He added:“Even at this eleventh hour, I would urge ministers to step back from the brink and to not go down in history as the first Government to be found in contempt.”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: “MPs expect the publication of the full legal Brexit advice before the debates on the withdrawal deal begin.“The Government must not be allowed to use this chaotic situation to take focus away from the mess they are making of Brexit.”The cross-party motion tabled by Labour, the SNP, Lib Dems, DUP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party states that the House of Commons finds ministers in contempt for failing to comply with the resolution passed by MPs in November demanding the legal advice and “orders its immediate publication”.Solicitor General Robert Buckland told BBC’s Newsnight it was a “complete ersion” and a “concocted parliamentary parlour game that should be stopped”.But Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg told the programme: “I would say publish and avoid being in contempt of the House of Commons, which is a very serious matter.”The issue risks overshadowing Mrs May’s effort to win over MPs ahead of the showdown in a week’s time.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4837244.1543579387!/image/image.jpg","title":"first gets motoring with 75 more eco buses","story":"Transport giant FirstGroup will take delivery of dozens of new ultra-low emission buses next year after a further investment in its Glasgow operations.The firm plans to invest in  new vehicles, which includes £, of investment from the Green Bus Fund and an additional £. million from First Bus.

In December , the ground shted for Scotland’s private renters with the introduction of the Private Residential Tenancy for all new tenancies alongside a new free-to-access tribunal, set up to resolve disputes between landlords and renters.   The new system was introduced to rebalance the relationship between private renters and their landlords. Shelter Scotland was one of the leading voices in the decade-long campaign for this new type of tenancy. Last year,  per cent of calls to our free housing advice helpline came from private renters – a disproportionate number as privately rented homes represent only  per cent of households in Scotland – many of whom complained of repairs issues and who often felt the balance of power lay squarely with their landlords, given the limited security that the old Short-Assured Tenancy offered.The statistics on private renting show high growth in the sector, which has tripled in size since . Many more people are wanting to rent from private landlords for longer and looking for the additional security that a long-term home provides.This is why Shelter Scotland campaigned for the new tenancy which, we hope, will eventually provide private renters with the stability they want while retaining the flexibility they need. A key change introduced by the new system is the removal of the “no fault” grounds for eviction. Landlords must now provide a tenant with a valid reason should they want the property back – and tenants can now challenge this at the new tribunal,required. : David Alexander: Rental costs pale compared with other essentialsSo far, there is evidence that shows the new tenancy is having a positive impact. Over the past year, we have been running workshops and talking to tenants and landlords and letting agents.One tenant told me that the new rules were giving people back a sense of security. The tenant, who said she is soon to become a landlord herself, said that “at one point it was accepted that you could be born and die in the same home. But for years the lack of secure housing has meant people have been constantly on the move, uprooted from schools, family, support networks”. The removal of fixed-term tenancies for new renters means that people should feel more stable and be able to plan ahead. One tenant who had been renting in central Edinburgh for the last three years talked about her experience of being forced to commit to a rent increase every six months or face looking for a new place to stay, which was stressful. She now has one of the new tenancies which means that rent increases are limited to one every  months – and with three months’ notice. Although she does feel more secure as a result, she still has concerns over how landlords may “try to get around the rules” – such as trying to evict so they can make seasonal ‘killings’ during the Festival season. This is the sort of bad practice the new tenancy hopes to eradicate.: Scottish Labour calls for ‘state intervention’ in private rented sectorAnother tenant had put up with a bad neighbour rather than move, as she knew her existing landlord wouldn’t end her tenancy unexpectedly, but had heard of many other renters being told to move out after their initial six months’ contract ended and so chose to accept the unwanted noise rather than encounter the unknown. The same renter also highlighted, even with the removal of “no fault” evictions, there are still  grounds for eviction that a landlord may use to end a tenancy so there is still an element of uncertainty in private renting.At Shelter Scotland, we believe that over the long-term, the security and stability afforded by the new tenancy will drive up standards in the private rented sector. Some renters talked about their disrepair over experiences before the new rules came in. One renter went without heating or hot water for several weeks because the letting agency didn’t treat a broken boiler as an urgent repair. Under the new tenancy agreement, this tenant could demand the letting agent or landlord act without fear that they might be evicted should they complain.A year on and there is no doubt the legislation has begun to sht the power balance between tenant and landlords towards a more equal footing. There is still a long way to go, not least because far too many private tenants aren’t aware of their new rights and how to enforce them.In my experience of the last year, private tenants are more likely to take issues to the tribunal or contact their landlord or letting agent directly with issues because they feel empowered and more secure under the new system.The tenant who had the faulty boiler  She said it wasn’t just the fear of eviction that stopped her demanding an urgent repair, it was that the agent didn’t respond to her calls. As another client, whose washing machine flooded the kitchen the day after she moved in, put it: “It feels too challenging asking the agency to do things. It took several phone calls to them and then Shelter Scotland to seek advice. It proved incredibly stressful and affected my mental health.” We need more people to tackle bad landlords and letting agents to ensure that private renting genuinely is fit for the st century. The legislation is in place and private residential tenants have greater rights. It is now vital that they are empowered to use them when necessary – the real transformation in private renting will be when they don’t have to.James Mullaney is project officer on Shelter Scotland’s Private Renters’ Voice Project©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4837290.1543669277!/image/image.jpg","title":"outlander s craig mcginlay on rugby acting and teamwork","story":"From blending with Beckham to hanging with Sam Heughan, the Scottish actor is on the moveCraig McGinlay is going places. He’s already made the move from playing rugby to acting with a role in the latest season of Outlander, and now he’s moving ahead of the pack with a new Bollywood film, Shamshera. Right now he’s on the phone minutes after his flight from Mumbai lands, catching a connection to Scotland where he is due for a bout of fight training for his latest role.“SorryI sound a bit tired and jetlagged.” He doesn’t, in fact. He sounds on a high after a week of meetings and rehearsals for the action adventure film, walking and talking  to the dozen in his warm Paisley tones as he cuts a swathe through the airport, all sculpted beard, Matchless leather jacket and jeans. In four short years, he’s made the move from working as a sports consultant to acting in films, this latest being made by Bollywood giants Yash Raj Films. Directed by Karan Malhotra, Shamshera stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor as well as McGinlay playing the lead villain.“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind in Mumbai,” he says. “I’ve never been there before and I’m just getting used to it. I’m back for a week here, then back to India and we’re filming until July.”We’ll catch him while we can, when he’s back for a bit of dreich weather to cool him down after the heat of India.“I like dreich-ness,” he says, “the fresh air.” He’s upbeat and positive and why wouldn’t he be  He’s running with the ball, taking his chances without getting ahead of himself. With his muscular physique he’s action hero villain material and has played both so far, honing his sword skills and horsemanship as well as his acting. Guy Ritchie cast him as good guy Sir Percival in last year’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which starred Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. Then he nailed lead villain Aldred in Knightfall, a historical drama about the Knights Templar on the History Channel alongside Tom Cullen. He packs a punch too in the season two opener of the Edinburgh-filmed BBC  student thriller Clique, before playing a baddie again in Outlander. “I play a horrible guy called MacNeil and the army of Outlander fans on Twitter have been at me over it,” he laughs. “No, there’s been a lot of positive feedback. I never really thought I was gonna play villains because I always loved watching Superman and James Bond and I thought action hero roles were for me. And I do still want to do those, but the latest three have been villains, so it’s nice to do that too.“This is my first Bollywood film and I didn’t know much about it,” he says. “But I do now. Bollywood just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It was daunting, but it’s been amazing. I’ve worked on big sets – King Arthur and Outlander were massive – but I’ve been blown away by this. There are  people on the sets in India just now, building forts, castles, docks, caves, it’s incredible.” McGinlay didn’t expect to break into the Bollywood market, but after Guy Ritchie finished King Arthur, he moved on to making Aladdin, using a lot of Bollywood actors and the same casting director who was working on Shamshera.“There was that initial connection: it’s a small world,” says McGinlay, who knows to take his chances when he can, and put in the hard work when he is given an opportunity. “I’m playing a British soldier and I’ve been doing screen tests, rehearsals, stunt work with horses and fitness and soldier training. “And I’m doing some fight training now with Seoras Wallace who did the fight choreography on Braveheart, Gladiator and Highlander. I’m also working with my friend Roger Gracie Gomes, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter. So it’s a real adrenalin rush movie, it’s going to be fun.”But McGinlay is not all action and no words – in fact he’s learning Hindi for the part, something a bit dferent to go alongside his swashbuckling skill set.“I speak a little bit of Hindi in this so I’ve been doing intensive language training. I would never have thought I would be learning another language for a movie any time soon, but I’m really excited about the challenge and enjoying it so far.” Not that he’s been out and about in the sprawl of Mumbai to practise his vocabulary. With a schedule that consists of am pick-ups and full studio days of rehearsals, Hindi training, screen tests, costume fittings and horse riding, he’s hardly been out of the studio.“I’ve only been out to go to meetings and do muay thai training at Soho House, although that has phenomenal views of the beach! Once we start shooting I’ll be there for a long time, so maybe I’ll get to walk along it.” Among the on-set discussions has been the question of McGinlay’s appearance, from hair colour to moustache, beard or no beard. “They’re trying dferent looks, dferent hair colouring, moustache, no moustache. We’ll see. If a director wants something, I give it a go, whether it’s having a moustache or dferent hair colour or having to go skinny or bulk up, learn a language… The exciting thing for me is the challenge of trying to become the character.”The grooming issue is something McGinlay has been brushing up on since he started acting and did a bit of modelling too. He picked up Breakthrough Star of the Year at the  Scottish Style Awards and was named as British GQ Rising Star last year, requiring him to get red carpet ready.“It’s all a bit of a change for me from shorts, T-shirts and trainers, which is what I wore before. It’s a bit of a learning curve,” he laughs.Shamshera won’t be released until , but McGinlay is on our screens at the moment in Outlander, season four of the Starz and Amazon Prime International hit which features Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe. Based on Diana Gabaldon’s historical time travel novels following the adventures of Jacobite Highlander Jamie Fraser and Second World War nurse Claire Randall, the new series sees them building a le in th century America. It’s a time of slavery and colonisers encountering Native Americans, with Scotland doubling as North Carolina. McGinlay plays Andrew MacNeil, a Scot who leads a racist mob. “He’s not a nice guy – a horrible character and a horrible situation. I thought Outlander dealt with the slavery issue very well, and these issues should be raised. It was a tough episode to film and it hit home how bad that situation was. There were a couple of people crying on set, and you do feel emotion. The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.“Because there’s a massive Outlander fan base you want to do these characters justice, but I was such a small part of this beast of a machine that is Outlander. It was amazing to be part of it.”McGinlay was pleased to be involved not least because he sees the “Outlander effect” as building momentum for the establishment of a Scottish film studio. “Outlander is sparking ripples throughout Scotland. You see it at the Baftas, in the press, all the talk of building a film studio. It would be a massive positive because there are so many talented, passionate people in the industry here who are just dying to get in there – we could do some good stuff.”Now  and based in London, McGinlay is modest about his success so far, although ambitious to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.“I’m still new to acting and I’m learning all the time,” he says. “I wasn’t sure how some actors might take it, because I’m not trained in acting and I’ve obviously moved quite quickly within the last two and a half years. It’s early stages…” One of the actors whose path he has crossed is fellow Paisley Buddy Gerry Butler, who he first met at a film festival last year in Ischia, Italy. “I’ve only met him two or three times, so don’t know him well, but he’s been really kind, given me some good advice and introduced me to a couple of people. And obviously the guy’s from Paisley, and doing really, really well, has an amazing career.”At one time McGinlay was destined for a rugby career, playing for the national under-s team in the World Cup, but was forced out by injury in . “I dislocated my shoulder playing in a World Cup in Italy and had two operations. I could probably have come back and played as it doesn’t cause me any hassle now. I liked the game, but I probably didn’t love it enough.” Determined to stay in sport, McGinlay did a sports science and physiology degree at the University of Stirling and after graduating started working with professional athletes. Setting up his own consultancy, he worked with professional footballers and rugby players, focusing on general fitness and doing sports massage. He trained athletes for the  Delhi,  London and  Commonwealth Games, working with the hockey, badminton, swimming, cycling, weightlting teams. “Then they took the ones I was working with to make an advert for the Games and said the weightlter was a little bit too short, would I step in  Why not  I had to pull on this tiny one-piece weightlting outfit and was out in the cold by the Squinty Bridge [in Glasgow] with everyone looking, thinking, ‘What is this idiot doing, lting a bar above his head’, doing a clean jerk.” He laughs. “Anyway, the ad came out and randomly a director saw it and I got a lead role in a short film that randomly won best thriller in LA and Calgary so I went out for the premiere. It wasn’t Hollywood or anything, but it was a great experience and I hadn’t done anything like that before. I loved it.” Back home in Glasgow, McGinlay signed up with an extras agency and did a couple of adverts, one being for the Haig Club whisky, starring the brand collaborator David Beckham and the stunning Scottish landscape, directed by Guy Ritchie. “It was just five days’ shooting, but I got to know Guy quite well and that was a turning point for me. I was standing in Glencoe looking down at Guy behind the monitor and [cinematographer] John Mathieson behind the camera and [film pilot] Marc Wolff taking shots of Beckham riding his motorbike up Glencoe, and that was it for me. So many great movies were made there, like Skyfall, and it felt so cinematic, although it was an advert. I decided: when I come off this I’m gonna go back, quit my job, move to London at least give it a go. If it doesn’t work out, then, you know, it’s not worked out…”But it did work out: within four months McGinlay had an agent, auditioned for Ritchie’s King Arthur and landed the part of Sir Percival. “It was very hard to give up my job because it was going well and I did love it, but I can always go back. I wanted to keep going with the wave, having done the advert, met Guy, wanted to keep the pace going and move to London. So that was another turning point: I moved down and did King Arthur, then got Knightfall.” With Chris Pine famously watching Scottish rugby captains on YouTube to prepare for his role of Robert the Bruce in Outlaw King, McGinlay has the advantage, being the real McGinlay and able to jink the middle man. For him, the worlds of rugby and acting are not so far apart. “There are similarities, things like bulking up and getting fit and ‘in the zone’. How I prepared in the dressing room as a rugby player is still how I build up for a fight scene or any kind of fight choreography. You pump yourself up for it. Outlander was the same, marching at the head of a mob, you’ve got to get yourself into a zone and turn yourself into a dferent character. “Running out onto a sports field you have to play a character a bit as well. You’ve got to make that last tackle, be aggressive, stand up for yourself. Rugby’s about teamwork and it’s the same in acting – costume, hair, make-up, director, producer, writer, everyone’s trying to do their best.”As someone who never seems to stand stillit’s time for McGinlay to catch his next flight. “I’m not in any way there or where I want to be yet. It’s very early stages. I’m still massively learning. I’ve had a few good short film roles, three good roles in three big productions so far and this is the fourth one now, so it’s going well, but I’m still way, way short of where I want to be. “I’ve not made it or anything.

Mrs May will today tell MPs that the public withdrew their consent for pooling sovereignty with the EU, and must have their wishes delivered through a Brexit deal.“Ultimately, membership of any union can only be sustained with the consent of the people,” the Prime Minister will say.“In the referendum of , the biggest democratic exercise in our history, the British public withdrew that consent. They confirmed that choice a year later by voting overwhelmingly for parties that committed to delivering Brexit.“The referendum was a vote to bring our EU membership to an end and to create a new role for our country in the world.”Mrs May will claim that only her deal can deliver an end to free movement of people while delivering “an unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has”.“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum,” the Prime Minister will say. “This is the deal that delivers for the British people.”With around  Conservative MPs saying they could vote against the deal, the odds are stacked against the government. Labour has said it will bring a motion of no confidence in the governmentit is defeated, which could bring about a general election. Mrs May’s DUP allies have hinted they could abandon her in the event of a confidence vote.Opposition MPs are also set to push for a second EU referendumthe Brexit deal collapses.Meeting Mrs May last night for the second time in two weeks, Ms Sturgeon appealed for a plan B and pledged to work with other parties to delay Brexit by extending Article  – something Downing Street ruled out yesterday.Following the meeting in Mrs May’s Commons office, the First Minister insisted that next week’s vote “cannot – and must not – be a  choice between [the Prime Minister’s] proposed deal and a no-deal outcome, which threatens to be utterly disastrous.”Ms Sturgeon added: “The SNP will lay our amendment to the meaningful vote later this week and we will continue to work with others to build consensus around alternative proposals that would deliver on the vote of the people of Scotland to remain.“With the UK government’s own published figures now making clear that any kind of Brexit would make us all poorer, the time has come for all those who oppose the extreme Brexit championed by the right-wing of the Tory party to come together and make a stand.”A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister spoke about the support she has received from fishermen, farmers and business leaders – like Sir Ian Wood – who back the deal as it gives them the clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards.”Over the coming days in the Commons, Mrs May will deploy senior Cabinet ministers to make the case, with Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid expected to appear at the despatch box.The first day of debate will be closed by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, who faced embarrassment yesterday after appearing not to know when the UK is leaving the EU.Giving evidence to MPs on the Brexit committee, Mr Barclay, who took over the role last month after the resignation of Dominic Raab, said Britain was quitting the bloc on  March, rather than the actual date of  March.Tomorrow’s debate will focus on security, while Thursday’s debate will be on the economy.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4838745.1543916114!/image/image.jpg","title":"uk can cancel brexit according to top law officer","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The UK can unilaterally revoke its withdrawal from the EU, according to a European Court of Justice advocate general#s legal opinion.Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona rejected the contention that Article  only allows the possibility of revocation following a unanimous decision of the European Council.Instead, he said Article  allows the “unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded”.The case to decide whether an EU member state such as the UK can decide on its own to revoke the Article  withdrawal process, or whether the agreement of the  other member states would be required, was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians.A statement from the ECJ said: “In answer to the question from the Scottish court, the Advocate General proposes that the Court of Justice should, in its future judgment, declare that Article  TEU allows the unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded, provided that the revocation has been decided upon in accordance with the member state’s constitutional requirements, is formally notied to the European Council and does not involve an abusive practice.” - Andy Murray leads criticism of Ballon d’Or host for ‘twerk’ commentsThe opinion, which is not binding on the court, comes just a week after the case was heard at the ECJ following a referral from Scotland’s highest civil court, the Court of Session.A judgment by the court will take place at a later date.Those who brought the case argue unilateral revocation is possible and believe it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as a People’s Vote to enable remaining in the EU.Legal representatives for the UK Government believe the case is inadmissible as it deals with a hypothetical situation, since the Government’s policy is not to revoke Article .Lawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission argue revocation is possible but would require unanimous agreement from all member states.The case was brought forward in February by a group of Scottish politicians - Labour MEPs Catherine Stihler and David Martin, Joanna Cherry MP and Alyn Smith MEP of the SNP, and Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.Their request for the Court of Session to refer the question of whether Article  can be unilaterally revoked to the ECJ was initially refused, before that ruling was overturned on appeal. - Brexit: Government faces contempt of parliament vote over legal adviceTwo attempts by the UK Government, which is contesting the case, to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected.At the hearing last week, Aidan O’Neill QC, representing the politicians who brought the case, said they need to know all their options on Brexit, including whether the UK can unilaterally halt the process ahead of critical votes on the withdrawal agreement.Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen QC, representing the UK Government, said the case is a “hypothetical validity challenge” and those behind it seek “political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament”.Hubert Legal, representing the Council of the European Union, said allowing unilateral withdrawal could lead to “disaster”, of which “the main victim could be the European project altogether”.He said Article  is “not ambiguous”, adding: “The prerogative of acting alone will have been exhausted by putting the notication letter on the council’s table.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4838697.1543870945!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots children drinking more than 600k sugary drinks a day","story":"Children across Scotland consume almost . million soft drinks a week # or more than , a day # new research has estimated.The figures, produced by Cancer Research UK, prompted demands for Scottish ministers to change the law to crack down on supermarket multi-buy offers on sugary drinks, many of which are sold as part of bulk-buy deals.Professor Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK’s prevent expert, said this would help by “deterring families from stocking up on drinks that are doing so much damage to our diets”.Health campaigners there had used data from the - Scottish Health Survey to calculate the number of soft drinks – including fizzy drinks, energy drinks and diluting juice with added sugar – that youngsters were consuming.By applying the frequency at which these were consumed to the number of children aged between two and , they estimated youngsters across the country drank , of these a day – amounting to ,, a week. The figures did not include diet drinks, low calorie or no added sugar drinks, or fresh fruit juices.Official NHS figures for the school year - found almost a quarterof pupils in P were at at risk of being either overweight or obese.While the UK government has introduced a so-called “sugar tax” on soft drinks, Prof Bauld insisted more could be done.She said: “It’s scandalous that sugary drinks are now a routine part of what our children are consuming daily.“Supermarket multi-buy deals encourage us to bulk buy, so these drinks are always within reach at home.“And with almost a quarter of children as young as four entering primary school overweight or obese, the dreadful consequences of our diets are all too obvious.“While the Sugar Tax was a step in the right direction, there’s much more to be done.“The Scottish Government must take action by introducing laws to restrict the multi-buy offers on junk food and sugary drinks. This measure would go a long way to deterring families from stocking up on drinks that are doing so much damage to our diets.”Her call was backed by grandmother Gail Nesbit, from Easter Drylaw, Edinburgh, whose seven year old granddaughter Maci attends the Fet-Lor Youth Club, in the north of the city.It has recently banned junk food and high sugar drinks from its tuck shop as part of healthy eating initiatives.Ms Nisbet, , said: “The amount of sugary drinks children routinely drink is shocking. So many of the kids go to the supermarket to buy their lunch and of course they’re looking to get the most for their money.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"storm diana set to batter the north","story":"THE tail end of Storm Diana is set to sweep across the north todaywith strong winds of up to mph in some places.A yellow warning has been put in place by the Met Office from am to midnight.The warning adds that some delays to public transport are likely and some journey times could take longer.

Belfast traders voice concerns as they reopen near Primark building But yesterday morning, people were at last able to take the direct route between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place on the specially designed passageway, reinforced with shipping containers.Danny Ross , who is originally from east Belfast, said: \"Itll work for a wee bit, but I cant see it being part of the normal Belfast.\"Theres not much to look at, just a building site or a painted shipping container, either way its not much.\"Retired Marks and Spencer worker Mary Brothersadded: \"It doesnt look pretty, its horrible, but I used to have to walk through Rosemary Street to get to Marks and Spencer - so you had a very long, roundabout journey.\"While its not nice visually, I think its practical, allowing people to come back and I think they will.\"Architect John Anderson viewed the tunnel through a creative lens.The member of Ulster Architectural Heritage said: \"The way this has been done is fine to an extent, but there maybe would have been striking, less bulky ways to do it. But my first impression coming out of the arcade was the street is busy - so thats a positive.\"He added: \"Personally, I might have done it dferently, but a whole lot of people might have done it dferently.\"I would have built a steel structure, so the whole thing would have been strong, but much less bulky and let some light through.\"But Glynis McKew , from Tandragee, Co Armagh, said that she liked the tunnel as it was.The HMRC worker said: \"I think it looks good.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -.

A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme. People in Saintfield are looking for answers to questions they have on the future development of the town.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Can the government get some changes to the agreement and then bring it back to parliament and get it through “The key change they would need would be to take out the bit of the agreement which says we can’t get out of the backstop. They already have a paragraph drafted which never went to the EU, but it basically says the UK can leave the backstopthey find it unsatisfactory.“I suspect that’s what the government will try, but this is going to be very dficult, because particularly Dublin has been saying for two years they won’t accept any backstop which isn’t permanent.“Dublin is just desperate to lock Northern Ireland into this agreement, which I think is something of a slow stairway to a united Ireland and I think they would regard it as one stepping stone in that direction. And having got the deal now they are not going to let it go without one hell of a fight.”Voicing his party’s concerns in the House of Commons, North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds described the withdrawal agreement as “deeply unattractive and unsatisfactory” and said the Attorney General should be recommending that it be rejected.With the government having repeatedly refused to publish the legal advice it received on Brexit in full, Mr Dodds later revealed that the speaker of the House of Commons has been asked to launch proceedings of contempt.“We have now written to the Speaker to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt. Parliament can not be ignored,” he tweeted.Meanwhile, the Secretary of State has claimed the people of Northern Ireland “want the government to get on with it” and deliver the best possible withdrawal deal.People want us to get on with Brexit, says NI Secretary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Karen Bradley has been travelling around the Province over the past couple of weeks campaigning in support of Mrs May’s proposed agreement.try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

legal opinion","story":"Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona rejected the contention that Article  only allows the possibility of revocation following a unanimous decision of the European Council.Instead, he said Article  allows the ldquounilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded.The case to decide whether an EU member state such as the UK can decide on its own to revoke the Article  withdrawal process, or whether the agreement of the  other member states would be required, was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians.A statement from the ECJ said: ldquoIn answer to the question from the Scottish court, the Advocate General proposes that the Court of Justice should, in its future judgment, declare that Article  TEU allows the unilateral revocation of the notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded, provided that the revocation has been decided upon in accordance with the member statersquos constitutional requirements, is formally notied to the European Council and does not involve an abusive practice.The opinion, which is not binding on the court, comes just a week after the case was heard at the ECJ following a referral from Scotlandrsquos highest civil court, the Court of Session.A judgment by the court will take place at a later date.Those who brought the case argue unilateral revocation is possible and believe it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as a Peoplersquos Vote to enable remaining in the EU.Legal representatives for the UK Government believe the case is inadmissible as it deals with a hypothetical situation, since the Governmentrsquos policy is not to revoke Article .Lawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission argue revocation is possible but would require unanimous agreement from all member states.#Brexit ndash Case C-  Wightman ndash AG Campos Saacutenchez-Bordona: Article  TFEU notication of the intention to withdraw from the EU can be revoked unilaterally under certain conditions https:t.co BXuldkaxWxmdash EU Court of JusticeDecember , The case was brought forward in February by a group of Scottish politicians ndash Labour MEPs Catherine Stihler and David Martin, Joanna Cherry MP and Alyn Smith MEP of the SNP, and Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.Their request for the Court of Session to refer the question of whether Article  can be unilaterally revoked to the ECJ was initially refused, before that ruling was overturned on appeal.Two attempts by the UK Government, which is contesting the case, to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected.At the hearing last week, Aidan OrsquoNeill QC, representing the politicians who brought the case, said they need to know all their options on Brexit, including whether the UK can unilaterally halt the process ahead of critical votes on the withdrawal agreement.Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen QC, representing the UK Government, said the case is a ldquohypothetical validity challenge and those behind it seek ldquopolitical ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK Parliament.Hubert Legal, representing the Council of the European Union, said allowing unilateral withdrawal could lead to ldquodisaster, of which ldquothe main victim could be the European project altogether.He said Article  is ldquonot ambiguous, adding: ldquoThe prerogative of acting alone will have been exhausted by putting the notication letter on the councilrsquos table.Tory former attorney general and second referendum campaigner Dominic Grieve welcomed the ruling, telling BBC Radio rsquos Today: ldquoItrsquos clearly signicant.ldquoOf course it doesnrsquot necessarily have to be translated into a judgment, but the opinion of the advocate general is often very influential in forming the opinion of the court and it reinforces something I have to say I personally always thought was probably the case.Askedit made it more likely there would be a new public vote, he said: ldquoIt is certainly helpful because it removes one of the arguments, which is: lsquoOh well, they

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic.

I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.
