It falls asleep inches from my head and wakes up beside me. I breathe its breath. I’ve always been reluctant to call my apartment “home” here in Catania. Over the past 10 years I’ve traversed the Middle East, photographing cities, their inhabitants and the conflicts that have ravaged that area of the world for decades. The streets of Baghdad, Mosul, Kabul, Amman, Khartoum and Tehran have been my home. I’d always considered those 50 sq metres in Catania as a pied-à-terre, a place to keep my clothes and my photo archive. I never could have imagined that after documenting the desperation of refugee camps in Iraq or mass graves in Sinjar, or aboard an ambulance collecting the dead among the Kurdish resistance in northern Syria, that I’d have to confront the world’s biggest story in my own small apartment.I’ve been living with Covid-19 since mid-March. My mother, my partner, the war reporter Marta Bellingreri, and other people close to me have been infected, but somehow I have been spared. I interpreted this peculiar twist as if Covid-19 had chosen me to photograph it from a different perspective. And I met the challenge, also because the reasons that brought the virus into my apartment are also extraordinarily tied to my career as a photographer.Last 25 February I hosted some friends and family members for a celebratory dinner. World Press Photo had just announced the 2020 winners, and, for the second time, I was selected, for my photograph of an Isis bride embracing her child in the prison camp of Al-Hol, north-east Syria. At the same time, cases of Covid-19 throughout Italy had risen from four to 322. No one could have imagined that Sicily’s patient zero was at that dinner table, a friend who had returned from Germany. He had no idea he was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. I left the day after for Khartoum with Marta to photograph a country in the throes of revolution for over a year.The call that changed that trip and the following weeks came six days later, in early March, as Italy and the world were changing for the worse. My friend who had been in Germany had tested positive for Covid-19. The alarm was sounded: phone calls to notify those who may have been infected and tests for the older adults who were at the dinner. Some of my family members tested positive, and my mother was taken immediately to an hospital. She’s 69 and has suffered from respiratory illness in the past. Her life was at risk and my world caved in.Turkey, where we had a connecting flight on the way to Sudan, had already cancelled all flights to Italy. Other countries had restricted entry for anyone who had been to Italy in the previous 14 days. Marta started manifesting symptoms: slight headache, a light fever. We started a self-imposed quarantine in Sudan. But we needed to go back. We returned to Italy with a connecting flight through Asia. Later the ministry of health in Sudan contacted us to track down the people we met: no one had symptoms, tests were negative and all were placed in preventive quarantine. Knowing that Sudan still has only six Covid-19 cases made us breathe a sigh of relief.Upon our arrival, everything seemed surreal. People wearing masks, deserted streets. As soon as possible, we had ourselves tested. Marta received a phone call from the doctor: “Good morning. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that you’ve tested positive. You mustn’t leave the house for any reason. If your fever exceeds 38°C or if you have difficulty breathing, call this number. Do you understand?”I tested negative and was incredulous. I’d been with Marta since that dinner on 25 February. And yet, the virus did not seem to be interested in me. The doctor believed that the test was a false negative, because I began developing symptoms. My temperature ranged between 37.3°C and 37.7°C for days. I decided to grab my camera and do something I had never done before: while I had always photographed others’ suffering, now I had to photograph Marta’s suffering and my own, just as Marta’s condition began to worsen. She had trouble breathing and chest pains, as if a stone were lodged in her ribcage. I put myself in self-isolation, spending the next 14 days with Marta, in my apartment, using protective gear.The doctor suggested that we order an oxygen saturation monitor from the local chemist. It became our best friend. “If the level is 95, everything is fine. If it drops to 92, you need to run to the hospital.” My level was 99 Marta’s 98. But she was not doing well: she told me that it was as if she were wearing a bodice with the laces pulled tight. Friends brought us our groceries, leaving them outside the door. We did our best to plan our days: take our temperature, drink our freshly squeezed orange juice, take our temperature again, call the doctor. We included the oxygen monitor in our daily regime and moved on. I saw my mother on Skype. She was now breathing more easily. We exchanged smiles, but I was out of sorts.The doctors asked me to take a second test, but again I tested negative. Perhaps I’m immune? The days dragged on in my apartment, in black and white, like my photos. Sometimes we tried to smile, imagining that I was asymptomatic, because I was the virus. Our smiles seemed to bring good news. My mother left hospital, but I won’t be able to see her for weeks. Marta started breathing well again, and so did I. I would have liked to photograph my country in the midst of this emergency, the battles that the doctors wage on the frontline, the hospitals pushed to their limits, Italy on its knees fighting an invisible enemy. That enemy, a day in March, knocked on my door instead.Alessio Mamo was talking to Lorenzo Tondo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/996138040c8d37c394b5642a68dc479bf101b8d2/0_129_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eabf75eb61ef56366eaa15c6458b296b","title":"the big picture rene burri shadows of doubt","story":"The chance appearance of a mysterious foursome on a São Paulo rooftop provided the Magnum photographer with a memorable shotThere seem to be two distinct ways of looking at René Burri’s Men on a Rooftop, a defining picture by the renowned Magnum photographer, taken in São Paulo in 1960. One views it as a supreme exercise in composition, like an abstract painting: the photograph is ided into three vertical sections – road, buildings and rooftop – each delineated by contrasts in sunlight and shadow. The image is a photographic equivalent of the modernist architecture it celebrates, dwelling on concrete geometries.In the other way of seeing, the eye fixes on the four figures on the roof. The cityscape below and its teeming traffic becomes a vertiginous backdrop to their curious, elongated silhouettes. The four are cast in an apparently conspiratorial drama that demands to be understood. What is their purpose up there? Why are three of the figures in step behind the man ahead? The shot looks like a still from a film – but the tone is elusive.Speaking about the photograph – a highlight of a forthcoming Magnum print sale – not long before he died in 2014, Burri described how it came about. “Did I know those men were there when I took that photograph? No. Buildings weren’t guarded in those days. It was a question of getting to the top and knocking on the door… ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come in!’ So I walked out on to the terrace and, at that moment, those guys came from nowhere and I shot five images.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049cbbfe9f84db138f67084660900492971532f4/80_13_1716_1030/master/1716..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b94e7a7514800b5b81361402c767c4f","title":"behind the iron curtain the final frontier soviet space art in pictures","story":"With more than 250 artworks sourced from cold war-era Russian magazines, Alexandra Sankova’s book Soviet Space Graphics: Cosmic Visions from the USSR (Phaidon £24.95), produced with the Moscow Design Museum, explores “the dream of conquering space”.One of the most vibrant publications was Tekhnika Molodezhi (Technology for the Youth) its “unearthly palettes of pink-violet and ochre-scarlet colours”, says Sankova, pulling readers into stories of “inventions and innovations, the mysterious and unknown”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1677cd65157509df2b9df479976e4f1adfa3135b/0_105_3200_1921/master/3200..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e217983d1834e86d0b8f68c1d379f58","title":"bondi beach how the australian icon became a coronavirus hotspot","story":"Bondi is one of NSW’s most famous destinations, drawing 2.6 million visitors a year. Has its popularity made it vulnerable to Covid-19?A block from Bondi Beach six female travellers, all aged between 22 and 31, share a two-bedroom flat, each paying $200 a week in rent.They came to Australia, and settled in Bondi, for the work opportunities, the sun and the freedom.Last week, two of the women tested positive for Covid-19.The Sydney beach suburb draws 2.6 million visitors each year, according to Destination New South Wales. It’s a place of contrasts. Sparkling natural bounty and dense urban living. Billionaires and backpackers. Instagrammed bodies and old-timers’ swimming clubs. A place obsessed with health and beauty but now, one of Australia’s Covid-19 hotspots.Bondi, part of Waverley council area, has taken a heavy hit from the coronavirus, the local council’s 159 cases as of Friday (101 of them in Bondi alone) knocking the sunshine out of the surfside playground.This week, in response to Waverley’s newfound status as home to both the highest number of Covid-19 cases and the highest number of locally transmitted cases in the state, the government opened a local pop-up testing clinic. While the advice during the global coronavirus pandemic is to stay home, the reality for some, especially in a place like Bondi, is that crowded living conditions make physical distancing difficult, even for the most prudent.“I couldn’t believe I was negative, I slept in the same room as two positive girls,” says one of the Argentinian housemates who was given the all-clear, who did not want to be named. “I was staying home, worrying about the virus outside, but it was in my own place.”Unsure where to turn, she appealed to the authorities for help and her infected housemates – one of whom is suspected to have caught the virus in the house – were moved into quarantine in hotels, paid for by the government.For the others, a sense of gratitude has settled on the flat: they and their sick housemates are safe and isolated, friends are helping with food deliveries and a neighbour has lent them exercise equipment. She has heard of worse, including newly jobless, homeless travellers who cannot get to their home countries, and infected members of shared houses who have stayed put.They’re like many temporary working visa holders who continue to share cramped homes, some of 12 to 15 people, across the suburb. Since 20 March, hostels, meanwhile, have had to comply with new distancing rules of one person every 4 sq metres. At Noah’s Backpackers, just along from James Packer’s erstwhile beach house, every room, including six-bed dormitories, were made single occupancy.The landmark building has a view down on to the Bondi Beach that is usually alive with crowded surf and its famous lifeguards. On 21 March, the beach was closed, its entrances hastily fenced off. With no surfers and sunbathers, Bondi Beach has never looked so bare. Now in the spotlight as the centre of Australia’s coronavirus outbreak, the suburb has never felt quite so exposed.The scene is a far cry from images just over two weeks ago, when crowds from well beyond Sydney’s east took to the sand on a 36C day, flouting social distancing rules and the new 500-person limit on outdoor gatherings. A hot Friday with family-friendly surf is what Bondi does best – but by the next afternoon and in the glare of global media, police were sweeping the beach of sunbathers, forbidding even surfers to enter the water. For the first time, the beach known around the world as an icon of Australia’s natural beauty and symbol of our love of the sea and sun is now associated with something far less glamorous. When New South Wales chief health Officer Dr Kerry Chant singled out backpackers and their potential to infect the community when outlining the response, she directed public focus towards Bondi’s reputation as a destination for travellers, already in the headlines because of a coronavirus cluster traced to a tropical-themed party at a popular Bondi beachfront bar.From Noah’s Backpackers, the view is bleak. A few weeks ago, the hostel was bustling with 266 guests. Now, it’s desolate, with manager Dylan Tenbrink closing its doors last Wednesday, saying it was “impossible” to stay open under the new regulations around social distancing as well as media scrutiny. Unfounded rumours of a positive case of the virus in the hostel were unfairly targeting backpackers and the result was fear among both visitors and the community, he says.With a young, international demographic and thousands of daily visitors, Bondi’s infection rate comes as little surprise to local photographer and Aquabumps gallery owner, Eugene Tan. He has photographed Bondi Beach at daybreak for the last 21 years, and the daily surf photos are known worldwide.“Bondi’s a brand, everybody knows it. You come to Sydney, you come to Bondi. It’s a welcoming place,” he says. It’s that spirit that might have landed Bondi in the situation it’s in today.“The police cleared the beach on Saturday and then all the bars filled up. It’s a melting pot, which I love, but Bondi gets out of hand easily – we have a lot of travellers and they have a carefree attitude.”But to point to the backpacker community alone as responsible for local infection rates is to miss the reality of Bondi’s broader community.The suburb has long been home to professionals and young families from all over the world and less than half of its population is born in Australia, with many residents from Europe, South Africa, America and Brazil. At a local childcare centre where a parent tested positive for the virus, children speak Italian, French, German, Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Italian. Long-haul travel, responsible for bringing the vast majority of Covid-19 infections into Australia but also for connecting expats with their families, is as much a way of life as the beach.The Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, says it is the kindness of the community and its adaptability that stands it in good stead for the future. “We are all in this together.” Brand Bondi, after all, reaches well beyond its bay and, to Tan, its pull is stronger than ever. He has been receiving messages from people all over the world telling him how images of Bondi are keeping them sane during lockdown.“Without the beach,” he says, “you feel a bit lost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6afe885a6ad54054574106f09f3697b2278153/0_202_5447_3270/master/5447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62de52924678f302a1291d53a6d75107","title":"cath kidston to call in administrators amid coronavirus lockdown","story":"Troubled fashion chain’s decision puts 940 UK jobs at risk Cath Kidston is preparing to call in administrators, putting more than 900 jobs at risk, as the vintage-inspired chain battles for survival during the coronavirus lockdown.The business, which has 60 stores in the UK and a further 180 overseas, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal process which protects the business from creditors for 10 working days, as it considers potential rescue options. The group employs 941 people in the UK, 820 of whom were furloughed on 22 March under the government scheme.Advisory firm Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal (A\u0026ampM) was appointed last month to help Cath Kidston seek a buyer as the British brand, which opened its first store in 1993, struggled to make a profit for its Hong Kong-based owner Baring Private Equity Asia.Coronavirus lockdowns in the UK and elsewhere have only added to the difficulties and it is understood that even if a buyer is found, the rescue is likely to involve a pre-pack administration.A Cath Kidston spokesperson said: “The notice of intention forms part of the process by which Cath Kidston is continuing to work with A\u0026ampM to explore all options for the company in the current climate.”The group is one of many retailers battling for survival in the UK after the Covid-19 pandemic forced the closure of most stores.Debenhams is also preparing to call in administrators after the struggling department store was forced to close all its outlets under the lockdown while Sir Phillip Green’s Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge, is expected to permanently close hundreds of stores as it suffers from competition from the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark.The lockdown has added to existing pressures on retailers from the consumer switch to online shopping and rising costs from business rates coupled with the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 Brexit vote.Fashion brands have been hit particularly hard as young people switch from spending on outfits to alternatives such as digital subscriptions and mobile phones while competition from online businesses remains intense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d4b883ef7400cbddc9ef720beaab9afccf185a/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a36387040cf1f23966449046a1f59716","title":"the traffic light exit strategy to free the uk from lockdown","story":"A new economics paper suggests a red-amber-green solution to safely ease us out of coronavirus restrictionsBritain has been in lockdown for two weeks and it has been the grimmest of fortnights. The number of daily deaths from Covid-19 has continued to rise steadily and large chunks of the economy have been brought to a standstill.As yet, there are few hard numbers to judge the economic impact, but the collapse seen in the past few weeks is without precedent both in its speed and its severity. The increase in the numbers applying for universal credit suggest that unemployment is rising rapidly despite the government schemes to support both the employed and the self-employed.The aim of the Treasury and the Bank of England is to get the UK through the crisis with a minimum of scarring. Hence there are loan guarantees designed to prevent businesses that were perfectly viable a month ago from going bust as a result of the shutdown. The hope is that wage subsidies will prevent workers from losing touch with the labour market and becoming long-term unemployed.Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, said last week that it was unrealistic for the government to keep the lockdown in place indefinitely and that if it went on for months on end there would be a rebellion against it.That assessment is almost certainly right. The government does need an exit strategy but it is also being warned by epidemiologists that if the restrictions are relaxed too soon the virus could return. A second lockdown would not just be hugely unpopular, it would also magnify the economic damage.The government says any decisions it takes on ending the lockdown will be based on science, but the scientists don’t always agree. That’s because they are using models and these have limitations. Why? Because the results of epidemiological models depend on what is fed into them, and this requires the scientists to make a number of assumptions about human behaviour.This is a point made by Gerard Lyons and Paul Ormerod in an important new paper that might just offer the government the sort of exit strategy that King was talking about. Lyons and Ormerod do not dispute that a lockdown was necessary. Indeed, they think that the government’s initial idea that the population would develop “herd immunity” to the virus was dangerous nonsense.The evidence from other countries is that social distancing, shutting the restaurants and bars, discouraging unnecessary travel and getting people to work from home if they can does have an impact.Before the lockdown began, estimates suggested that on average each person with the virus infected between two and 3.5 other people. Without action, the virus would have carried on spreading, putting intolerable pressure on the NHS and killing many more people. This is known as the reproduction number: if it is above one, someone who is infected will pass it on to more than one person. If it less than one, it will fade away. The experience of China and Italy is that lockdowns will get the reproduction number below one.But the danger is that the reproduction number could go back up again if Britain went straight back to business as usual the moment the lockdown restrictions were lifted. If people celebrated en masse by going to the pub, to the football or by having a street party, there would be risk that the reproduction number would go up again and the virus would return. It is this possibility that concerns the epidemiologists.Taken to extremes, this would involve continuing the lockdown until there was no longer a risk of someone with the virus infecting anyone else and so ensuring that no one dies. But as Lyons and Ormerod points out, a similar approach would involve the banning of all road traffic to prevent the nearly 2,000 deaths a year on the road in Britain.Instead, they suggest that the return to normal life takes place under a traffic light system that will exploit the fact that people are going to be a lot more cautious in their behaviour after the crisis than they were before.“If people revert very quickly to the patterns of behaviour before the crisis, the epidemiological models are correct. There would be a second wave of infections. But behaviour will be different, either because of the lessons people have learned during this crisis, or because of the constraints placed upon them by rules and regulations.”The paper suggests that phase one of the process involves moving from lockdown to red. In this period, more but not all shops would open and they would have to observe the strict social distancing currently seen in supermarkets. Travel would be discouraged and many international flights banned.In the amber phase, unlimited car journeys would be allowed, and the wearing of face masks and disposable gloves would be mandatory on public transport. Restaurants would be allowed to open only if they had strict seating demarcations to keep people at a safe distance.It would only be when the light turned to green that any sort of sporting event or other mass gatherings, such as music festivals could take place, and the churches, temples and mosques open their doors.Inevitably there will be those with different views about what should be included in the red, amber and green phases. But it’s worth noting that Lyons was once an adviser to Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London. The prime minister might just be listening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b354bcca1c72adf2f40a6a7488afd02c39e524f7/0_196_3000_1797/master/3000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23b8ea610049977a954258fb0ff2b8c4","title":"keir starmer won the party handsomely now he must start convincing the nation","story":"Labour’s new leader will need to show that he has the capacity to grab the attention and capture the imagination of votersTalking about Keir Starmer, one Labour MP recently asked a colleague: “Is he another Ed Miliband?” The question was the more pointed because the person posing it was none other than Ed Miliband himself, the ex-leader responsible for one of the quadruple election defeats suffered by Labour in the last decade.Miliband Mark II, a closet Blairite and a 21st-century version of Harold Wilson: a variety of labels have been applied to Mr Starmer. He has become irritated by it, protesting that “I don’t need someone else’s name tattooed to my head”. Yet he has invited these speculative attempts to define him by spending the long months of the leadership campaign deliberately eluding a precise ideological identity.That was based on the calculation that keeping it vague was the way to maximise his support. The cautiously calibrated route that he chose to take to the Labour leadership largely eschewed taking any positions that would ide party opinion. This pleased activists who wanted to draw a line under the bitter factionalism of the Corbyn years. His victory statement on Saturday morning, echoing the relentless mantra of his campaign speeches, again called for unity.Unity around what? He says he wants Labour to be both “radical” and “relevant”. Who among them is going to say that they want to be “reactionary” and “irrelevant”? He has spoken warmly about the legacy of the Corbyn years, while also saying that the party should rehabilitate the New Labour era. “Don’t trash the last Labour government and don’t trash the last four years.” He has suggested that the last manifesto was “overloaded” with too many promises, while at the same time issuing “10 pledges” that committed himself to a lot of Corbynite policy. The reward for this face-all-ways approach was to be swept into the leadership with a majority of first preference votes in every section of the electoral college and a very wide spectrum of support. He had the backing of people intimately associated with New Labour as well as those who were fervent admirers of Mr Corbyn. The downside of such a sprawling coalition is that this leaves a lot of potential scope for disappointment.The leftwingers who supported Mr Starmer are generally assuming he will put a more credible face on a Corbynite programme. They will be expecting him to stay faithful to its central tenets and are likely to react with angry cries of betrayal if he doesn’t. He also attracted a lot of backing from the centre-left, including New Labour luminaries such as Charlie Falconer and Andrew Adonis. Mr Starmer took their support for granted during the contest, while he concentrated on wooing the left with activist-soothing pieties about the superiority of socialist values. The Labour centrists are assuming that he will reorient the party towards what they would call more sensible positions. “He’s got two very different kinds of supporters,” notes one very senior Labour figure. “They can’t both be right about him.”He starts with some clear advantages. One is that it will be hard to be worse than Jeremy Corbyn, author of such a dreadful defeat that Labour’s parliamentary representation is crushed down to its lowest level since 1935. Mr Starmer can harvest some early credits by restoring professionalism to Labour as an opposition. Labour MPs expect, and Tories agree, that he will do a much better job of holding the government to account. As the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, he comes to the task of leadership with senior experience of running a complex organisation. It can be an advantage that he came into the Commons just five years ago. Having become an MP later in life than most, he is not encumbered by an accumulation of historical obligations and debts to colleagues. “Keir is a loner really, not at all clubbable. He is one of the least cronyistic people I know,” comments a fellow Labour lawyer. That ought to leave him free to make frontbench appointments based on merit. The shadow cabinet will be recast to remove Corbyn-loyalist duds and make better use of the talent pool on the Labour benches that has been under used in recent years. He will have a fight, which he must win, to remove the Corbyn acolytes at party headquarters. A leader is never properly in charge of a party unless he can count on the loyalty of the general secretary and other key officials.An early test of his mettle will be how he tackles antisemitism. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is due to report on whether Labour became an institutionally racist party during its calamitous experiment with Corbynism. A damning report will suit Mr Starmer if he uses it to make good on the promise in his victory statement to “tear out this poison by its roots”. He has indicated that he would support the automatic expulsion of any member found guilty of antisemitism, a position that will meet resistance among those on the left who will condemn it as a purge. Taking a robust, no-tolerance approach to antisemitism would allow the new leader to demonstrate to the public that Labour is now under a very different kind of management.Ah, yes, the electorate. Remember them, Labour? The party has been talking to itself rather than the country during the many months of a leadership contest so interminable that Britain was still a member of the EU when nominations opened. Yet voters will ultimately be the arbiters of whether Mr Starmer can put his party on the road to recovery or merely adds his name to the lengthening roster of failed Labour leaders.He won the leadership in part on the grounds of “electability”, which is a way of saying that he meets conventional expectations of what a potential prime minister ought to look and sound like. “Keir passes the ‘shut your eyes’ test,” says one supporter. “You can shut your eyes and imagine him standing outside Number 10.”That is a necessary quality in someone who aspires to be prime minister, but it is not an entirely sufficient one. Successful political leaders also require a capacity to grab the attention and capture the imagination of voters. Tony Blair and David Cameron are the last two leaders to take their respective parties from opposition into power. Both had a talent for persuading the public that they had changed their parties for the better. Both combined that skill with an ability to convince the country that they had a plausible plan for national renewal.In this critical respect, Mr Starmer has yet to prove himself. The words most often used when admirers describe him are decent, pleasant, diligent, forensic, moral, sensible, clever, collaborative and credible. You never hear him called exciting, captivating, entertaining, rousing, surprising or inspirational. He has yet to mint a cut-through zinger such as “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime”. There’s no memorable phrase associated with his name.Some of his allies think an unflamboyant style will commend him to voters as they grow tired of what a Starmer-supporting Labour MP calls “Boris Johnson’s histrionic blustering”. Other Labour parliamentarians, and this includes some who are broadly hopeful about his leadership, reckon this is complacent. One former member of the shadow cabinet recently remarked to me: “I worry that Keir and his team are underestimating just how difficult it can be to get yourself a hearing as the opposition.”That challenge will be even tougher for as long as the coronavirus crisis is so all-consuming that it eats the rest of the news. A first test of his leadership will be how he calibrates scrutiny of ministerial handling of the pandemic. He said yesterday that he would “engage constructively with the government” and not score “party political points” or make “impossible demands”. This reflects an instinct to try to be statesmanlike. He will have a fine line to walk. Be overly cautious about calling out ministerial blundering and he will be accused of being too soft. Be too aggressive and he will be charged with stoking panic and fear.His longer-term prospects will be shaped by what sort of country emerges from this crisis. The victory speech - “we can see a better future” - hoped for a post-coronavirus Britain that has a more collectivist spirit that places greater value on public services and their key workers. The optimists in Camp Starmer believe that the emergency will leave the public dissatisfied with the vaudeville style of performative politics personified by the current prime minister and ready to rediscover an appetite for more sober-sided politicians. There is one thing that no one says about Keir Starmer. He is never called frivolous. That will do him a power of good if Britain decides that serious times call for serious people.• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94da8b7fa75460912f7770ad2b30c72a2d090661/0_64_5184_3110/master/5184..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c523260f8b638a761fd119a404952f3","title":"whether in the uk or the developing world were not all in coronavirus together","story":"In the slums of Delhi or Lagos, social distancing is a dream while social exclusion is all too real and pernicious‘The virus does not discriminate,” suggested Michael Gove after both Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, were struck down by Covid-19. But societies do. And in so doing, they ensure that the devastation wreaked by the virus is not equally shared.We can see this in the way that the low paid both disproportionately have to continue to work and are more likely to be laid off in the sacking of an Amazon worker for leading a protest against unsafe conditions in the rich having access to coronavirus tests denied to even most NHS workers.But to see most clearly how societies allow the virus to discriminate, look not at London or Rome or New York but at Delhi and Johannesburg and Lagos. Here, “social distancing” means something very different than it does to Europeans or Americans. It is less about the physical space between people than the social space between the rich and poor that means only the privileged can maintain any kind of social isolation.In the Johannesburg township of Alexandra, somewhere between 180,000 and 750,000 people live in an estimated 20,000 shacks. Through it runs South Africa’s most polluted river, the Jukskei, whose water has tested positive for cholera and has run black from sewage. Makoko is often called Lagos’s “floating slum” because a third of the shacks are built on stilts over a fetid lagoon. No one is sure how many people live there, but it could be up to 300,000. Dharavi, in Mumbai, is the word’s largest slum. Like Makoko and Alexandra, it nestles next to fabulously rich areas, but the million people estimated to live there are squashed into less than a square mile of land that was once a rubbish tip.In such neighbourhoods, what can social distancing mean? Extended families often live in one- or two-room shacks. The houses may be scrubbed and well kept but many don’t have lavatories, electricity or running water. Communal latrines and water points are often shared by thousands. Diseases from diarrhoea to typhoid stalked such neighbourhoods well before coronavirus.South Africa, Nigeria and India have all imposed lockdowns. Alexandra and Dharavi have both reported their first cases of coronavirus. But in these neighbourhoods, the idea of protecting oneself from coronavirus must seem as miraculous as clean water.Last week, tens of thousands of Indian workers, suddenly deprived of the possibility of pay, and with most public transport having been shut down, decided to walk back to their home villages, often hundreds of miles away, in the greatest mass exodus since partition. Four out of five Indians work in the informal sector. Almost 140 million, more than a quarter of India’s working population, are migrants from elsewhere in the country. Yet their needs had barely figured in the thinking of policymakers, who seemed shocked by the actions of the workers.India’s great exodus shows that “migration” is not, as we imagine in the west, merely external migration, but internal migration, too. Internal migrants, whether in India, Nigeria or South Africa, are often treated as poorly as external ones and often for the same reason – they are not seen as “one of us” and so denied basic rights and dignities. In one particularly shocking incident, hundreds of migrants returning to the town of Bareilly, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, were sprayed by officials with chemicals usually used to sanitise buses. They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too.All this should make us think harder about what we mean by “community”. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country.But the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine. When Donald Trump reportedly offers billions of dollars to a German company to create a vaccine to be used exclusively for Americans, when Germany blocks the export of medical equipment to Italy, when Britain, unlike Portugal, refuses to extend to asylum seekers the right to access benefits and healthcare during the coronavirus crisis, each does so in the name of protecting a particular community or nation.The rhetoric of community and nation can become a means not just to discount those deemed not to belong but also to obscure isions within. In India, Narendra Modi’s BJP government constantly plays to nationalist themes, eulogising Mother India, or Bhārat Mata. But it’s a nationalism that excludes many groups, from Muslims to the poor. In Dharavi and Alexandra and Makoko, and many similar places, it will not simply be coronavirus but also the willingness of the rich, both in poor countries and in wealthier nations, to ignore gross inequalities that will kill.In Britain in recent weeks, there has been a welcome, belated recognition of the importance of low-paid workers. Yet in the decade before that, their needs were sacrificed to the demands of austerity, under the mantra of “we’re all in it together”. We need to beware of the same happening after the pandemic, too, of the rhetoric of community and nation being deployed to protect the interests of privileged groups. We need to beware, too, that in a world that many insist will be more nationalist, and less global, we don’t simply ignore what exists in places such as Alexandra and Makoko and Dharavi.“We’re all at risk from the virus,” observed Gove. That’s true. It is also true that societies, both nationally and globally, are structured in ways that ensure that some face far more risk than others – and not just from coronavirus.

After his YouTube videos went viral, he gave up his day job to pursue a full-time career in comedy. He now co-writes and stars in his own sitcom, Man Like Mobeen, the third series of which has just arrived on BBC One (Mondays at 10.45pm).How are you coping with coronavirus shutdown?Still alive innit, so that’s a positive. You’ve got to take the positives where you can because it’s a mad mess out there. We’re being good and following government guidelines. Everyone has to take this seriously. Don’t go out, people. Stay in the house and shag instead.Just before the lockdown, you did standup in the US for the first time. How did it go?A bit weird. When the MC introduced me and I walked onstage, a couple of guys in the front row immediately tutted, folded their arms and started frowning. I took that as a challenge. That’s the beauty of standup. Within 10 minutes you can go from “I can’t believe they gave this Muslim a microphone” to “I love this dude, he’s hilarious”.How would you describe Man Like Mobeen to newcomers?In some ways it’s a traditional sitcom in the vein of Only Fools and Horses, but we felt the show was in a unique position to make you think as well as laugh. We discuss issues like racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, police prejudice…Art Malik plays a crime boss in the new series. How was working with him?He’s a legend. Looking at casting tapes, we were like: “If we don’t get Art Malik, the show is ruined.” When he arrived on set, we tried to be clever and discuss how he perceived the role. He turned around and said: “Guys, just tell me what the fuck to say and I’ll say it.”You’ve been called “the new face of British Muslims”. Is that a pressure?It’s impossible to always say the right thing and please everyone. I felt one responsibility and that was to Small Heath in Birmingham – an area often maligned in the local media. I wanted people here to feel proud and identify with the characters. The overwhelming majority were happy, so I am too.Do you get criticism from the Muslim community too?Of course. Usually about swearing. Somebody messaged me on Instagram asking why I’d said “shit”, so I clicked on their profile and there was a clip of Nicki Minaj twerking! The Muslim community is a complicated set of people. All I can do is try to speak the truth.You’re also up against Ross Kemp, RuPaul and David Attenborough…Imagine that party! Let’s set it up as soon as quarantine ends.You launched a scheme for local youngsters to get paid experience on your production team. Why?Our crew are incredible and I love them to bits but they’re overwhelmingly white dudes. I can talk the talk but unless I facilitate it, I’m a paigon, as Stormzy says. We do a good job of representation on-screen but wanted to get working-class kids behind the camera too. A few comedians are former teachers – like Romesh Ranganathan and Dawn French. What makes it good preparation for standup?Broadly there are two types of teachers. Ones who are all about the curriculum and imparting knowledge, then ones who understand that we have human beings sat in front of us who are going through all kinds of shit every day, so let’s chat to them and entertain them. The second type are the ones who become comics. There’s no better training in crowd-work and navigating emotions. That tough gig in America was nothing compared with a year 9 girls’ health and social care lesson. Those girls were danger.Do your former pupils come to gigs and watch you on TV?They do, which is a lot of fun, but they’ve grown up so quick. One girl came to see me recently and her boyfriend looked about 40. I felt like calling the police! Who were your comedy heroes growing up?Eddie Murphy and Dave Chappelle. From the UK, Lee Evans and Peter Kay. Chris Morris is so unique too. But none of them compares with my old dear, who lives next door to me now. Pound-for-pound, she’s the funniest person you could hope to meet. I said the other day, “Mum, we should do a show together” and she was like “Do I look like Romesh’s mum, mate?” There’s no messing with her.The BBC comes in for a lot of criticism. What do you think of it?It’s such a broad-ranging organisation. It’s a fragmented eco-system, staffed by people with completely contradictory opinions. These are confusing times, but without the BBC it would be a lot worse.What’s next for you?I’m trying to write a sitcom about my teaching days. Let’s face it, there’s plenty of time to write at the moment. Right now is the time for creating ideas. Not just for me, but for anyone. If you’re working in an Amazon factory and can’t take much more, download an app called Final Draft and start writing.

Then I found a record of Emma Joan’s birth and it fell into place.”The tunnel was completed in 1841 and the supposed rising sun phenomenon was first reported by the Devizes Gazette a year later. It surfaced from time to time over the decades and added to Brunel’s legend as a genius with a mischievous sense of humour.In April 2017 the line was shut because of engineering work, providing Great Western Railway and Network Rail with a rare chance to observe whether the sun really does shine through the length of the tunnel on 9 April. Teams positioned themselves at the eastern and western ends of the tunnel and waited for the sun to rise. Disappointingly, they had to conclude that it did not quite beam all the way through.This was no surprise to Maggs and others who have analysed the science and concluded that in fact a more probable date for the phenomenon was 6 or 7 April. So he took a different tack. “I thought I’d come at it another way – from the social angle rather than the scientific one,” he said.Maggs began to investigate Brunel’s life and times to try to find out whether 6 or 7 April were significant dates for him. Eventually he tracked down Emma Joan’s baptism certificate, which gave her date of birth as 6 April 1803.Brunel’s older sister, Sophia, was known as a spirited and powerful woman, but Emma Joan tends to be forgotten and was dismissed by an early Brunel biographer as “dim and rather ailing”.Maggs, from Chelmsford, Essex, likes the idea that Brunel might have paid tribute to his younger sister by designing in a trick of the light.But might it just be coincidence? “As to whether he really intended it, I reckon it’s 5050,” said Maggs. “But the fact remains he did have a great sense of fun. It is possible. If he had done it for his birthday and he had been found out he would have come under a load of opprobrium from shareholders. It’s a lovely thought that he did it for his sister.“Whether Brunel really intended this or it was just a happy accident we may never know, unless a scholar someday uncovers a previously unknown letter or document from Brunel either proving or disproving the fact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19792f504a267f311fff7eedb4fb97321f644ba8/931_0_3454_2073/master/3454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbbd9487b3e2b3ce26102198ad536caf","title":"this weeks best culture indoors from trolls on tour to lockdown with miranda hart","story":"The Observer’s critics recommend the best new arts shows to enjoy on TV, on the radio and onlineTrolls World TourGreat news for families under lockdown: one of the few blockbuster titles braving a digital-only release is this candy-coloured sequel to the ultra-peppy animated musical phenomenon.

A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our focus is making sure that the 1.3 million disadvantaged children who would normally have a free school meal on a school day do not go hungry as a result of staying home.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f259ccc6f9e0cb344c168b193f52539e93890bcf/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1b09fdaf5987ca2b0d644936f48761e","title":"what wildlife can you see from your home coronavirus","story":"If you are locked down in an urban area due to coronavirus, we want to know what flora and fauna you can see from your homeLocked down in a city?

Perhaps we humans are not as special as we would like to thinkI had hoped to interview the plant neurobiologist Stefano Mancuso at his laboratory at the University of Florence. I picture it as a botanical utopia: a place where flora is respected for its awareness and intelligence where sensitive mimosa plants can demonstrate their long memories and where humans are invited to learn how to be a better species by observing the behaviour of our verdant fellow organisms.But because we are both on lockdown, we Skype from our homes. Instead of meeting his clever plants, I make do with admiring a pile of cannonball-like pods from an aquatic species, on the bookshelves behind him. “They’re used for propagation,” he says. “I am always collecting seeds.”Before Mancuso’s lab started work in 2005, plant neurobiology was largely seen as a laughable concept. “We were interested in problems that were, until that moment, just related to animals, like intelligence and even behaviour,” he says. At the time, it was “almost forbidden” to talk about behaviour in plants. But “we study how plants are able to solve problems, how they memorise, how they communicate, how they have their social life and things like that”.Mancuso and his colleagues have become experts in training plants, just like neuroscientists train lab rats. If you let a drop of water fall on a Mimosa pudica, its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves, but, if you continue doing so, the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting. The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks, even when their living conditions, such as lighting, are changed. “That was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories, in the range of one or two days – the average memory of insects,” says Mancuso. “To find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise.” Not least because they don’t have brains.One of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso’s work is the idea of plant consciousness. As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence, not to mention human intelligence, the always-contentious term consciousness has become the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate. “Let’s use another term,” Mancuso suggests. “Consciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages. Let’s talk about awareness. Plants are perfectly aware of themselves.” A simple example is when one plant overshadows another – the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light. But when you look into the crown of a tree, all the shoots are heavily shaded. They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves. “So they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside,” says Mancuso.Science struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric, he argues. One test for self-awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves. “Very few animals are able to do this,” says Mancuso. “Humans, dolphins, a few apes and probably elephants. This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self-awareness.” Mancuso believes this is wrong. “My personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself. For me, it’s impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent, to solve problems.”Another misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state – incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them. But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals. “And this is not an opinion. This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence. We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least 20 different chemical and physical parameters, many of which we are blind to.” There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet, and we would have no idea, whereas “plants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil”, he says.Far from being silent and passive, plants are social and communicative, above ground and beneath, through their roots and fungal networks. They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms. They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger, deter predators and attract pollinating insects. When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, for example, the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars.Plants respond to sound, too, “feeling” vibrations all over. “Plants are extremely good at detecting specific kinds of sounds, for example at 200hz or 300hz … because they are seeking the sound of running water.” If you put a source of 200hz sound close to the roots of a plant, he says, they will follow it. There is no evidence that the human voice benefits plants, although talking to plants may soothe the humans doing it.Another reason we overlook plants’ intelligence is their vastly slower pace of life. In Mancuso’s new book, The Incredible Journey of Plants, we meet the world’s oldest plant – Old Tjikko – a red fir tree whose roots have writhed in the Swedish earth for about 9,560 years. We are also introduced to the ingenious seeds of crimson fountain grass, which choose not to germinate until the conditions are perfect – and can survive for six years while waiting.The main thrust of the book is that plants were the original pioneers and have been forever exploring the planet. Mancuso eschews the notion of “native species” and prizes so-called invasive species above all else. “The more invasive they are, the more I like them, because they are the most brilliant example of the ability to solve problems,” he says. “Invasive species are the most beautiful plants that I can imagine.” For Mancuso, “migration is one of the most important forces of nature. All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural.” Although new generations of botanists are increasingly embracing plant neurobiology, Mancuso still has his detractors. Last summer, a group of eight plant scientists wrote in the journal Trends in Plant Science that Mancuso and his colleagues “have consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural, organisational and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge”. Mancuso says that almost all of these botanists are retired. “It’s an older generation of plant scientists that is completely against any notion of a plant as intelligent or behaving. For them, plants are kind of a semi-living organic machine.”The notion that humans are the apex of life on Earth is one of the most dangerous ideas around, says Mancuso: “When you feel yourself better than all the other humans or other living organisms, you start to use them. This is exactly what we’ve been doing. We felt ourselves as outside nature.” The average life of a species on Earth is between 2m and 5m years. “Homo sapiens have lived just 300,000 years,” he says – and already “we have been able to almost destroy our environment. From this point of view, how can we say that we are better organisms?”Perhaps we should try – ahem – taking a leaf out of the plant kingdom’s book. Human societies and organisations are structured like our bodies – with a brain, or a top-level control centre, and various different organs governing specific functions. “We use this in our universities, our companies, even our class isions,” says Mancuso. This structure enables us to move fast, physically and organisationally, but it also leaves us vulnerable. If a major organ fails, it could scupper everything, and top-down leadership rarely serves the whole.Plants, by contrast, “are kind of horizontal, diffusive, decentralised organisations that are much more in line with modernity”. Take the internet, the ultimate decentralised root system. “Look at the ability of Wikipedia to produce a wonderful amount of good-quality information by using a decentralised, diffused organisation. I’m claiming that, by studying plant networks, we can find wonderful solutions for us,” Or take the ethos of cooperation. Plants, say Mancuso, “are masters of starting symbiotic relationships with other organisms: bacteria, mushrooms, insects, even us. Just look at the way they use us to be transported all around the world.” We may think we have the upper hand, but plants may beg to differ.The Incredible Journey of Plants by Stefano Mancuso is published by Penguin Random House USA"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5a223d27b4697a7edd0427775ed1e5d0381f85d/0_434_3007_1804/master/3007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e8198fc71724006581a6610e59a698f","title":"down to a vintage tee pulling on a piece of history vintage tshirts","story":"Cool memorabilia, subcultural signifier – and now big business... Why the vintage T-shirt now gets top billingIn the new, rebooted TV version of High Fidelity, Nick Hornby’s Rob, previously played by John Cusack, is a queer woman of colour played by Zoë Kravitz. The nerdish, music snobbery of the original novel prevails alongside jokes about Creed and soliloquies about getting rid of Michael Jackson’s entire oeuvre, vintage music T-shirts are a battleground.A Cheap Trick tee gets ridiculed, a Miseducation of Lauryn Hill one becomes shorthand for Rob’s co-worker’s tastes and ambitions, and an accidentally destroyed vintage Joy Division T-shirt becomes a metaphor for a toxic relationship. Rob herself mixes achingly cool girl grams (cardigans, DM boots, Matrix jackets) with Wu Tang Clan and Beastie Boys (License to III era) tops. Why those bands? “They’re both awesome and represent going your own way whether it’s deemed cool or not,” says the show’s costume designer Sarah Laux.A vintage rock T-shirt obsessive herself (she’s been collecting them for 20 years), she sees the unspoken meaning behind the T-shirt: “They show a level of commitment to the history of music,” she says. “Rob is no different. Having a vintage T-shirt from a classic band is like having a piece of history.”Similarly on HBO’s Insecure, Issa Rae’s character, Issa, has an equally enviable wardrobe of vintage tees: Public Enemy, Nina Simone and Prince. In the show they are used both as an expression of the characters’ personalities and a narrative wink to what’s going on in the plot.“Early on during the pilot process, we talked about Issa’s style feeling nostalgic,” says Ayanna James, the show’s costume designer. “I purchased a few vintage band tees for Issa to wear at the end of the first episode.” James wanted the show to have the T-shirts articulate what Issa was going through. “Specifically during season 2, I would plug in shirts that matched Issa’s mood.”As well as being a fashion talking point, it’s also big business. Pre-loved T-shirts from Wu Tang or Backstreet Boys can go for £500 or more on resale sites. “There’s a lot of $1,500 band T-shirts out there,” Laux says. She’s seen a Sonic Youth T-shirt go for $2,000. “People are interested in having items of clothing that have lived a life and that are essentially one-of-a-kind pieces.”In 2011, HMV started making extra space for their vintage tee selection, clocking the growing nostalgia market and that music fans would pick up a T-shirt, mug and possibly badge along with the commemorative reissue of their favourite album. “We were seeing a massive increase,” says chief buyer Gary Williamson. In a world lived through screens, there’s more value in the “nostalgia economy” where the connection to the past is of a high premium. Going analogue also plays out in a physical way. “I actually think that the vinyl renaissance is the older sibling of the current T-shirt trend,” says James Goodhead, co-founder of Unified Goods – a bespoke vintage T-shirt company. He says that the visual appeal of vintage T-shirts has a unique quality. “The way cotton and screen-printed graphics can age over the decades can be mesmerising – it really draws you in,” he says.“People want a feeling of belonging to a movement or an era,” says Goodhead. It’s something that Urban Outfitters think about when they consider which vintage T-shirts to stock. “We split them into stories based on what feels like a trend,” says Ruth Higginson, urban renewal buyer for the shop.But it’s not just bands, it’s also brands who are seeing the value in cashing in on nostalgic fetishisation. The biggest sellers at Unified Goods are associated with 90s skater chic, 50s beat poetry icons and contemporary artists. “Most roads lead back to pivotal, subcultural happenings,” Goodhead says. The company curates the eras that they deem relevant: on their homepage are T-shirts featuring the 90s recycle symbol, Panasonic and Mawell T-shirts and a Phantom of the Opera tee.Another consequence of social media is that the fashion cycles have sped up, so trends are coming up quickly and the idea of what “vintage” means has changed. Now when we use the term we’re not just using it in reference to a floral blouse that looks like it’s from the Second World War, we could be talking about a bucket hat from the 1990s or a boxy, shoulder-padded suit jacket from the 1980s. Goodhood recently launched a vintage T-shirt range which showcased old tech logos from Apple to the disintegrating Microsoft square.Co-founder of Goodhood Kyle Stewart thinks that the products will resonate with “anyone who is aware of a brand’s current status and is misty-eyed for the simplicity of brands 20 years ago. The old branding of the vintage Apple products is relatively quaint compared to their contemporary appearance.”More recently, Unified Goods have collaborated with the Tate Modern for the big Andy Warhol retrospective, providing vintage Warhol-related merchandise from the 1970s to the 1990s. What would the prince of pop art have made of the vintage T-shirt trend? “He would have loved it, for sure,” says Goodhead. “These T-shirts have almost become small works of collectible art.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895882edc7da450f06c5f52322069a65db7616b8/542_2204_4931_2957/master/4931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a9b38b1091f49d1efe68f5303c457d4","title":"nigel slater recipes pine kernel and lemon cookies and sultana and cranberry sponge","story":"Baking is always such a comfort, from nut cookies to a nice steamed pudThe first pan of pine kernels went up in expensive smoke, so I watched the second batch of diminutive, creamy-white nuts as intently as a hawk might watch a family of field mice, toasting them until they were evenly pale golden in colour.I folded some of them into a sticky, marzipan and lemon-scented biscuit dough, while the rest were used to freckle the surface once the biscuits were rolled and ready to bake.I played around a lot with the recipe, finally adding enough egg white to allow the cookies to spread like brandy snaps on the baking sheet, their uneven surface pitted with nuts and crystals of almond paste. You could call them biscuits, because the texture is crisp, like ice, their deckled edges shattering when snapped. But the centre is softly chewy thanks to the marzipan, so cookie might be a more appropriate description. Either way, they were what we wanted with a glass of vin santo in lieu of pudding.The following day was altogether colder and a proper pudding was called for. I hadn’t made a steamed pud in an age, so out came the old china bowl, the grease-proof paper and string, and I made a bee-line for the dried fruit shelf in the larder, to make a fat, amber-coloured dome dotted with vine-fruits and tart, garnet-red dried cherries.Eaten an hour or so after baking and these are soft, crumbly and cookie-like a few hours later and they become crisp and biscuity – the sort of thing to serve with coffee or a glass of sweet golden wine. (Dunking is a thoroughly good thing here.) The lemon zest and toasted pine-kernels lend an Italian note. They will keep for a fortnight in a biscuit tin. Makes 15-20 biscuitsLightly toast the pine kernels in a shallow pan until pale gold in colour, then set aside. Break the marzipan into large pieces and put them in the bowl of a food processor, then process briefly to large crumbs.Add the sugar to the marzipan, then finely grate the lemon zest and add to the bowl with 35g of the pine kernels. Process for a few seconds to combine and roughly chop the pine kernels. Stir in the flour. In a separate, medium-sized bowl beat the egg whites until almost stiff, then fold in the crumb mixture, mixing until thoroughly combined.Set the oven at 175Cgas mark 3-4. Line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper. Take 1 heaped tbsp of the mixture, roll it into a ball and then drop it into the reserved toasted pine kernels. Roll the cookie dough in the pine kernels, then place it on the lined baking sheet.Bake for 10-12 minutes until the cookies have spread. They should look slightly under-done. Remove from the oven and leave them for 10 minutes to settle before transferring them carefully to a cooling rack with a palette knife.I find it is best to leave the pudding in the switched-off pot, still covered by its lid, for a good 20 minutes before serving. You will need a 1.5 litre pudding basin, lightly buttered.

Cut the dried figs in half horizontally and place them, slightly overlapping, in the bottom of the pudding bowl.Break the eggs into a small bowl, beat them briefly with a fork, then add, little by little, to the butter and sugar, beating continuously.Mix together the flour, cinnamon, mixed spice and ground ginger. Finely grate the zest of the orange and combine with the flour. Gradually incorporate the flour into the batter, a couple of heaped tbsp at a time. Mix in the milk.Have ready a large, deep pan of boiling water. Put a trivet or similar object in the base of the pan for the basin to sit on. Chop the dates into four and mix with the dried fruits, then stir into the pudding mixture. Spoon into the pudding basin, on top of the figs and smooth the surface. If you are using a plastic pudding basin with a lid, then clip on the lid. If using a china basin, cover with a sheet of greaseproof paper, secure with string or a thick rubber band, then cover the top in foil and secure similarly.Carefully lower the pudding basin into the boiling water and lower the heat to a spirited bubble. Cover with a lid and leave to steam for 2 hours. It is essential to keep an eye on the water level. It should come two thirds of the way up the sides of the pudding basin. Top it up from the kettle as necessary. Remove from the heat and leave the pudding bowl in the hot water for 30 minutes, before removing the paper and foil, running a palette knife around the sides of the pudding and turning it out on to a shallow serving dish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96b9da090a09c3dac295bb17dd34e7739c5451d4/0_243_4282_2570/master/4282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be5e7a8d9bed84def38ec28d8b511734","title":"finishing school fortuna sittard young players brighton george cox english youngsters abroad","story":"Brighton’s George Cox is the latest to benefit at the Dutch club and says many more English youngsters should look abroad“Coming out here is definitely the best thing I’ve done,” George Cox says. The Brighton left-back is enjoying an interrupted season on loan at Fortuna Sittard, one of many players taking advantage of the chance to develop in the Ereisie.Fortuna are open about their transfer policy: they acquire young talent and give them the opportunity to play top-flight matches. The aim is to build up the players and sell them on. Loanees such as Cox have a clause allowing the club to sign them permanently and a chance regardless to show whether they are up to the rigours of the professional game.At the start of the season Cox could have dropped down the isions in England or moved to the Netherlands. “For my development, I have learned so much over the year. League Two just isn’t the best decision and sometimes it’s sprung on people, as there is an attitude that you need to work your way up in England, but some people need to try something new and going abroad is definitely the best thing.”Cox had a spell at Northampton in League Two last season during which he was limited to five appearances but he has played 21 games for Fortuna, becoming a regular under the manager, Sjors Ultee, and his assistant Kevin Hofland, a former Netherlands international who knows a thing or two about defending.Todd Cantwell also had a spell at Fortuna before returning to Norwich, where he has proved himself in the Premier League. Cox’s time in the Netherlands has seen him attract attention and numerous scouts have watched him. Given the very technical style of England’s best academies, Cox feels more people in situations similar to his should consider broadening their horizons.Within the Fortuna squad there are players on loan from clubs across Europe, including Valencia, Borussia Dortmund and Juventus, a sign they have a wide net and are trusted to develop youngsters. “I think for many years ours is the best development league for young players,” Hofland says. “I felt this when I was a player, too. When I went abroad I saw different things. I learned things in the academies in Holland and then at 23 or 24, I went away.The different perspective from Hofland has helped Cox in his understanding of the game. When football returns after the coronavirus crisis, Fortuna are due to continue their fight against relegation. Cox appreciates the importance of every game but says that could apply in England’s lower isions, too. “The difference is that I get to play against top players most weeks, whereas in League Two it’s not like that. The opportunity to go to Ajax and PSV away, I think that’s what sold it to me mainly.”The next steps for anyone in football are a uncertain. Cox is out of contract in the summer and is waiting to find out whether Fortuna will make his deal permanent. Alternatively, he could continue his career elsewhere whether in the UK or abroad. Whatever the next chapter, Cox is thankful for this season’s experience: “I have been at Brighton since I was 10 years old and I haven’t stepped out of my comfort zone properly. It has been the perfect place for me to come and develop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7b31de2d122eee62c1b613bd098322beb2e889/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b8d15266f2cb5224f06a8c957b5d43","title":"thousands of casual workers at major football stadiums left without pay","story":"Thousands of casual workers at some of English football’s biggest stadiums have been left unpaid during the Covid-19 shutdown, the  understands.A number of employees from Delaware North – which provides catering and hospitality services at venues such as the Emirates Stadium, London Stadium, Wembley, Craven Cottage and the Ricoh Arena – have contacted the  after seeing booked shifts cancelled and receiving no payments since the Premier League season halted last month.Some of the workers, who are on zero-hour or casual arrangements, feel increasingly desperate. The casual workers complain the company has told them there are no shifts for them because of the impact of Covid-19 and that it is trying to establish whether they are eligible to be furloughed under the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme.The situation puts Arsenal and West Ham at risk of embarrassment. Both clubs announced they would continue paying their casual employees as normal while fixtures are not taking place and there is no suggestion that this is not the case. But their statements left unclear the fact that a sizeable majority of casual work – also including cleaning and security-based jobs – at matches and other events is undertaken by workers from contracted companies who do not operate on the clubs’ payrolls. Many Delaware North workers will be familiar faces to players, management and directors at both Premier League clubs, some of whom will know them as colleagues they see numerous times over the course of a season.A long-standing casual employee at one of the venues told the  that they work there for up to five days a week but saw that income stream removed as soon as the season was paused. They said they had received no payment for the shifts they had committed to.Casual workers were sent an email on Saturday, seen by the , in which Delaware North said it was awaiting “definitive guidance” on whether they were eligible to be furloughed and that the company would make it a priority to put them on that scheme if possible.“We are taking legal advice but until there is definitive guidance allowing you to undertake paid work for others whilst on furlough we will be maintaining this cautious stance,” the email said. It added: “If you wish to work for another company at this time, think this is unfair, there is of course the option to ask to be P45’d so that you can accept an offer of work elsewhere. You are always more than welcome to re-register with us when this is over.”There is little other work available in a hospitality industry that has been ravaged by the Covid-19 crisis and there are also suggestions that some have had trouble applying for universal credit due to a lack of certainty about their status. Delaware North’s casual workforce encompasses a wide range of personal circumstances. For some it is a sole source of income, whereas others have a second job.Delaware North is yet to respond to a number of emails and phone messages.

The first time it happened was in the mid-70s. I’d recently left school and was a couple of months into an art foundation course at Manchester Polytechnic. I found myself on my own for a weekend in the flat I shared with two fellow students. Bored, I started rummaging down the back of the sofa to see what curiosities – or money – I might find. A moment later I pulled out a single stocking, which I immediately put on. Instinctively. Transgressively. It triggered years of guilt, self-disgust and confusion.So why did I put that stocking on?In the early 1960s, as a little kid, I’d watched my mother dress and, I think, just expected to grow up to be like her. However, I soon came to realise I was a boy, which I accepted… Until in my teens I came across an article in Oz magazine.Oz was a notorious alternative magazine and, as a rebellious, middle-class school kid, I sought out weird music, strange books and publications like International Times and the comics of underground cartoonists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. The piece in Oz was about a boy who wakes one morning to find himself transformed into a girl. In reality, it was an excuse to publish some titillating erotic photographs, but still… An idea had been planted and from that moment on I wasn’t content to be a boy.After the stocking incident, I started collecting items of girls’ clothing. I remember having a pair of tights and a pink one-piece swimsuit I’d rescued one holiday when my sister was having a clear-out. I kept them hidden at the back of a drawer and, when the compulsion became too strong, I’d wait until my flatmates were out and slip into them. All the while listening for a key in the front door and the creak of feet on the stairs.For years I agonised over why I was obsessed with dressing as a girl. Maybe there’d been a mess-up in my genes, or something had happened during my upbringing? Perhaps, God had made me like this… or maybe I even, somehow or other, decided it for myself. Whatever the reason – and eventually I decided the reason didn’t matter – I found myself floating through my late teens and 20s wishing I’d been born a girl and dressing as one in secret whenever the urge became irresistible. Afterwards, I’d be filled with feelings of sadness, fear and guilt. Sadness at being back in the real world of my male self fear of being discovered, and guilt at doing something I thought – no, I knew – was perverted and abnormal. I was clearly sick in the head.Back in the 60s and 70s transvestism was on a very long alphabetical list of sexual deviations. There were certainly no role models for a teenage boy obsessed with dressing as a girl. The only cross-dressers I ever saw were men playing women for laughs in films or on television – female impersonators such as Danny La Rue, comedians in the Carry On films or Monty Python’s Flying Circus. I was convinced that, dressed as a woman, I must look utterly ridiculous. A joke.Then, in 1981, something amazing happened. I moved to London and one day in a remainder bookshop found a copy of Dressing Up, Peter Ackroyd’s 1979 history of transvestism and drag. I learned that, for centuries, in almost every country in the world, men and women had worn each other’s clothes. I also saw Richard O’Brien’s Rocky Horror Picture Show – a glorious celebration of dressing up in women’s lingerie. It seemed I wasn’t quite as weird and alone as I’d thought.By the mid-80s my artwork was being published in newspapers and magazines and I couldn’t resist slipping my secret dressing-up obsession into my comic strips – disguised, of course. I peopled my cartoons with humans who feel compelled to dress as plants or fish aliens who camouflage themselves as coat hangers dissatisfied items of furniture – chairs, for example – who yearn to be tables. In my drawings, as in the real world, things weren’t always quite what they seemed.When the internet arrived in the 90s, one idle evening it occurred to me to type the word “transvestite” into an early search engine – and everything changed. Hundreds and thousands of pages of hits came down the wires and filled my computer screen. Millions of men, just like me, were wearing women’s clothes behind closed curtains and locked doors. I was not alone, I was one of many. If I was a pervert, then I was in the company of countless numbers of other perverts.Slowly, I started seeing cross-dressing as a positive, magical thing rather than a curse. In my arty way I began thinking of myself as transforming from a man into an exotic, mythical creature, like a faun, perhaps, except I was part boy and part girl, rather than part boy and part goat. In my head, putting on the clothes of the opposite sex gradually shifted from a sickness to feeling more like a delightfully naughty blessing. Dressing up was a way of stepping through a wardrobe from one world into another. It was liberating – and fun!I soon discovered there were clubs and events I could go to, from huge, all night dress-up parties where everyone with every possible kind of kink was welcome, such as Torture Garden, to more specifically trans-orientated clubs, like the WayOut – the first trans nightclub I ever went to.I remember my first visit vividly. The hours spent carefully applying makeup and trying on outfits the waiting until it got dark before daring to slip out of the house in case one of the neighbours saw me driving to the address convinced that everyone in the other cars could spot that I was a man sitting in the parked car until the street was deserted before opening the door and tottering, in unfamiliar shoes and skirt, to the club entrance. It was utterly terrifying and completely exhilarating at the same time.Transvestites began making appearances in my books and comic strips. A female version of myself featured in an episode of my BBC Radio 4 series, Steven Appleby’s Normal Life, and a musical play based on my work was titled Crocs in Frocks.Finally, I decided I’d had enough of leading a double life. My wife and siblings knew I cross-dressed – I’d come out to them in the late-90s, which had been terrifying because… what if they’d rejected me? Luckily they all accepted it as a part of my artistic temperament, I think. But, even so, I was finding that only being able to dress up once a week or so was stifling. I’d learned to be comfortable with being a transvestite and now I was desperate to be honest and open and live as one. Also, I had young children and wanted them to grow up knowing their father as a complete person, not someone with a huge secret that would – inevitably – come out… What effect might that have had on our relationship?I took to wearing increasingly androgynous clothes, jewellery, nail varnish and a little subtle makeup – being careful not to embarrass my boys at school parents’ evenings – and began opening up about my transvestism to friends and employers.Thankfully, I never had a bad response. And then one day 12 years ago, I went out with my wife and two of our closest female friends on a shopping expedition to select a wig. Trying on a dozen different styles in the wig shop was great fun, but nothing looked quite right until I put on perhaps the 10th or 11th and everyone said unanimously: “That’s the one!” I left the shop wearing new hair – and stepped into a new, trans life.Back home, I stuck my head through the door into the sitting room and the boys barely looked up from watching TV. They didn’t seem to notice my change. I asked them about it recently and they said: “Dad, you were always just you.”For many years now I haven’t owned a single item of male clothing. I’m trying to be me, so I am comfortable looking feminine, but continuing to be called Steven. Surely there don’t need to be any rules? And the boys – now young men – still call me Dad. Because, of course, however I have chosen to look, I’ll always be their dad.Dragman by Steven Appleby is published by Jonathan Cape at £18.99.

And yet its patterns have become wearyingly predictable for those in the US and the UK, which seem bound together not just by a “special relationship” but by a worrying inadequacy in government response.In the face of rising public fear and frustration, even the loyalist press on both sides of the Atlantic are toppling like treacherous dominos, pushed over by the not-so-slight touch of facts and existential threat.The bodies piling up in the makeshift morgues, the families and friends in hospital or worse, the sirens that sound all day and all night, are pieces of physical evidence ignored by only the most debased Twitter conspiracy theorist.  It was startling to see the Daily , the house journal of the Boris Johnson government, deliver the banner headline “Questions without answers” last week as the government fumbled to give any clear responses on the lack of testing and the projections for lockdown.“This testing shambles is unforgivable: when will ministers act?” asked the Daily Mail. Telling the public what they want to hear is suddenly out of fashion in partisan journalism. Instead, they are telling them what they need to hear. In public health, communication is everything. Policy and behavioural change is the target with Covid-19 and government accountability is the key.In the US, the unthinkable happened as Fox News, which rallied behind Donald Trump in the earliest days of his coronavirus denial, sharply changed its tune. It fired Trish Regan, a host on Fox Business, after a histrionic opening monologue to her show where she blamed “liberal media” for spreading “mass hysteria” and using the coronavirus as a tool for impeachment.Sean Hannity, the most high profile and Trump-aligned Fox personality, dropped the “Coronavirus hysteria” graphic from 9 March and replaced it with a more sombre “Facts over fear” tone a week later. It might be too late. A survey from the Pew Research Center’s Journalism and Media Project last week showed a stark ision in beliefs about the spread of the virus, according to which cable outlet viewers watched.In a world where facts have been treated as optional, particularly by Fox News’s main channel, the need for a shared belief in evidence-based coverage has now become a matter of life and death. An open letter from journalists and academics was sent to Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, and his son and Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch, detailing the ways in which the deliberate spread of misinformation on the channel was endangering lives: “Inexcusably, Fox News has violated elementary canons of journalism. In so doing, it has contributed to the spread of a grave pandemic.”Some of the more comfortable practices of government press relations, on both sides of the Atlantic, have also been put under the microscope. In the UK, the briefing of lobby correspondents on complex health issues is clearly not working. While it is important to know how the government is thinking and forming its strategy, it is also important that subject experts can ask the harder follow-up questions. Off-the-record briefings to favoured journalists, particularly those with a large broadcast presence, have long been standard practice. But there is something shockingly irresponsible about ideas such as the disastrous “herd immunity” strategy being laundered through a journalist, even one as well respected as ITV’s Robert Peston.Those with long memories will remember what a tour de force Peston was as a BBC journalist, breaking story after story on the financial collapse in 2008. As a highly skilled and experienced financial journalist, he was in the perfect position to understand and interrogate the information.Ten days ago, the US press was debating why it sends political journalists to the White House daily press briefings, rather than health correspondents. Now a number of high-profile outlets, including the Washington Post and the New York Times, are simply not sending correspondents to the briefings at all, as editors judge the news-free pantomime of a miniature Trump rally not worth the risk to reporters’ health.Cable and broadcast networks no longer, as a matter of course, carry the full two-hour rambling promotions. On a good day the medical expertise of Dr Anthony Fauci or Dr Deborah Birx comes to the fore, obscuring the boastful rambling of the president. On a bad day, you might get the Trump cheerleader and chief executive of MyPillow, Michael J Lindell, or Jared Kushner, the president’s ineffectual son-in-law.Not everything is worse than expected. If you had told New Yorkers, before the wave of a deadly pandemic broke over them, that the national hero of the catastrophe would be their governor, Andrew Cuomo, and his somewhat notorious powerpoint presentations, few would have believed it. Cuomo’s peacetime reputation as a political blunt instrument, whose policies have neither addressed inequality or fixed the subway, has been blown away by a wartime leader of gravity and directness, warmth and steel.Cuomo is Churchillian, in that his decidedly poor record on many peacetime political matters has been largely erased by getting the wartime calls right. Cuomo’s daily walk through the unvarnished numbers of New York City deaths, hospitalisations, availability of beds and ventilators, the expansion of emergency facilities, is nationally required viewing. The clarity of now, is reassuring in the grip of future uncertainty.Reliable clear information, presented in a clear understandable way, peppered with human empathy, goes a long way to papering over the yawning chasms of unpreparedness.We are by now used to thinking ahead about what might change after the pandemic is tamed. For politicians and the media, the change ought to be that we replace the current pantomime of government press relations with a more serious piece of policy theatre, or even a dose of reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0e7cf38ffff942decc68efd955e0a8e1b728ce/0_258_6439_3864/master/6439..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4f532a97ac8f61df6b636e09d736ad6","title":"dua lipa future nostalgia review","story":"A leak brought forward the release of Dua Lipa’s second album. Lady Gaga’s forthcoming LP Chromatica, by contrast, has been delayed in response to coronavirus. A cordon sanitaire should exist between the two, because Future Nostalgia is a pop behemoth, one that frequently recalls peak Gaga and any number of proven hitmakers.If the album’s title makes the bold claim that records-to-be will hark back to the second outing of this “female alpha” as a high-water mark, the British-Kosovan singer has actually succeeded in audaciously mulching several decades of party music into an album so relentless it doubles as a playlist.There are no tiresome ballads to curtail the female-positive forward motion, just an acerbic outro, Boys Will Be Boys, that mourns how girls grow up too fast. Big, obvious disco and 80s tropes loom large everywhere, notably on pre-album bangers such as Don’t Start Now or Physical.Elsewhere, aggressive basslines worm along and beats slap hard on Hallucinate, violins scythe mercilessly and cowbells clang. Best of all is the impeccably produced Pretty Please, where Dua Lipa pleads with a lover to stay, because he slows down the whirring of her mind.

But it will be balanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country. And of course it will be balanced in terms of ersity.”Asked if he would include some Blairites in his frontbench team, Starmer said he wanted to move on from such labels.“I will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election. It’ll be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet,” he said. “We’re not looking back, we’re not badging people by the past. We’re going forward to the future, focusing on how we win the 2024 general election.”The former shadow Brexit secretary, who was director of public prosecutions before entering parliament, faces a difficult first task of unifying Labour around a new shadow cabinet, including how to bring in MPs who felt shut out under Corbyn without alienating Corbyn’s remaining supporters.Starmer told Marr that significant change was needed. “We just lost four elections in a row and therefore of course we need to change. If we don’t change we will lose the next general election.”He has pledged to work constructively with the government over the response to the pandemic while asking “difficult questions” when needed.Noting that he was taking over Labour in a “completely different world” even from December’s general election due to coronavirus, Starmer pledged to battle for a fairer economic outcome, saying it appeared inevitable that richer people and corporations would need to pay more tax in the coming years.He said it would be unthinkable to respond in the way the government did after the banking crash, with renewed austerity focused disproportionately on poorer people.“What we can’t do is go back to business as usual,” he said. “We now know who the key workers really are, and they very often have been overlooked and underpaid, and there has got to be a change. They were last and now they’ve got to be first.”Starmer declined to say it was inevitable that the government needed to extend the Brexit transition period beyond the end of this year, saying only that ministers should “extend it if it’s necessary to do so”, but he said the hard deadline had been an error.“I’ve always said I think that 12 months is going to be very tight,” he said. “I think the government made a mistake putting dates into legislation. It’s nearly always a mistake to put a date into legislation, because you don’t know what’s going to happen.”As an example of changes he would make in Labour, Starmer singled out his pledges to remove antisemitism from the party, noting that this had been one of the first issues he discussed after being elected.“It’s going to be a long road, it’s going to take a lot of hard work, but I hope I put in at least the first steps yesterday,” he said. Success on the issue would be judged, he added, “by the return of Jewish members to our party”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e8af57f6e9a7e19700783d531a44e1290be9736/349_116_2622_1575/master/2622..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40f3676604587b0d86e0e50b7bbbdc62","title":"loss of grand national 500m hole in racings balance sheet","story":"Any faint hope British racing would follow the lead of its Irish counterpart and attempt to stage its Grand National in the autumn has been swiftly extinguished, leaving an estimated hole of up to £0.5bn in the balance sheet of the sport, betting industries and the local economy, only a fraction of which will be covered by insurance claims.Jockey Club Racecourses, which owns Aintree, has not formally ruled out moving the race but it cancelled – rather than postponed – the 2020 race several weeks ago, shortly before new government restrictions on movement led to the current suspension of all British racing, and there is no expectation the situation will change.Some of JCR’s costs – such as refunding tickets – will be covered by its insurance policy, but revenue generated during the three-day Aintree Festival, from on-course betting, bars, restaurants and so on, will be lost. The total estimated loss for the track, its owners and nearby businesses is expected to reach around £60m.Bookmakers, meanwhile, will be missing out on around £400m in turnover, and their best annual opportunity to attract new customers. The Scottish Grand National, which was due to be staged at Ayr on 18 April, is also one of the most popular betting races of the year.Ireland cancelled the remainder of its 2019-20 jumps season this week, including the Punchestown Festival at the end of this month, but will still aim to reschedule the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse as part of an “enhanced” jumping programme later in the year.The Grand National at Aintree, however, is a much bigger beast than its Irish counterpart by any measure, from its attendance (65,000 versus 12,500) to its traditional build-up over many months.The 1997 Grand National was restaged as a standalone event two days later, in front of around 20,000 spectators, after it was postponed from its traditional Saturday slot following a bomb scare at the course.Even that required immense effort, however, and a two-day delay when much infrastructure was already in place is different to a move to an as yet unspecified date in the autumn when restrictions on large gatherings could still be in place. The National is also the ultimate target for many horses at the outset of the jumps campaign and a shift to the opening weeks of the season could have knock-on effects on top-level National Hunt racing at other tracks for months afterwards.As is the case for so many businesses, lost revenue will not be retrieved when the lockdown ends and it could be months, or even years, before the economy recovers from the effects of the current lockdown. The one cause for optimism, however, as racing counts the cost of losing the entire Grand National meeting for the first time since 1945, is that Tiger Roll, the race winner in 2018 and 2019, is expected to return in 2021 to attempt a third success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50daeaac29ab9ebf11921c921c93532983ebf9e8/0_133_2989_1794/master/2989..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dc476a7fd187806be556f6a50a8e042","title":"my favourite game cubs v indians world series 2016 game 7","story":"The Cubs had gone 108 years without winning the World Series and I was in a bar in Pasadena when they ended the droughtIn 1989 a scriptwriter called Bob Gale needed to sort out a plot twist for Back to the Future Part II, the one where Marty McFly ends up riding a hoverboard in 2015. “What was the most absurd thing you could think of in 1989?” Gale said, many years later. “What would make Marty McFly go: “WHAT???” What would make him want to bet on sports? And it was the Cubs winning the World Series.”At the time it looked the safest of picks. The Cubs were famously inept. Generations of fans at their historic, ivy-clad Wrigley Field had witnessed nothing but failure and underachievement since their last World Series victory in 1908. Even the White Sox, their cross-city rivals, managed a World Series win in 2005 having started the season as 66-1 shots, but the Cubs’ drought moved beyond a century with no sign of any relief.But just a year adrift of Gale’s absurd prediction, in 2016, the Cubs made it through to the World Series for the first time since 1945. They were up against the Cleveland Indians who, in a nice twist, had the second-longest championship drought – a mere 68 seasons, compared to the Cubs’ 108. When the Indians jumped to a 3-1 series lead, including consecutive wins at Wrigley Field in its 100th year, for Cubs fans, all hope once again seemed lost. But two wins of their own levelled it up and forced a Game 7 decider at the Indians’ Progressive Field in Cleveland.And best of all for a UK-based baseball fan, I was in the US when it happened. It was an interesting time to be in the States in any case, with nothing on the news but wall-to-wall election coverage as the presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton went into its final few days. It felt like an escape to step from bright Californian afternoon sunshine into the welcoming darkness of a sports bar in Pasadena as the teams warmed up more than 2,000 miles away to the east.The bar was already packed in anticipation, with Cubs fans outnumbering those rooting for Cleveland by at least 10 to one. And while reality so rarely lives up to expectation, Game 7 was an instant classic, with all the ebb and flow of fortunes and sudden instants of electrifying brilliance and high drama that sets baseball apart.The Cubs got on the board early, as the first batter up hit a long home run over the centre field wall. The Indians tied it in the third, went 3-1 down in the next and 5-1 down by the middle of the fifth. No sooner had Cubs fans started to believe than Cleveland roared back, with two runs to make it 5-3.It was 6-3 Cubs by the middle of the eighth, a three-run cushion with only six outs needed for victory. But baseball is a sport like few others, since a single swing of the bat can score one, two, three or even four runs to turn a game on its head. And with the score back to 6-4 in the bottom of the eighth and a runner on second, Rajai Davis hit a home run which tied the game at 6-6. For only the fifth time in history, Game 7 of the World Series was going to extra innings.And then, it started to rain, delaying the finale for almost half an hour. So it was past midnight in Cleveland when Michael Martínez came to the plate nearly four and a half hours after the first pitch, with two men out, a runner on first and the Cubs 8-7 in front. Still, there was just one swing of the bat in it.A home run would mean a “walk-off” victory for the Indians. One more out would win it all for the Cubs. Martínez hit it into the infield dirt, the throw beat him to first and the extraordinary wave of noise that swept around the bar mingled triumph and astonishment with blessed relief. After 108 years of hurt, it was the sound of sporting absolution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9093708160560c1a3e8507f078d17fa74ecc8ab/0_102_1817_1090/master/1817..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4df474173a556d0656f21660642b597","title":"shane lowry open champion interview golf","story":"Last year’s Open champion reflects on breaking his duck at Royal Portrush, the pressure of being an Irish golfer and what it was like growing up in the shadow of Rory McIlroyShane Lowry has always been blessed with a candour that makes his depiction of trying to cross the line at an Open Championship no surprise. “It’s not a nice place to be,” he says. “It’s where you want to be as a golfer, I hope I’m in that situation again, but anyone telling you to go out and enjoy yourself? They are mad or don’t know what they are talking about. It’s the most unenjoyable weekend of your life. You realise the magnitude of the whole thing.”As uncertainty surrounds the next and 149th playing of the Open, Lowry’s runaway success at Royal Portrush last July is worthy of further reflection. The wave of support and emotion as the man from County Offaly marched down the 72nd fairway emphasised what this meant to Northern Ireland and Irish golf. It was monumental for Lowry too, a maiden major triumph four years after he conceded a four-stroke lead after 54 holes in the US Open at Oakmont.“Oakmont took longer than I realised, my form went really bad after what had been a good 12-18 months. I will probably always look back and think I should have won … but everyone has one of those.”Lowry was to have the last laugh, including on the United States Golf Association executive who thought it smart to draw him as part of a “heavyweight” three ball – Kevin Stadler and Brendon de Jonge the others – at an earlier US Open. “I remember I wasn’t too happy about it at all,” says Lowry. “Whoever came up with that idea, it wasn’t a very nice thing to do.”Lowry can dismiss that incident. When golf resumes, it will be fascinating to see if he can become a multiple major champion. On talent grounds, there is no reason why not. “I’m not happy to live off the Open,” he says. “I’d love to win more. I feel very lucky and privileged to have done what I did, in that manner and where I did it. Genuinely, if it all ended today it would be decent but I’m a very driven and competitive person. I want to keep pushing on.”Lowry’s endearing post-Open celebrations, in Dublin bars and in front of 15,000 people at a homecoming in Clara, became the stuff of legend. “I knew it would be a big deal but when you are living it, it’s incredible,” he recalls. “We are a great country when our sportspeople are doing well. Now, we have no problem kicking sportspeople when they are down as well.“I used to curse the other Irish lads. All that people in Ireland asked me was: ‘When are you going to win a major?’ They don’t think you’ve made it unless you win a major.”Lowry’s smile masks a serious point about not allowing the winning of the Claret Jug to go to his head. “If I was to arrive in my hometown in a flash car, I’d be dragged back down to earth fairly quickly.”In early 2020 Lowry appeared to be toiling with the expectation of being the Open champion, and afforded a bunker some unwanted excavation work when about to miss the cut in Abu Dhabi. Lowry has always set himself high standards had his mindset been adversely affected by Portrush?“Abu Dhabi was very difficult to take,” he says. “I was defending champion in a Rolex Series event and I knew I wasn’t going to play on the European Tour for a while. Before I knew it I had missed the cut and I was taken aback by it. I was hard on myself, I’d be pissed off sitting in the locker room changing my shoes but by the time I’m back at the hotel I’m fine.“The one thing I struggled with is that everywhere I went people expected me to have the burden of being Open champion. In my head I was like: ‘Why is this a burden? This is the greatest thing to happen in my career.’ I’ve not set the world alight since I won but you can get very result-orientated when you do something big. ‘Oh my God, I need to perform to the best of my ability every week.’“I am mature enough to know golf isn’t like that. Golf is a funny game, we are not all Rory McIlroy where we top-five every week. I’ve put pressure on myself for the majority of my career anyway and if anything, I’d put too much on. I don’t feel anything extra now.”Golf’s indefinite shutdown means Lowry may well set a non-wartime record as the reigning Open champion. Yet this break will cause inevitable frustration Lowry has dreams of a Ryder Cup debut at Whistling Straits this year when another of Ireland’s famous sons, Padraig Harrington, will lead Europe’s team. “I’ve never done it so it wouldn’t matter who was captain but it would be extra special with Padraig,” he says. “I want to make the team and think I would be good in that environment. And it’s not just making the team I want to help win the Ryder Cup.”Now 33, Lowry has spent a golfing lifetime in the company of McIlroy. The pair were amateur teammates long before majors were conquered. Lowry scoffs at the notion of one as talented as the world No 1 being a source of jealousy. “I’m open about the fact he is the best player in the world,” he says. “When he has his A-game, I’ve said it for years, there’s nobody better.“He was always the superstar. When you get to hang around and play with the best, you learn a lot. They almost drag you towards – not to – their level. When I was playing amateur golf there were big crowds because Rory was playing. Things like that really helped me.“I’m a very ambitious golfer but I’m not stupid. I know I’m not going to win eight or 10 majors like Rory wants to win. I’m probably never going to be world No 1. But I am going to go out every day and give it the best I can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/709dc165e45b293746eee06bbdf22b51400ae075/0_247_7360_4415/master/7360..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9d293fc60d73f655007d37b56483e8a","title":"crossings review deirdre kinahan drama online","story":"Available onlineDeirdre Kinahan’s touching drama about homosexuality and women’s lives celebrates song, dance and the comfort of theatreCrossings begins in the aftermath of the first world war when two grieving figures meet in a rural backwater. It ends a century later with a contemporary couple whose lives circle back to the same village hall.Margaret is a prickly unmarried woman who has lost everything to the war, including her brother, William. Grace is a charming bohemian who served on the front with William and has sought Margaret out to bury the dead man’s few remaining possessions under a tree, as instructed in the event of his death.The plot initially seems to be about secrets the dead leave behind that posthumously reveal double lives. William was a star of the Immoral Balmorals, a theatre company that entertained troops on the frontlines while fighting alongside them, Grace tells Margaret. What’s more, Grace was in love with him. “Aren’t you’re a man?” asks Margaret accusingly. Grace – wearing a white dress, pearls and a face net – is a man. As Margaret’s guard is lowered, though, she accepts the love between her dead brother and his beguiling lover.Deirdre Kinahan’s play turns out to be an unexpected and touching drama about unlikely friendships, post-war homosexuality and the cost of war for women.It is also fitting that this co-production by Pentabus and New Perspectives revolves around a village hall Pentabus is dedicated to telling rural stories and tours plays about the countryside to fields, theatres and local halls. Crossings is the second work in a three-month long initiative to release one production every week online, free of charge. The first was Matt Hartley’s Here I Belong, also set in a village hall Hattie Naylor’s As the Crow Flies is due to be available from 10 April.The second part of the play turns its focus to the contemporary characters Sean, who is Margaret’s grandson, and Mirjana, a care worker originally from Sarajevo. Their characterisation is flatter and less affecting, and the central parallel made between their lives in 2019 and those of the 1919 couple is strained.But good writing and fine acting make up for such flaws. Victoria Brazier and Will O’Connell, who double up for parts in both time frames, not only show versatility as actors but also have strong singing voices for the musical interludes. There are smooth switches through time in Sophie Motley’s production and minimal props are used to good effect.For all the unresolved grief of war, Crossings is also about the joy of song and dance and, at heart, it celebrates the consolations of theatre and performance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a8e58113151bfc2eab6011e2b0226934101eab/0_195_3162_1898/master/3162..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a7305f7f307d4e23b0ab6c6b1e938e","title":"shakespeares secret co writer finally takes a bow 430 years late","story":"Thomas Watson recognised by literary scholars as the Bard’s forgotten 16th-century collaboratorHe was one of the most celebrated English playwrights of the 16th century, yet none of his plays survived, and today the name of Thomas Watson is virtually unknown. Now the writer, poet and pioneer of the English madrigal – who also saved the life of the playwright Christopher Marlowe in a street brawl – is being seen in a new light.Watson has been identified as the most likely primary author of Arden of Faversham, the first domestic tragedy in English, which was published anonymously in 1592. Many scholars believe that five of the play’s scenes were co-authored with William Shakespeare.Based on a notorious murder of 1551, Arden is about a woman from Faversham, Kent, who conspires with her lover to kill her husband and struggles to “wash away this blood”, just like Lady Macbeth.Over five years of research, Professor Gary Taylor, a leading Shakespeare scholar, has found stylistic, biographical and historical links to Watson in almost every scene. He concludes that there is “strong and consistent evidence” for his authorship.Watson was a polymath whose talents extended from writing poetry in Latin to creating the first published set of English madrigals. In 1595, Shakespeare was described as “Watson’s heire” by William Clerke, in a work titled Polimanteia, but only recently have scholars even realised that Watson was a playwright.“Almost everything Watson did was original,” said Taylor, professor of literature at Florida State University and general editor of The New Oxford Shakespeare. “Even specialists only know one tiny aspect of his work, instead of putting it all together.”Taylor’s new research will be published in The Review of English Studies later this year. He is also among leading contributors to Early Shakespeare, 1588-1594,  a major reappraisal of Shakespeare’s early career, to be published this month by Cambridge University Press. This will contain essays on Arden by other scholars.Dr Rory Loughnane, its co-editor and a senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: “Taylor’s identification of Watson’s hand in Arden … is a major finding, not least for our understanding of Shakespeare’s early career. Though obscure now, Watson was a polymath and, like his close friend Marlowe, a celebrated poet, translator and dramatist. Watson was also extremely well-connected within London’s literary scene that he collaborated with Shakespeare, who was then in his mid-20s, reveals the sorts of influential circles the ambitious Stratford man moved in at the very beginning of his career.”Taylor said: “We’re looking for a writer who is capable of writing a great play. Watson was greatly admired at the time, celebrated for tragic plays before Marlowe or Shakespeare became famous.”Arden authorship contenders have included Thomas Kyd, who wrote The Spanish Tragedy. Taylor said: “Watson looks more likely than any other writer of the 1580s or early 1590s. As a native Londoner with legal training, born in the 1550s and praised by his contemporaries as an early master of tragedy in the commercial theatres, Watson shares the biographical profile that first led critics to suspect Kyd’s hand in the play.”He added: “A lot of the material is funny, and Watson … was also famously funny. In 1596, one writer remembered ‘the froth of witty Tom Watson’s jests’.”Among other biographical evidence, Taylor draws parallels between Arden and Watson’s defence of Marlowe when he was attacked in the street in 1589: “The husband who would be famously murdered is defended by a friend in an earlier attack.

It is nonsense – the worst kind of fake news.“The reality is that the mobile phone networks are absolutely critical to all of us, particularly in a time when we are asking people to stay at home and not see relatives and friends.“But, in particular, those are also the phone networks used by our emergency services and our health workers and I am absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency.“It is absolute, utter rubbish and I can’t condemn it in terms stronger than that.”Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, is to hold talks with platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Twitter “to hammer this message home”, the source said.Celebrities including the singer Anne-Marie, have helped spread the theory on social media. Amanda Holden, a judge on Britain’s Got Talent, shared a link to an online petition claiming the symptoms of Covid-19 were caused by residing near a 5G mast.

From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/353a242eb736dab1df645bb2837a4b6ba7f0dd2b/0_410_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81f4e54fe523fa7891843b3184397bf","title":"lockdown learning how to dance tango classes online youtube","story":"Our writer tries to recreate the buzz of a Buenos Aires dancehall in his UK living room with a selection of tango classes on YouTube All of Argentina’s 44 million inhabitants currently appear to be offering online tango classes. OK, that’s an exaggeration, but it’s fair to say that porteños (residents of Buenos Aires) are jumping into the world of virtual tango with both high-heeled feet.Available classes range from Dance Tango TV, with starter courses from $19 a month, to iDance.net’s lesson packs, with a two-hour class from just $1.69.Google “free tango classes” or, in Spanish, “clases de tango online gratis” and you’ll find several YouTube tutors. Welcome Argentina has very watchable sessions in Spanish.My partner, Kate, and I took a refresher lesson. Jonatan and Julia speak pretty good English and their opening 10-minute class concentrated on posture. I hope they add more classes this week. James and Joanna are apparently in England, but who cares? They are very good on the first few key moves. Sebastián and Mariana are the real thing, and can show the more confident a few tricks.Most online classes are delivered by couples, though a few dancers do work alone, if you want to indulge the fantasy of a long-distance tango partner. Songs typically last three minutes – though one dancer titled her book Twelve Minutes of Love to reflect the fact that tangueros generally do tandas (turns) of four songs – so expect three minutes of giggling as your lower limbs get tied in knots and your high kick hits the telly.Once you have a few basic moves and feel a sense of tango rhythm, tune in to La 2 x 4 , a 24-hour online tango radio station funded by Buenos Aires city hall. When I tuned in they were playing crooner numbers driven by pounding button accordion.Your living room may not have the atmosphere of an Argentine milonga, but uncork a decent malbec, dim the lights, put on something by Julio de Caro or Juan Carlos Cobián and you’ll be transported far away from the world of Covid-19 for three minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3b78f8faecfa509c17c1f61ab0464d39bdb49a/0_239_5030_3020/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b7aecb09fb1e4af3ee91a1ef68d5c6","title":"send tip favourite travel souvenir win 200 pounds sawdays stay","story":"Tell us about something you picked up on your travels that brings back great memories or takes you back in timeGiven that we’re all stuck at home for who knows how long, our travel memories are especially poignant.

But with the race for the nomination effectively in a state of suspended animation amid the coronavirus pandemic, the 78-year-old Vermont senator has resisted.Covid-19 has ravaged the US economy and strained the healthcare system, claiming more than 7,000 lives and nearly 10 million jobs. The twin economic and public health crises give what Sanders and allies have described as a new imperative to his calls for universal healthcare and a wide expansion of the social safety net.“In many ways, this pandemic has made the case for a lot of the policies that the senator has spent 35 years fighting for,” said Anna Bahr, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign. “Reality has endorsed Bernie Sanders.”Since stepping off the physical campaign trail, Sanders has turned his focus almost entirely to the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis he said is on the “scale of a major war”. In glitchy media interviews from his home in Vermont, the senator has argued that the US would be better prepared – and more resilient – in the face of a future pandemic if his policy agenda were already in place.But his continued presence in the race has alarmed many Democrats, haunted by the fallout from a isive primary four years ago they believe contributed to Hillary Clinton’s defeat by Donald Trump. Sanders, they contend, had a year to make the case for his political revolution and should now bow out and help unify the party.“It’s a fantasy to say there is some path for Bernie Sanders to win this nomination,” Jay Jacobs, chairman of the New York party. “If he stays in this race, Bernie Sanders is doing it for one reason and one reason alone and unfortunately it’s for Bernie Sanders.”On the one hand, he has acknowledged Biden’s daunting lead. Yet he insists there is a path to the nomination, albeit a “narrow” one.After a dismal showing last month, the campaign deactivated its digital ads while pausing spending on TV ads. Days later, the campaign announced it was ramping up digital organizing ahead of the New York primary, the most delegate-rich contest left New York has since postponed from 28 April to 23 June.Sanders recently said he would welcome a debate in April, an idea Biden dismissed.“We’ve had enough debates,” the former vice-president said.Sanders’ allies are split. Some have said it’s time to exit while others believe he should continue to compete. On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that a group of top aides, including his campaign manager, had encouraged Sanders to withdraw. But many supporters believe the senator should continue collecting delegates, which will serve as leverage to shape the party platform at the national convention. “Campaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,” Sanders said on NBC’s Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday. “So that’s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.”Biden has largely avoided pressuring Sanders, well aware he will need support in the fall if he is the nominee. But he’s not waiting for Sanders either. In recent weeks, Biden has begun making overtures to progressives and young voters. In a fundraising call on Friday night, Biden revealed that he had spoken to Sanders about his search for a running mate.“He’s a friend,” Biden said. “I don’t want him to think I’m being presumptuous but you have to start now deciding who you’re going to have background checks done on as potential vice-presidential candidates and it takes time.”Like Biden, Sanders has been sharply critical of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But they erge on how they would harness the federal government to respond to a future pandemic.“Our healthcare is without equal in the developed world in being dysfunctional and unfair and expensive,” said Wendell Potter, former head of communications at Cigna who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. “And I think this experience is going to bring into sharp focus how bad we are in terms of providing healthcare.”Sanders’ advocacy has not moved his rival. Biden was recently pressed on MSNBC to explain why universal healthcare isn’t a better option as millions of Americans stand to lose coverage in the coming months, a shift in the way questions about the sweeping proposal are typically framed.“Single-payer will not solve that at all,” Biden replied. He said overhauling the US healthcare system would take too long and advocated instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act.In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has stopped actively fundraising and instead leveraged its extensive donor list to raise money for charities helping Americans suffering from the outbreak. His team has surveyed supporters for ideas on how Congress can provide economic relief, circulated petitions demanding protective equipment and safety protections for Amazon and Walmart workers, and even adapted its digital organizing app, Bern, to help connect users with resources and aid.Sanders frequently hosts roundtable discussions. On one occasion he sought to channel a wartime president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hosting a fireside chat.The campaign says it raised more than $4.5m for the charities and more than 14 million people have viewed its livestreams.Sander has also used his perch in the Senate to influence the debate over the response to the crisis. When three Republican senators objected to a provision in the $2tn rescue package that expanded unemployment insurance, Sanders threatened to block the bill unless they dropped their opposition.“Oh my God, the universe is collapsing!” he said, mocking their concern that the bill might give some struggling Americans extra financial support in a time of crisis. “Oh my word, will the universe survive?”The recovery package, the largest ever in American history, passed unanimously.On Friday, Sanders released a slate of priorities for the next stimulus package that his campaign touted as “the boldest legislation ever written in modern history”.They include monthly cash payments of $2,000 monthly to all iniduals, including undocumented immigrants, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments, hazard pay for essential workers and using Medicare to pay all medical costs incurred during the pandemic.The plan is almost certainly a nonstarter in a Republican-controlled Senate wary of expanding federal relief beyond what was included in the last package.It remains unlikely that Sanders can dramatically reshape the Democratic primary. He is almost hopelessly behind Biden in the delegate count and many of the biggest contests left are in states that appear more favorable to the former VP, like Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.The next test comes on Tuesday, when Wisconsin is scheduled to hold its primary despite calls from Sanders and several legal challenges to postpone it. Sanders will likely need a strong performance in the state to keep alive the already dim prospect of a comeback. A new poll from Marquette Law School found Sanders trailing Biden by nearly 30 points in the battleground state.Sanders knows he has a decision to make. He is, as he tells every interviewer, “assessing” his options. Fundamentally, he believes the pandemic has changed the calculus.Is it possible to fall short of his presidential ambitions but succeed in his decades-long battle to remake US society?“Right now in this unprecedented moment in American history,” Sanders told The View, “I think we need to have a very serious look at how we need to go forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4322830d9c43ce13da94c74527b3f1404c0150be/0_0_5934_3564/master/5934..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62321be2c1c7429fc05ac0e55bb317df","title":"search kennedy relatives chesapeake bay canoe","story":"Divers and boats will on Sunday resume their search in the Chesapeake Bay for the bodies of the daughter and a grandson of former Maryland lieutenant governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Maryland police said.The search began on Thursday afternoon after a report of a canoe in the bay that did not return to shore and appeared to be overtaken by strong winds. The search was suspended on Saturday night, a Maryland natural resources police news release said.The missing canoeists were identified as Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean, 40, and McKean’s eight-year-old son, Gideon Joseph Kennedy McKean.“With profound sadness, I share the news that the search for my beloved daughter Maeve and grandson Gideon has turned from rescue to recovery,” Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement on Friday night.Kennedy Townsend, who served two terms as Maryland’s lieutenant governor, is the eldest daughter of the US attorney general and New York senator Robert F Kennedy, who was shot dead in 1968, and niece of John F Kennedy, the 35th president who was assassinated in 1963.On Saturday, vessels conducted sonar operations around the area where the two were last seen and where their overturned canoe was recovered, according to police. The mother and son may have been paddling the canoe from a home in Shady Side, Maryland, to retrieve a ball and could not paddle back to shore, police said earlier.Maeve McKean, a public health and human rights lawyer, was executive director of the Georgetown University Global Health Initiative. She graduated from Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service and law school.“Maeve was a master connector who brought together faculty and students across disciplines and schools in order to advance our shared mission for improving health and advancing justice, particularly for those left out or left behind,” John Monahan, an adviser to Georgetown’s president, said in a news release.Monahan said the university community was “heartsick” about what happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ec6d5c9d5dd1ff3200778e03a8895db20dc28bc/0_349_5084_3051/master/5084..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=987adb9762c4cdea3a7cc6dd63d626a8","title":"recruit volunteer army to trace coronavirus contacts now urge top scientists","story":"Ministers must take steps to track down possible infections, says new grouping of health experts Ministers must recruit an army of “contact tracing” volunteers to warn people who mayhave been infected by a Covid-19 sufferer, say public health experts.More than 50 leading scientists say health secretary Matt Hancock’s plans to introduce 100,000 tests a day by the end of April will only solve part of the problem of establishing how far the virus has spread.The scientists have come together to form the UK Covid-19 Group of Experts, and say contact tracing – identifying then alerting people who have been within infection range of a person confirmed to have the virus – will be a vital addition to testing when the lockdown begins to ease.Professor Allyson Pollock, a consultant in public health and director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science, said: “The government needs to recognise that this isn’t just one big epidemic. It’s lots of outbreaks at different stages that all need to be tackled locally through local teams, and local action plans in each area so measures can be lifted over time.”Public Health England was contact tracing cases until 12 March, at which point 32 people had died after contracting coronavirus. Schools stayed open for another eight days and it was 11 days before Boris Johnson announced the lockdown, on 23 March.In the face of growing criticism over the lack of testing for frontline health professionals and those with mild symptoms, Hancock announced a “five-pillar” plan last Thursday. He pledged to increase lab testing dramatically, introduce new antibody tests for people who may have had the virus, and conduct “surveillance testing” – checking samples of the population to model the extent of the virus’s spread.“We’ve lost nearly two months in getting on top of this epidemic,” Pollock said. “And that’s what the scandal is really.” She said there would be a second wave of infections, and planning needed to start now.“Clearly we don’t have the capacity to do contact tracing, but we can just call for volunteers, train them up to do it and combine that with mobile phone apps as in Singapore and South Korea and China.”Some UK public health professionals, however, believe it is too late for contact tracing because the virus has spread too far. And the example set by Singapore appears increasingly questionable: the country is to close most workplaces and all schools this week following the prime minister’s admission that “despite our good contact tracing” the authorities have been unable to ascertain the origin of nearly half its new cases.One senior director of public health, responsible for local health teams including contact tracing, dismissed the experts group as “armchair commentators”. “Contact tracing would be a waste of time right now,” said the director, who asked not to be named. “We should have done better on testing, but that’s being resolved. Contact tracing would tell you nothing because it’s so widespread. We have to focus on increasing testing, and most virologists I’ve spoken to would agree.“I suspect there will come a time for contract tracing again, but not now. It’s when you start getting outbreaks in care homes and prisons and hospitals, or possibly when we’re through the first or second peak and the numbers are bumping along the bottom.”Yet the calls for contact tracing to resume appear to be gathering steam. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has repeatedly called for testing and contact tracing.At the beginnng of last week, Pollock and three others published a paper in the British Medical Journal questioning why the government was not following WHO advice. Then last Wednesday, 24 public health experts, led by David McCoy, professor of global public health at Barts Medical School, signed an open letter urging the government “to expand community testing and inidual case detection, contact tracing and appropriate isolation as a core disease control measure”.“Testing and quarantine are not enough on their own,” McCoy said, “especially if we want to avoid some of the serious harms that would be caused by prolonged lockdown. It is not clear why the government is resisting the evidence from elsewhere, as well as the views of the majority of public health opinion.”The group has since expanded to include more than 50 public health experts, Pollock said.AnneliesWilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “To anyone who tells me that contact tracing is too expensive or not do-able, I just say, rubbish. We are now basically quarantining 68 million people. That is so much more expensive. But at the moment, we cannot do contract tracing.”She said with the epidemic “out of hand”, the lockdown needs time to interrupt the virus’s transmission.“Then we can go back to the basics of dealing with this outbreak. You test, test, test, test. You find a case, you isolate the case you find their contacts and you isolate their contacts.”The Department for Health and Social Care did not respond to requests for comment, but some academics believe smartphone apps might provide automatic contact tracing.NHSX, a ision of the NHS responsible for digital innovation, is working on an app that would monitor other phones’ Bluetooth signals, keeping a record of those most at risk – possibly anyone who stayed within two metres for 15 minutes, the FT reported. If a user tested positive, they could upload a notification, which would warn people they needed to self-isolate.Yet the tracking technology would raise privacy concerns, and the system would not work efficiently unless tens of millions of people downloaded the app.“Mobile technology may be a useful adjunct, but contact tracing and the behaviour change we subsequently want to engender needs an active human element,” McCoy said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8de8c272a9be04a319822ab10592c12352b2320/0_142_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f341dca31f6df90e334f1a6de54fd98b","title":"sunak emergency covid 19 loan what do companies think","story":"The chancellor’s original scheme worried employers. So how has the revamped plan gone down?Newmarket HolidaysMarc Vincent, finance director of Newmarket Holidays, says the firm sells 80,000 holidays a year and around a third are sold online. Now he is deluged by customer inquiries. That has meant he cannot furlough staff: it’s all hands to the pumps.“If tour operators are allowed to go under, it will be like a run on a bank, with a long chain of suppliers also affected,” he said. “And then the government will need to bail out customers anyway, so much better to do it now.”To benefit from a VAT holiday until the summer, staff have spent the last week delving through payments, though he says the savings are limited.Regulations that give customers the right to demand their money back on package holidays within 14 days of cancellation should be changed, he says. Instead, travel firms should be allowed to offer credit notes that can be redeemed after two years if they are not spent. “Other EU countries are doing this and so should we.”Chairman and chief executive Antony Sheriff was disappointed with Sunak’s first effort at a loan scheme for medium-sized companies like his when it insisted they must access commercial loans – a costly and cumbersome procedure. The reforms mean the company will now examine them favourably. “I think he has done a good job,” says Sheriff.The 55-year-old company has cash in the bank and could withstand several months of a lockdown, he says, but he is concerned about the costs of starting up again in the summer or autumn, which could mean outlays for materials would be prohibitively expensive.“We make everything on our boats, from the hull to the furniture. It all happens here. We account for about 15,000 jobs in the Plymouth area and the ease of getting back into production is key,” he says.Any thought of profits this year have evaporated. “Everybody will look back at 2020 and say what a shame, but I hope not too many people will focus on the financials in a year that is pretty much a write-off,” he says. Newcastle UniversityThere are officials inside the Treasury who consider universities the linchpin and economic driving force of many towns and cities in Britain. Huge employers, they are also tied into the local economy through relationships with businesses and state agencies, including the NHS.Some staff on fixed-term contracts have had their status paused, he says, while the university looks to place them in other roles. But his main concern is bridging the likely two-to-three-year gap before foreign student numbers return to current levels. “We don’t have the resources to keep research going with financial help from our funders. We don’t get the full economic cost of research paid for other than by cross-subsidy from foreign student income. It has always been an unstable situation that the pandemic forces us to address,” he says. Fred Olsen“I have been talking to our management team about government funding and how the travel industry has reacted passively while airline businesses like Virgin Atlantic have said a subsidy is desperately needed,” says Peter Deer, managing director of Fred Olsen Cruise Lines.Virgin has called on the government to give the industry up to £7.5bn in state support. The chancellor rebuffed the call, saying he would only consider support on a case-by-case basis. Despite this setback, Deer thinks the travel industry should be making more noise.The company, which has a turnover of £200m-£250m, has four ships laying up in the Firth of Forth and a fifth, the Braemar, about to leave Southampton to join them. About 300 of the firm’s 500 staff in Ipswich are home-working while they deal with customer inquiries, many of them about lost bookings. The rest are at home not working.“We are using the furlough scheme, and that is great, but there are many other costs we face,” he says, adding that the government should be working harder to prevent the industry shrinking.“The drop in cruise-ship business has come as a huge shock to our suppliers, the majority of which are in the UK. There are 40,000 people in the industry and they are being completely overlooked.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdb1bee12f06216f2cee1800ad45fd47effbf02c/0_139_4416_2649/master/4416..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5bf2b53e12686f202e6d2cf9ed11821","title":"coronavirus churches florida social distancing","story":"Concerted effort to protect religious freedoms is playing out as some states exempt houses of worship from stay-home ordersWhen a Florida pastor, who had been arrested for holding a church service despite local coronavirus restrictions, complained he was the victim of “a tyrannical government”, Ron DeSantis, the state’s Republican governor, was listening.In executive orders issued in quick succession this week, DeSantis designated religious services as “essential activities”. Then he swept away the right of cities and counties to ban them.“I don’t think the government has the authority to close a church. I’m certainly not going to do that,” DeSantis said. “In Easter season, people are going to want to have access to religious services.”This, however, was no municipality-versus-state power struggle. A concerted effort to protect religious freedoms is playing out across the country in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, frustrating efforts by public health officials to enforce social distancing per federal guidelines and slow the spread of the deadly virus.In almost all of the states that lead the nation in numbers of cases, and which have issued blanket stay-at-home orders, there are specific exemptions for religious gatherings or acts of worship, a survey by the  of published regulations and media coverage found.In others with definitive lists of non-essential businesses or activities ordered to close, churches, synagogues, mosques, temples and other houses of faith are not among them.What isn’t clear is how many people are still attending services, or how many are taking place. Leaders of many of the largest religions by followers in the US, including Mormonism, Catholicism, Islam and various denominations of Judaism, have closed houses of worship and are urging services take place online.“This decision comes out of sacrificial love, not from habitual or casual disregard for worship,” the leaders of Christianity Today and the National Association of Evangelicals said in a joint statement.“We will not be passing the peace with hugs, but rather with texts and phone calls. Are these modes inferior? Yes. Will they be acceptable to the Lord? We also believe, yes.”An open letter to Catholic bishops calling for public mass and access to the holy sacraments is gaining traction online, pushed by a newly-formed group of theologians and ministers calling itself the Easter People.“Something is terribly wrong with a culture that allows abortion clinics and liquor stores to remain open but shuts down places of worship,” the group said.Other than Texas and Florida, states that have issued exemptions for religious events and with large numbers of coronavirus cases or significant populations of older people include Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Tennessee and West Virginia. The homepage for executive orders signed by the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, includes the words: “A place of religious worship is not subject to penalty.”The Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy research group, published its own study of states it found to have enacted exemptions to stay-at-home orders on religious grounds, describing it as “an alarming trend”.According to the group, Pennsylvania was the first to move, on 19 March when it enacted a clause that exempts the “operations of religious institutions” from its closure order on physical premises of “non-life sustaining businesses”.Over the next five days, five more states – New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Louisiana, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, West Virginia and Kansas – acted by including religious exemptions to varying degrees. For example, New Mexico banned gatherings of more than five people anywhere, with “churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship” among the exceptions. West Virginia’s order, meanwhile, adds specific wording to assure citizens that travel to and from a place of worship would also not be considered a violation.The fact that religious groups can still hold gatherings in so many states does not mean all of them will do so. But there are prominent exceptions, such as the Florida pastor Rodney Howard-Browne, who has now decided to shutter his River at Tampa Bay church for this weekend’s Palm Sunday services anyway, and the Life Tabernacle church in Louisiana. Dozens of cases of coronavirus have been reported at a California megachurch.“The ability to gather as people of faith is our first freedom. But as with other freedoms now cabined in the name of public safety, religious freedom must take a backseat, at least for now,” is the view of an editorial by three Canopy analysts, Robin Fretwell Wilson, Brian Smith and Tanner Bean.“Now is not the time to stand on our rights. It is not the time to pursue contentious religious freedom claims in the courthouse. Instead, it is a time to lead by example, as so many congregations and people of faith have done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of confirmed cases globally has passed 1.2m, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Just over one in four of these are in the US, which has 311,544 cases. There have been 64,753 coronavirus-related deaths worldwide. The five countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases were the US, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. China, which is now at number six, reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, up from 19 a day earlier as the number of cases involving travellers from abroad as well as local transmissions increased.Donald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus. The president also warned the US that the worst was yet to come, and that Americans would see “a lot of death”. At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president sought to discredit media reports of his administration’s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps “fake news”. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success.Authorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst-affected by coronavirus, have enacted a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside. In the absence of a mask, people should “cover their mouths and noses with a simple foulard or scarf”, said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. The law came as images from major cities including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days amid good weather.The European Union’s very survival is at stake and a new “Marshall plan for Europe is needed” to rebuild the continent’s economies, Spain’s prime minister has warned in article published by the . Europe must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery, Pedro Sánchez said. A critical juncture had been reached at which even the most fervently pro-European countries and governments, as is Spain’s case, needed real proof of commitment in the form of “unwavering solidarity”.South Sudan, one of the world’s poorest states where decades of war and hunger have already devastated infrastructure, has become one of the latest states to record a confirmed case of Covid-19. The case was a 29-year-old woman who arrived in February from the Netherlands, via Ethiopia. Elsewhere, Iran said Covid-19 infections stood at 58,226 while the death toll from the outbreak was 3,603.Outdoor exercise could be banned in Britain if people flout the social distancing rules, the UK’s health minister has warned. Matt Hancock said sunbathing in public spaces was against the government guidance, and told those who dared to disobey that they were putting their own and others’ lives at risk. His warning came ahead of a televised address by the Queen, who was expected to praise Britain for its “self-discipline” and “resolve” during the coronavirus pandemic.Health authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that the country may be able to limit its domestic outbreak, as the nation’s death toll reached 34. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early, saying that could lead to a resurgence in cases. The government has also warned its citizens that imported “home” Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the kits were not reliable and could lead to people failing to isolate themselves or seek the medical help they need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

The number is expected to increase to “hundreds of thousands being delivered every week” according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, but action has been much quicker on the ground. We speak to some of the heroes in the drive to keep the nation fed.SloughIn a little under three weeks, Ajmal Azam has helped support about 300 people in his local community by organising a network of food parcels, shopping and hot meals for those most in need. In another life, 36-year-old Azam is a full-time barrister practising in family law, a married father of two and a school governor. Now he spends six hours a day packing and delivering boxes of tinned goods, pulses, bread, fruit and veg. It’s humbling, he admits, but crucial work.Azam drew up a roster of volunteers, and has been working alongside Sikhs in Slough, who are also operating a mobile food-support network for those who are over 65 and quarantined. “We called up Wexham, our local hospital, to ask what they needed, and a senior A\u0026ampE sister pointed out that a number of nurses are in self-isolation and struggling to get basic necessities – so we put together 100 packages that day.”While Azam has spent “probably more than £1,000” getting supplies together, he is keen to credit local grocers, supermarkets and takeaways that have been providing food and essentials. “Everyone wants to help. That’s incredible. My phone hasn’t stopped ringing since we put the first flyer out on social media. I do feel drained and exhausted at this stage but the impact we’ve had is so endearing. I’ve had so many messages from people that it’s making a difference to. That’s keeping me going.”LondonChef Michey Chan is used to cooking up a storm. In his day job, heading up the staff kitchen at the Dorchester, he prepares an average of 900 meals for the lunch and dinner service. At Manorfield primary school in east London, where he is now feeding the children of key workers and teaching staff, the brief is a touch less intense but arguably a lot more satisfying.“The kids have really good palates,” says Chan. “They don’t have bad eating habits and they’re adventurous about trying a lot of things. Sometimes we have to bribe them with cookies but they try everything.”It has been two weeks since the Dorchester team took up residency in the school canteen, in an area that headteacher Paul Jackson describes as “incredibly deprived”. Over half the school is entitled to free school meals, and 72 pupils are on the child protection register. At the moment, anywhere between 12 and 20 children are coming in every day, with Manorfield operating as a hub for neighbouring schools.With help from the Dorchester and the local authority, Jackson is now working on a scheme to get hot meals and food parcels delivered to vulnerable local families throughout the Easter holidays: “It’s a way for us to feel useful – you don’t notice the stress of everything until you’re out of here. One thing is certain: even when things change, school meals here will never be the same again. The standards have been changed for ever.”GlasgowIt began, as lockdown ideas now often do, over Whatsapp. Disheartened by the gloom shrouding Glasgow, jewellery maker Freya Alder got chatting to her friends – illustrator Isabella Burnell and textile designer Ruth Mitchell – about ways to lift the collective mood. The three launched the Maker’s Raffle two weeks ago with pieces donated by a dozen Scottish ceramicists, potters, textile designers and printmakers, hoping to match the £1,500 Alder had raised in December for Glasgow South East Foodbank.“After the general election, I felt a huge sense of doom and powerlessness. Going to the Co-op the morning after and putting some stuff in the food bank made me feel infinitely better, which is where the idea was born,” says Alder. The response this time round, however, has floored her.“I did a little callout but people have been amazing. Our businesses are small and they’ve been hit hard but we know other vulnerable people are struggling.”Despite a significant loss of income for many of the one-person businesses trying to weather the current crisis, Alder reports that “it’s made us all feel better, I think that’s why it’s been so successful. Makers are uncomfortable trying to sell their wares when they know people are stretched thin, but this is a tiny little gesture anyone can join in.”Tickets are £2. Alder’s hope is that communities in other cities will copy the model to support food banks, which are desperate for donations nationwide. “Every city has a creative scene, and if every city did one of these it could make so much money for people who need it most,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb2a1b547434fd26f2d60d636d1e2272e6fb42d6/0_61_1800_1080/master/1800..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebfd7fe8930f1a19532720569d2b4da6","title":"germanys devolved logic is helping it win the coronavirus race","story":"With 400 public health offices forging ahead with testing, the country is a model for others to emulateAs the coronavirus crisis tests the resilience of democracies around the globe, Germany has gone from cursing its lead-footed, decentralised political system to wondering if federalism’s tortoise versus hare logic puts it in a better position to brave the pandemic than most.Under German federalism – which has roots going back to the Holy Roman Empire but was entrenched after the Nazi era to weaken centralised rule – key policy areas, such as health, education and cultural affairs, fall under the jurisdiction of the country’s 16 states, or Länder.At the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, such a highly devolved system of governance made the woman nominally in charge of the country look oddly powerless: even when Angela Merkel announced the first raft of social-distancing measures, she could only make recommendations that the federal states were free to implement or ignore.As social-distancing measures came into effect, there were howls of frustration over how wildly the lockdowns varied between the states: in Berlin, for example, buying a book from a shop is still allowed but having a picnic in the park is not. In Baden-Württemberg, it’s the other way around.Federalism is useful for creating a dynamic business environment between different regions, but it can make it hard for an entire country to move in sync.States in the formerly socialist east, less severely hit by the virus, were reluctant to close their schools, drawing ire from southern states who feared their students would then be put at a disadvantage.A week and a half into the de facto lockdown, however, Germany is beginning to discover the upsides of a system which distributes, rather than centralises, power.The country suddenly finds itself being held up as the model to be emulated for its high rates of testing – seen by many as the only strategy for being able to navigate a route out of lockdown measures.German public health services are provided not by one central authority but by approximately 400 public health offices, run by municipality and rural district administrations.Such an environment allows for a variety of laboratories – some attached to universities or hospitals, others privately run, medium-sized businesses – which act largely autonomously of central control.“I don’t have to wait to get a call from the health minister before I can go ahead with a test,” said Matthias Orth, of the Institute of Laboratory Medicine at Stuttgart’s Marienhospital.Some private labs started offering tests for the Covid-19 virus long before statutory health insurers were offering to pay for the tests, giving Germany a head start. Now around 250 laboratories are carrying out between 300,000 and 500,000 tests for Covid-19 every week.Not bad for a lead-footed tortoise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5054e260393fd42808acb4d46377bc3d8da204b/81_116_3419_2053/master/3419..jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=cd653f74b472fe5e7a75174d54daa213","title":"scottish fruit farmers recruit thousands locals save harvest","story":"Students and laid-off bar and restaurant workers given jobs as pickers after urgent appeal Scottish fruit farmers have solved a recruitment crisis which could have resulted in this year’s harvest of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries being destroyed.Several thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off due the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania.Farmers across the UK have warned that fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by the Europe-wide coronavirus lockdown, which has prevented tens of thousands of workers flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season.Recruitment agencies have proposed chartering special flights to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from the region’s fruit farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies.James Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, a farmers organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal have filled all their vacancies. “We’ve had a big response,” he said. “It’s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.” Many were students whose university courses had stopped, who normally had summer jobs.Picking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, although picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had begun. Picking would accelerate in May and peak from June onwards.He said fruit picking was a skilled and demanding job it required speed, dexterity and knowledge about which fruit to pick. Migrant workers had been doing this work for 10 to 15 years, he said, and were extremely fast.New recruits also needed to learn how to work safely with machinery and equipment, and maintain social distancing while picking to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus.New recruits took time and training to develop the skills his normal workforce had, and it was unclear whether the people who had signed up for this season’s harvest would turn up or stay on if they found the job too demanding.Local recruits may also leave if their old jobs return and universities resume teaching once the lockdown is relaxed, he added. “A lot of things have to line up and work this summer. We really are in uncharted territory.”Similar problems confronted asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprout farmers this summer, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eb7eb68d516b06426105d4e10e839c4297ae0f0/0_0_4488_2693/master/4488..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b4ef953a8ba714eb5f62d9a7b820bb2","title":"uk government commits pilot no interest loan scheme coronavirus","story":"Campaigners say scheme should be accelerated in face of coronavirus crisisThe government has committed to piloting no-interest loans for people on low incomes, but is resisting calls for the support to be accelerated in order to tackle the coronavirus recession.The coronavirus crisis has prompted concerns that people on low incomes could fall through the gaps in the government’s support, causing them to look to payday lenders and other providers of high-cost credit to pay for essential goods during the lockdown, when they are unable to look for work.A Treasury-commissioned report found that a no-interest loan scheme (NILS) would be feasible, with money either loaned by a central government body or by using existing lenders, with a potentially quicker rollout. Funding could come from government, levies on the banking or gambling sectors, or the National Lottery, the report said.Such a scheme would mainly target lower-income people who cannot afford to repay interest on loans of between £200 and £2,000, although they would still have to be able to repay the amount borrowed. The study found that more than 400,000 people in Britain would be eligible.The report was published last month by its authors, the consultancy London Economics, but has not been published on the government’s website despite being completed last year. A Treasury spokesman said the government would pilot the scheme, but declined to give a timetable for the pilot or to say if it was considered by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, as a coronavirus relief measure.In the past fortnight almost a million people have applied for universal credit, the main form of income support, despite large incentives for businesses to retain workers.“If there was ever a time to recognise the need to reform access to credit it is now,” said the Labour MP Stella Creasy,who has campaigned against high-cost credit. “That the Treasury has evidence on how to do this makes the case even more compelling for action as it shows it’s possible even when there isn’t a financial crisis looming.”Peter Tutton, the head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, said no-interest loans should be expedited, alongside the more flexible application of universal credit and help for community lenders and credit unions.“With nearly 10 million people already under financial pressure before the current crisis, it’s vital to find better alternatives to high-cost credit that can spiral people into worse debt,” he said.The Treasury-commissioned study was an initiative kicked off by the former chancellor Philip Hammond in the 2018 budget in an attempt to stop payday lenders ripping off poorer customers.A Treasury spokesman said: “The chancellor has announced an unprecedented package of support for workers and businesses.”The spokesman pointed to policies increasing universal credit and tax credit payments by £7bn and said the government was “helping the most vulnerable with their council tax bills through a £500m hardship fund”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3658ecc5940f5978ccc027d1c1469745530a8cca/92_307_2840_1704/master/2840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24e405a64a511500bb6a2b5f995456d6","title":"what happens lungs coronavirus covid 19","story":"Respiratory physician John Wilson explains the range of Covid-19 impacts, from no symptoms to severe illness featuring pneumoniaWhat became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

The total number of confirmed deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus in hospitals in England has risen to 4,494, NHS England has said, an increase of 555.The patients were aged between 33 years and 103 years old and 29 of them were aged between 35 and 95 years old and had no known underlying health conditions, according to NHS England.The patients were from the following regions:The daily update on UK coronavirus cases will be released later on Sunday, the Department of Health said. The number of people who have died in Northern Ireland after contracting coronavirus has risen by seven to 63, health officials have said. Tests have confirmed a further 91 positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the region to 1,089, though the true total is almost certainly much higher.We should have statistics for the rest of the UK shortly.The Observer’s Nosheen Iqbal has been speaking with the volunteers delivering food to people’s homes.Keir Starmer has received a briefing from senior government officials on the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman for the new Labour leader said: This afternoon Keir Starmer was briefed over the phone by senior government officials about the coronavirus pandemic. During the call, the Labour leader reiterated his commitment to work constructively with the government in the national interest.Cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance were on the call.A investment management firm founded by Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, has been accused of profiteering from the coronavirus crisis.First reported by the Sunday Mirror, the business’ fund manager Mark Asquith said in a piece of promotional material for investors: History has shown us that super normal returns can be made during this type of environment. Market dislocations of this magnitude happen rarely, perhaps once or twice in a generation, and have historically provided excellent entry points for investors.Strategies such as those believed to have been employed by SCM are not uncommon but new Labour leader Keir Starmer said “nobody should be seeking to take advantage of this crisis”.Prof David Oliver, an NHS consultant physician, has said that there is a “constant anxiety” among healthcare workers that they could become infected. He told the BBC:We’re telling everybody else stay at home and don’t mingle. But its the nature of our work that we have to come into buildings every day and come into contact with clinical colleagues and we don’t know what members of the team have already been infected.Police have visited Scotland’s chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood and issued her with a warning after she visited her second home. Scotland’s chief constable Iain Livingstone said in a statement:Earlier today, local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted. The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone.The former boss of the McLaren Formula One team, businessman Ron Dennis, has launched an initiative to provide one million free meals to frontline NHS workers. He said he co-founded SalutetheNHS.org to feed thousands of hospital staff because he was “in awe” of their work to save lives during the coronavirus pandemic. This is a time when all of us, iniduals and businesses alike, need to stand up and be counted in the effort to combat Covid-19. We’re all in this together. I am delighted to be leading this initiative to help ensure that vital NHS workers have nutritious meals while they work every hour in this fight. It means they have one less thing to worry about. The Dennis family is donating £1m through their charity foundation Dreamchasing, alongside 500,000 in match-funding. Tesco will donate food for the meals and the initiative is supported by catering group Absolute Taste and delivery service Yodel. Meals will be made available, for free, to ICU teams, anaesthetic teams and A\u0026ampE staff who are unable to leave their clinical areas during their 12-hour shifts. Deliveries will start at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford tomorrow and at London children’s hospital Great Ormond Street the following week, before being rolled out to Government-targeted locations. Thousands of casual workers at some of English football’s biggest stadiums have been left unpaid during the Covid-19 shutdown, the  understands.A number of employees from Delaware North – which provides catering and hospitality services at venues such as the Emirates Stadium, London Stadium, Wembley, Craven Cottage and the Ricoh Arena – have contacted the  after seeing booked shifts cancelled and receiving no payments since the Premier League season halted last month.Some of the workers, who are on zero-hour or casual arrangements, feel increasingly desperate. The casual workers complain the company has told them there are no shifts for them because of the impact of Covid-19 and that it is trying to establish whether they are eligible to be furloughed under the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme.A long-standing casual employee at one of the venues told the  that they work there for up to five days a week but saw that income stream removed as soon as the season was paused. They said they had received no payment for the shifts they had committed to.Lord Bath of Longleat has died aged 87 after testing positive for coronavirus.Alexander Thynn, the 7th Marquess of Bath, died on Saturday after being admitted to the Royal United Hospital in Bath on March 28. During his time there, it was confirmed that he had Covid-19. Longleat Safari Park confirmed the news in a Facebook post on Sunday, expressing their “deepest sadness” at Lord Bath’s death. The family would like to express their great appreciation for the dedicated team of nurses, doctors and other staff who cared so professionally and compassionately for Alexander in these extremely difficult times for everyone. They would politely request a period of privacy to deal with their loss.Aspects of our national life are suddenly in the foreground – from the NHS, through all those low-paid key workers, to spontaneous community initiatives that transcend most of the social ides we were told were insurmountable, writes the ’s John Harris. If the Conservatives cannot turn them into a national story, someone else should at least try – not for immediate electoral gain, but for two other reasons. In the short-term, it could help many of us to get out of bed every morning and face the day. Looking further ahead, it might start to map out what kind of country we might become when the horrors of the coronavirus begin to recede."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212069.1585154265!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we ve gone from housing hens to online supermarket dependency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupermarkets emptied of eggs, Britons are seeking hens for their back gardens – such a bonanza for the UK’s urban foxes. Illustration: Michael VineyThe song thrush joins me half an hour before dawn, perching on the bare, topmost branch of the hawthorn outside my workroom window.He sings steadily, facing the sea, the top notes a bit muffled by the double glazing, while I bring up the papers on desktop to see how much worse things have got.As the sky lightens and goldfinches start squabbling at the nuts, the slope of fields sharpens to the sea. Electricity poles march away between the sheep, their rain-rinsed fleeces echoed in the white line of surf beyond the dunes.To look at such distances is a luxury. Even a pallid, featureless ocean, its islands blurred in drizzle, is calming to the mind. And on the acre itself, so raw late into leaf, the primroses shine.“If you’ve got enough land to grow potatoes for a year, there’s nothing they can do to you really.” I wrote that when I was still in my 40s and fresh to the challenge of “alternative” rural living.Still here at 87 and somewhat slowed down by respiratory ills from a chain-smoking youth, I am blessed with a partner who, down on the floor for her morning exercises, insists on staying fit and able at 91. We share a privileged isolation, separately glued to broadband to follow the news and to carry our chronicles of the natural world.Most of the acre that grew a year’s potatoes is now shaded with trees or tangled with a dense scrub of fuchsia and briars. All this shelters a polytunnel with a ridge of early potatoes, the first instalment of a quite re-energised urge to get things growing.Wooden arkI ventured past the tunnel in bright sunshine, armoured with prickle-proof welder’s gauntlets and the secateurs. The path leads on into the trees, but briars have arched their grapnels from the hedge bank to root at the other side.These severed and yanked up, I pressed on to find, immured in shadows and brambles, the wooden ark I made for the hens in the days when I still could do anything. Disdained now even by owls or bats, its marine plywood stood darkly intact. Its intricate carpentry (six nest boxes, recycled windows, a sliding droppings tray) had put me at a pinnacle of DIY achievement, as if I had built a boat.The ark had housed Rhode Island Red Light Sussex crosses, all of them brightly aware and fluffily warm to stir off their eggs: I still know the feel of their feathers.The first dozen were renewed after the inevitable fox, discovering the door still open at dusk, compulsively slew them all and carried some to cache in a hole up the hill. And the ducks, while I’m at it, were finally abandoned after visits by stoat and otter, and from my own dismay at having to “cull” the ducklings at 10 weeks, taffeta-crisp and pristine.What took me back to the old henhouse was learning that, supermarkets emptied of eggs, Britons were seeking hens for their back gardens – such a bonanza for the UK’s urban foxes.Our own eggs now come from SuperValu, commendably delivering from Westport, 35km away. Thus, long after years of a hectic self-reliance, through bees, goats, geese and fish from a spillet, we share the same grateful online dependency as the harried world beyond the hill.The polytunnel is a treasured remnant of endeavour, like the seedlings on my warm workroom window-sill: peas, lettuce, courgettes, beetroot, cavalo nero kale. Tomatoes, sown far too soon, are planted in the tunnel, stoically surviving under fleece the chilly nights of spring.Garden gossipThis is garden gossip to encourage citizens who are putting their daily exercise into skinning the lawn for instant raised vegetable beds (Quickcrop delivers them) or, starting from scratch, sowing online seeds at just the right time.And after it all ends, whenever that is, what shape will things be in?Back in the 1970s, “organic” was still a hippy word, like “self-sufficiency” and “saving nature”. All that flowed into the new recognition of ecology.The early intellectual drive came mainly from the US, from disciples of “deep ecology” and “Earth First!” That was reinforced by Lovelock’s theory of Gaia, the Earth as self-managing organism, and the mounting crisis of climate change.Still passionate in defence of closer bonds with nature, its threads vibrate, for example, through the online journal Ecological Citizen, offering papers on “eco-anarchism” or a “Nietzschean land ethic”.Since the 1970s the lure of a little land on which to try out new personal skills has taken many away from the city, repelled by corporate culture and consumerism. The social and economic turmoil of Covid-19 and its aftermath may well see a resurgence of inidual and communal withdrawal from outworn and growth-driven forms of capitalism."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

But ultimately what we are trying to do is suppress this epidemic, and control it insofar as we can.”Modelling shows restrictions can control and reduce cases of infections, Dr De Gascun said.“Ultimately it is down to us as a society to control this because there is no magic bullet at this point in time, so restrictions will stay in place until we can see significant evidence that we are controlling or flattening the curve,” he added.A time delay between restrictions being implemented and taking effect – if they are effective – means Ireland will only find out in the coming seven to 10 days whether the tightened measures ordered by the Government last week have been successful.“These next two weeks are really crucial for us,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4221265.1586077882!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 testing irish pharma firms source raw material to make reagent","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoggers pass a sign for a testing centre in Newbridge in Co Kildare. Photograph: PA  Firms within the Irish pharmaceutical industry have sourced a raw material from Europe that can be used to produce scarce chemical reagents that has delayed coronavirus testing.Global shortages in supplies of reagents used by labs to test swab samples taken from suspected Covid19-infected patients has meant testing fell dramatically short of Government targets. The shortage meant the State’s health authorities could only carry out 1,500 tests a day, far short of its daily target of 15,000 tests. HSE chief executive Paul Reid said last week that Ireland was in a “chase around the world” with other countries to access supplies of reagents. Widespread testing is seen as a key objective worldwide in the fight against the virus. Chemical materials used to make the reagents are also in short supply given the demand in many countries. Pharmaceutical companies sought to help the Department of Health and HSE with testing by using their own networks of suppliers to source raw material to make the reagents within the State.The firms were seeking a specific chemical compound called guanidine thicyanate in order to make a solution called a reagent called lysis buffer that is used to inactivate the virus and break open cells in order to identify their genetic make-up to confirm whether a patient has the virus. The compound was sourced by Clonmel company Camida. If it arrives in Ireland over the coming days, reagent can be produced for testing within weeks.“We hope to get it in next week. It is waiting to be shipped,” Matt Moran, director of the pharmaceutical industry lobby group BioPharmaChem Ireland told The . “If we can get it in next week, we should be able to start making it. It will be weeks rather than months. We are aiming to get it out in the next couple of weeks.” The group believes that it can source chemical material to make enough reagent in the State to be able to carry out around 500,000 tests. The lobby group did not want to disclose the name of the European country where it has sourced the raw material given the level of demand for it.“Finding it has been a bit of an achievement. There were a number of countries looking for it and we beat them to it,” said Mr Moran.The pharmaceutical companies which hoped to make the reagents for use as part of the HSE testing are multinational firms operating in Ireland. “These plants are all in production and fully operational. They don’t want to be named. They want to do this as a kind of national interest effort,” he said.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship.

Why?While the smaller population of some of the eastern European nations must of course be taken into account, it seems their more recent experience of emergencies has stood them in better stead than their more pampered neighbours. Georgia’s Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, of the Georgia Dream party, told the Daily  it wasn’t just down to its “early and decisive executive action but because: “Georgians have experienced and overcome adversity throughout history.“Both the Government and the Georgian public quickly realised the scale of this threat,” he added. “Early action was crucial­ both to fight the virus and to protect the economy.”As Alexander Scrivener of the Eurasia Democratic Security Network recently explained in a paper on the subject: “Being rich doesn’t guarantee effective policy in a time of crisis. Early signs are that wealthier European countries have tended to respond less effectively than poorer ones - at least initially.”Comparing Georgia with the Netherlands, which both confirmed their first cases at roughly the same time at the end of February, he theorised that “the real number of Dutch cases is in the tens of thousands, while Georgia is likely still in double figures” because the former closed its borders, introduced strict social distancing measures and halted all air traffic while the latter’s reaction was “highly complacent.”In Holland, he added: “Business as usual was king. Preventing “panic” (which there was no evidence of) was prioritised over actually combating the virus.”As he endorsed a plan for ‘herd immunity’ as ill-fated at Britain’s Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte even proudly boasted that theirs was a “down-to-earth nation”. Only when the deaths started mounting did the government begin to act and introduce, largely voluntary, social distancing. As in Sweden, the Dutch are now facing criticism for their lackadaisical approach. Scrivener puts the vastly differing approaches down to the fact that countries with a ‘recent memory’ of facing major societal crisis have innately responded much more proactively than those without such chequered histories. “What links the Asian countries that have so effectively contained the virus, post-Communist states like Georgia and austerity-battered southern European countries like Greece is recent memory of crisis. Conversely, countries that have enjoyed relative calm and prosperity, even in the wake of the 2008 crash, like the Netherlands, UK and USA, were notably slow to even recognise the threat.”Professor Kataryna Wolczuk, Professor of East European Politics at the Centre for Russian, European and Eurasian Studies, agrees.“It isn’t just that some of these former Soviet countries have encountered more adversity, it is also that they already know their health care systems cannot cope. People in the UK know they can rely on the NHS - expectations are exaggerated.”Pointing out that post independence in 1991, the 3.7 million strong Georgian population had to grow used to regular electricity “blackouts” and having to bribe doctors for treatment, she added: “They have in their living memory times when it was really tough. They know they have to self-preserve and that they cannot afford to be blase.”Now medical professionals, the police and the military are no longer corrupt in Georgia, they are put on a pedestal by the population. “If a doctor says something then the people of Georgia will listen and obey,” the professor added. “They are used to obeying orders.”She added that this was in marked contrast to countries like Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Belarus, where more authoritarian governments were “keener on trying to spin a success story than solving the issue.” Mistrust of those governments meant fewer people tended to follow the guidance. Igor Grazin, a major force in the Estonian independence movement and elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1991 under Boris Yeltsin, said smaller European countries like his were benefiting from their experience of border control and providing overseas aid in times of crisis.“When you have a country like Estonia that has fought for independence then it protects its borders better than many others, he said.“We have spent years preparing for Russian invasion, so by comparison coronavirus isn’t that difficult.”A state of emergency was declared there on March 13 after coronavirus was brought to Saaremaa Island by the Italian volleyball club Power Volley Milano, that participated in the 2019–20 CEV Challenge Cup. All public gatherings were banned, including sports and cultural events schools and universities were closed and border control was restored with health checks at every crossing and entry point.Explaining how the country’s military medical service had been deployed to treat the diseased and dying, he added: “Smaller countries like ours, because we can’t contribute troops and tanks like the UK, France and Germany, our function in NATO operations has always been to provide medical support. We have a very effective medical corps and corps of engineers who have served out in the middle East and Africa dealing with other diseases. So our speciality in medicine has come in very useful.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/11/01/TELEMMGLPICT000145320425_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"do not fooled keir starmer no centrist","story":"While Corbyn spouted the politics of the student union, Starmer waged his own ideological battle to stop BrexitAside from Jeremy Corbyn, there can be no other Labour politician who bears more responsibility for the party’s crushing defeat at the last election than Sir Keir Starmer. While Corbyn spouted the politics of the student union and opened the door to toxic extremism, Starmer was waging his own ideological battle – to stop Brexit.As shadow Brexit secretary, he offered sincere assurances that Labour would respect the referendum result. But, as director of communications at No 10, I saw first-hand how Labour’s new leader sought to block our departure from the EU. I sat in on many of the cross-party Brexit talks and witnessed how he would frustrate any progress with endless objections. This reached farcical levels on one occasion when he branded the language of one government document as totally unacceptable, only to be told the text had been cut and pasted from a Labour paper.Ultimately the public was not fooled, either by the “lawyer’s Brexit” that Starmer offered up or by public assurances that Labour would respect the referendum. He now has a mountain to climb when it comes to reconnecting with voters. How he approaches the terrible Covid-19 pandemic will be a major test of whether he can win back their trust.If ever there was a time to transcend the boundaries of political tribalism, it is now. The Prime Minister yesterday wrote to party leaders urging them to “work together” with the Government. But will Starmer be able to resist playing politics with this pandemic? My guess is not. In his acceptance speech, he insisted he would work with the Government but would “challenge” and “call out” ministers if necessary. He went on to lay out a key battle line that will emerge when Britain breaks free from the pandemic – public sector pay.It seems, as with Brexit, that Starmer will insist he is putting politics to one side, while in reality indulging in the same old point-scoring. This political profiteering will only serve to ide when we should all unite. We are all on the same side in this war and Starmer would be wise to avoid going down this route. Daily press conferences mean the public have access to Government information as never before.They can judge for themselves whether ministers are doing everything possible. These ministers will rightly be held to account over the roll-out of testing – as they have been over protective equipment, intensive care beds and ventilators – but only those blinded by ideology would doubt their determination to beat this virus.I fear Starmer may be no more capable of breaking free from his own form of political tribalism than Corbyn was. He is not from the hard Left of the party like his predecessor – but he’s no centrist either. He is a true believer in the ideology of woke. As a human rights lawyer, he has dedicated his career to pursuing radical change in society through the courts, and being well paid for it. He represented poll tax rioters and striking print workers at Wapping. He helped eco-warriors in their bid to physically block road-widening schemes and often worked against the police.He is fully signed up to the articles of faith of the London metropolitan elite: supportive of open-door immigration, fiercely anti-Brexit, suspicious of patriotism and desperate to blame society rather than criminals for crime. The reason Labour lost dozens of seats in the North and Midlands was that traditional Labour voters realised the party was distant from their concerns and beliefs. Worse, it had contempt for them.So yes, Starmer will bring order to the grotesque chaos of today’s Labour Party, he will make his arguments in a reasonable tone and he will get a hearing. But in the end he is too immersed in the gospel of the progressive elite to be able to reach out to the communities abandoned by Labour. Above all, he won’t do the crucial thing that all successful leaders of the opposition do: he won’t challenge his party activists to look at themselves in the mirror and ask why the public rejected them.The Labour leadership election lasted for months, but not once did its eventual victor challenge the prejudices of Labour members. Political parties win elections by moving out of their ideological comfort zones and standing firmly in the mainstream, where the general public is. That’s why Keir Starmer is not the answer to Labour’s problems.Sir Robbie Gibb is a senior adviser at Kekst CNC and a former director of communications at 10 Downing StreetThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Iceland is doing both.Mr Gudnason\u0027s team of 60 police investigators and healthcare workers act as detectives on each confirmed case, tracking down those they have come in contact with.  Testing is carried out by The National Health Service on those showing symptoms. But on top of this, a biopharma company, deCODE Genetics, has been screening random samples of the population to build the world\u0027s most extensive study yet of how the virus behaves in a population.Early results show 50 per cent of carriers of the virus are asymptomatic. It has also revealed up to 40 \u0027mutations\u0027, or strains, of the disease. They claim to have traced strains back to Italy, Austria, the US, and seven cases in particular to one undisclosed football match in the UK.Crucially, all the testing has meant Iceland has been able to avoid a lockdown or quarantine as cases are tracked, traced and isolated before spreading rapidly - thus alleviating pressure on the hospitals.The data rolling in has meant authorities can more accurately design methods of controlling the virus, Mr Stefánsson says.So far there is a government ban on gatherings of more than 20 people and light guidelines on social distancing.The guidance is imposed not by force but by trust, Katrín Jakobsdottir, Iceland\u0027s prime minister, tells The  .Iceland has a history of socially liberal culture, she says. That means acceptance of differences and minorities, but in this case, it means to trust, not to force. We have no tradition of militarism or an army. We ask for cooperation, rather than force it.  She adds that the science approach allows her to leave the virus policy out of the battlefield of politics.The limited guidelines means business is slow for most shops, but with few exceptions the country is open for business.Icelanders can still get their morning coffee, sit down at local bookshops. Even stop at a local ice-cream parlour.At Reykjavík Roasters, a small but popular independent cafe in Reykjavík\u0027s centre, customers trickle in despite the pandemic. The city\u0027s centre is unusually calm.“Honestly, what I miss more than anything are the public pools” pensioner Auður Styrkásdóttir says apologetically, adding “this is a luxury.”One of the main benefits of Iceland\u0027s system is the school programme has been largely unaffected.Pre-schools, primary, and secondary schools have stayed open while higher education has moved online.Some people have taken to social media asking why children\u0027s safety is perhaps taken less seriously than those of adult students.Mr Gudnason points out that closing down institutions that serve children has a more significant social impact Our study suggests that children are less effective in spreading this virus than adults. We measure every decision with it\u0027s effectiveness and closing these institutions is unlikely to produce meaningful results at this time.Part of Iceland\u0027s success story is it\u0027s readiness.We realised at the end of 2019 that we should prepare for a pandemic, Mr Gudnason says.Our emergency system is clear, it is efficient and importantly frequently in use. Be it storms, avalanches, volcanic eruptions or a pandemic the system is the same. Health authorities step into a well-oiled machine, highly trained infrastructure and years of experience in building communication channels and trust.On Friday the head of Iceland\u0027s response, Víðir Reynisson, warned against drawing too much from the Iceland model, pointing out that the country\u0027s size, strong channels of communication and social cohesion helped.There are many factors that make things easier on us, he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korean coronavirus testing experience uk should follow","story":"My eyes watered as the cotton swab was inserted deep into my nose. Then the faceless men in full hazmat suits followed it up with a stick down my throat which made me gag a little.I watched as medics moved around behind the screen in the bright white pop-up walk-through testing booth. It was unnerving and surreal I felt like I was in a nuclear war sci-fi film.But after 45 seconds I had been tested for coronavirus and was told I would receive my results the following day, calming my nerves.South Korea has attracted international attention for its rigorous testing system that is said to have helped contain the virus that looked at the early stages to be out of control. The country is now the envy of places like the UK, which seems to be floundering miles behind when it comes to tracking and, ultimately, stopping the virus.My testing experience started with a routine hospital appointment near my home in Gyeongju, where I teach at the university.I reported to the reception and had my temperature taken, as is now standard. My temperature reading was slightly high and this combined with the fact I had traveled from Gyeongju (which is located in the North-Gyeongsang Province and close to Daegu where the highest number of cases in Korea had been reported) caused some concern.I was directed to another tent where my temperature was taken again and I was asked to fill out a questionnaire. Questions included whether I’d had a cough, cold or any flu-like symptoms or if I was part of Shincheonji, the church where the main clusters of COVID-19 cases in South Korea have occurred.Although I answered no to all the questions I wasn’t able to enter the hospital but a helpful member of staff collected my prescription for me.The staff asked me if I wanted to take a COVID-19 test. It was voluntary but having a slightly high temperature I decided to take the test for W120,000 (£80). I was escorted to another tent where I was greeted by staff in hazmat suits. That\u0027s where my nostrils and throat were scraped with swabs. I was told I would receive a message the next day with the results.At 11am the next day I got a text message in Korean confirming my COVID-19 test was negative. Although I hadn’t been showing any symptoms I was nervous about the results as you can get COVID-19 asymptomatically. I was relieved when the tests showed negative.Being in semi-lockdown since the end of February has been a shock to the system. My wife and I only go out to get essentials and to walk the dogs. Wearing a mask outside is slowly becoming second nature because the majority of other people are doing similar.Things are slowly coming back to normal with the election trucks and their cheerleaders blasting out music for the upcoming local elections on the April 15. Arguably this is the best time of year in Korea as it’s cherry blossom season.My wife and I drove around Gyeongju to see the cherry blossoms, the roads were busy and many people were outside wearing masks taking pictures. Stil,l it’s not yet the time to be in large crowds of people and common sense needs to prevail. The second wave of COVID-19 could be around the corner, the major issue is complacency and people no longer adhering to the rules during this outbreak.The lessons learned from SARS and more recently MERS has definitely helped here. The majority of people are following social distancing and government advice.The amount of emergency alerts have slowed down compared to the end of February with the amount of cases currently being on average 100 a day compared to over 750 a day at its peak.Emergency alerts showing the movements of people who tested positive for COVID-19 are sent out and it’s useful to cross reference them with your own movements. It seems the South Korean authorities are being informative and straight with people with this outbreak, and I\u0027m grateful.I am really worried about the news we keep hearing from the UK. I feel a lot safer here. I really hope my family and friends get through this unscathed and wish I could be with them.It\u0027s alarming that the UK haven\u0027t tested that much at all compared to here. I feel this should have been done weeks ago to be as effective as we have seen it to be in South Korea. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/21/15/credit-cards.jpg","title":"coronavirus overdrafts interest free credit card payments banks","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Credit card and loan repayments to be frozen for customers in financial difficulty as pandemic causes unemployment to soarBanks have been told to allow customers an extra £500 interest-free on their existing overdrafts\u0026nbspto help people who are struggling financially during the coronavirus outbreak.They have also been ordered to freeze payments on credit cards and loans.The City watchdog is proposing a range of measures that could be introduced as soon as next Thursday, to help those finding it difficult to make repayments\u0026nbspon their debts.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBanks had already been under scrutiny from the Financial Conduct Authority over their approach to overdraft interest rates, which are around 40 per cent for most high street lenders –\u0026nbsproughly double the cost of an average credit card.More people are likely to have to use their overdraft during the crisis.The Department for Work and Pensions revealed this week that it had received\u0026nbsp950,000 claims for Universal Credit in just two weeks.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastUnder the FCA’s plans, customers can ask their bank to freeze payments on their credit cards and personal loans if they are having trouble repaying because of coronavirus.However, consumers will still accrue interest on their credit cards during the repayment holiday, which they will have to pay off at some point.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “This is yet another, important, welcome, yet unprecedented coronavirus-driven market intervention – this time by the regulator.“We have already seen many unsecured lenders put some forbearance criteria in place, a few even more generous than the minimum standards the FCA is imposing – such as entire overdrafts at 0 per cent.“However the provision is patchy and has become a banking lottery and that’s unfair – no one could’ve taken into account when they signed up for products how considerate each lender would be in these extraordinary times.”A brief consultation on the proposals is under way until Monday with changes to be implemented on Thursday, if agreed.

While its first series was a critical triumph, gained fans including Barack Obama and won many Emmy awards, the show\u0026nbsphas also been accused of being “bigoted”.Writer and filmmaker Laura Durkay wrote in the Washington Post in 2014: “Since its first episode, Homeland has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by\u0026nbspproducers to make a Syrian refugee camp look more authentic, secretly wrote: “Homeland is racist.” No one noticed\u0026nbspuntil the episode was broadcast.In a rare interview with , Danes said: “That was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.”Kate Russell: ‘We all participate in a culture that allows abuse’Netflix is releasing a bonus episode of Tiger King ‘next week’On the broader issue of racism in the show, she added: “I get it. I think it’s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren’t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic.“That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We’re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters.”She continued: “In most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who’s really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.”The first episode\u0026nbspof Homeland season eight\u0026nbspwas given three stars by The Independent’s critic Ed Cumming, who said “all its life” comes from Danes and her performance as CIA operative Carrie Mathison.He wrote: “Mathison’s troubled mind has always been a metaphor for government intelligence: brilliant but unreliable, vital but dangerous. Danes’ performance animates not only the scenes but the ones she is not in, too, and every time she’s out of shot you crave her return.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of those, 22 have already shut.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA further administration is now being considered with KPMG among the firms said to be in the running to handle it.Sky News reported that Debenhams could file a notice of intention to appoint administrators as next week but other options are being explored.Mike Ashley funding lawsuit to ‘eliminate Debenhams as a competitor’A spokesperson for the retailer\u0026nbspsaid: Like all retailers, Debenhams is making contingency plans reflecting the extraordinary current circumstances.Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation.While our stores remain closed in line with government guidance, and the majority of our store-facing colleagues have been furloughed, our website continues to trade and we are accepting customer orders, gift cards and returns.”Debenhams put most of its workforce on furlough last week after closing all 140 of its UK stores as the country entered lockdown to slow the spread of Covid-19.The move means the government is covering up to 80 per cent of employees\u0027 salaries under the Coronavirus Job retention Scheme.The BBC reported this week that Debenhams was to launch a major restructuring after seeking an urgent deal with its landlords.

It is vital that everyone adhered to these requirements.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go.”Scotland\u0027s Constitution Secretary Mike Russell said there was no doubt Dr Calderwood\u0027s visit was ill-advised. The\u0026nbspScottish Government confirmed was an overnight stay to check on a family home.Mr Russell said she would be answerable for her decision when she appears at the daily coronavirus briefing with Nicola Sturgeon later today.He added: I\u0027m saying to everybody... do not go out except in the very exceptional circumstances that are listed, think about these things and remember by breaking them you are risking lives.Scottish Police Federation general secretary Calum Steele said policing the pandemic had been made more difficult and stressed checking on a second home is not one of the reasonable excuses providing an exception to emergency coronavirus legislation.He tweeted: In defending the indefensible has the Scottish Government not just thrown the CMO under the bus? Checking on a 2nd home is not one of the prescribed reasonable excuses.Monica Lennon,\u0026nbspMSP for central Scotland, said in a statement on Facebook: “As the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood beams that message into our homes on behalf of the government every single day, however, she has failed to practice what she preaches. Not only is this hypocritical, it is irresponsible and the First Minister cannot accept this conduct.“Hundreds of Scots have died and there is no sign of the spread of the virus slowing. The CMO has undermined Scotland’s pandemic response and if she doesn’t offer her resignation the First Minister should sack her.”Reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

From a young age,\u0026nbspRayner\u0026nbspacted as a carer for her mother, at times having to bathe and feed her.Corbyn was a disaster for five years – let’s not rehabilitate him nowAt one point,\u0026nbspRayner\u0026nbspwas forced to have her mother admitted to a mental health ward because she was struggling with suicidal thoughts.Rayner\u0026nbsphas spoken movingly about being told she would “never amount to anything” after becoming\u0026nbsppregnant at 16 and leaving school without any qualifications.\u0026nbspShe credits New Labour’s Sure Start centres, where she took a parenting course,\u0026nbspwith helping her find her feet.Showing the determination that would later power her political career,\u0026nbspRayner\u0026nbspwent to college part time and then got a job as one of the youngest home helps in Stockport.She became a trade union representative, later rising to become Unison’s most senior official in the northwest.In 2015\u0026nbspRayner\u0026nbspwas elected as MP for\u0026nbspAshton-under-Lyne. In her maiden speech, she talked of how her detractors put her down, saying: “If only they could see me now.”She nominated Andy Burnham to be Labour leader in 2015 but she was one of few\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho supported Jeremy Corbyn when he was challenged by Owen Smith the following year.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her nominations for the deputy leadership came from across the different parts of the parliamentary party, from left wingers such as her friend\u0026nbspRebecca Long-Bailey and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, to moderates such as Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves.Plenty of\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsphave said privately that they wish she had gone for the top job instead of backing Long-Bailey, her friend and flatmate. Rayner\u0026nbsphas spoken openly about the challenges women from her background face, which\u0026nbspclearly played a part in her decision to run for the number two role.But keeping her powder dry may also prove smart in the long run, considering the uphill battle the new party leader faces.Tony Blair on how Labour can learn from his time in power to win againOut in the country, she received more than four times the number of constituency party nominations than her nearest rival Dawn Butler, by 363 to 82. And she won the backing of several big unions – a critical step for any MP with leadership ambitions.Rayner’s significant early lead meant the other candidates had to be more outspoken and colourful to attract attention.By contrast,\u0026nbspher campaign was relatively low profile –\u0026nbspone of her few similarities with Boris Johnson, who ran an almost submarine-like\u0026nbspbid to be Conservative leader in 2019.The\u0026nbspAshton-under-Lyne\u0026nbspMP\u0026nbspwas careful not to squander her lead, making\u0026nbspthoughtful interventions and granting relatively few interviews.Her down-to-earth nature and\u0026nbspher honesty over her early experiences of deprivation appear to have done much of the heavy lifting for her, making her relatable\u0026nbspto many voters.A pragmatist at heart, Rayner\u0026nbspbased her deputy leadership\u0026nbspcampaign on calls for “everyday socialism that’s rooted in peoples lives”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Health Secretary Matt Hancock and NHS staff stand on marks on the ground, put in place to ensure social distancing guidelines are adhered to, at the opening of the NHS Nightingale Hospital at the ExCel centre in London, a temporary hospital with 4000 beds which has been set up for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.

This is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the actions of a minority now means that, following police advice, Brockwell Park will be closed tomorrowWe are sorry we\u0027ve had to take this decision. This wouldn\u0027t need to happen if people followed the clear instructions from the Govt. We are doing this for the wider safety of the public. A minority of people have not followed the guidance - regrettably we have to act.His remarks come as ministers urged the British public to avoid leaving their homes this weekend for all but essential reasons, as the country experiences some of the warmest weather of the year so far.The latest government figures show a further 708 people in the UK had lost their lives after contracting coronavirus, including seven healthcare professions, bringing the total death toll to 4,313.Mr Hancock also insisted Boris Johnson was in “good spirits” as he continues to self-isolate in Downing Street after testing positive for the virus over a week ago. He has “very much got his hand on the tiller – but he’s still got a temperature,” the minister added.And the health secretary admitted it would be “hard” to meet the government’s target to roll out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, saying it would require “an awful lot of people to put their shoulders to the wheel”.He continued: “We set a goal of 10,000 tests a day by the end of March and we hit that goal. At the end of February we had under 2,000 tests a day, so we are on a very rapid ramp-up but we clearly need to see that go further.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So who might replace them?The most important pick and biggest clue to Sir Keir’s leadership plans will be who he puts in charge of the finances – just as Mr Corbyn’s choice of Mr McDonnell signalled his “no compromise” style. Two names are in the frame:•\u0026nbspRachel Reeves – a former Bank of England economist who wrote a study on the 2008 financial crash.\u0026nbspShe was sent into exile by the Corbyn revolution but has the intellectual credentials and has impressed as head of the Commons business committee.•\u0026nbspAnneliese Dodds – unlike her potential rival, she served the outgoing leader as a Treasury spokesperson, and won plaudits for her media appearances, without being stained by the failed project.The prominent Labour Party names who look to be in line for a return from the backbenches include:•\u0026nbspYvette Cooper – a cabinet member more than 20 years ago, she flirted with a leadership bid this year before deciding she had no chance of winning, but still hungers after a leading role.•\u0026nbspEd Miliband – could the former leader, to whom Sir Keir is sometimes compared, make a comeback, perhaps to pursue his passion for tackling climate change?The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email•\u0026nbspDavid Lammy – once tipped to be Britain’s first black cabinet minister, he has thrived on the backbenches as a fierce critic of Brexit and of the Windrush scandal.•\u0026nbspHilary Benn – a forensic critic of the government’s EU policy, as the Commons Brexit committee chairman, he was shadow foreign secretary until sacked by Mr Corbyn in 2016.Sir Keir will want to promote from the impressive cohort of newer MPs on Labour’s benches, most probably:•\u0026nbspConor McGinn – Northern Irish, and a one-time Communist, Mr McGinn fell out with Mr Corbyn and resigned as a whip, but can be expected to return.•\u0026nbspMarsha de Cordova – only an MP since 2017, she was born with the eye condition nystagmus and is registered blind. Currently the shadow minister for disabled people.•\u0026nbspRushanara Ali – like Ms de Cordova, a London MP, Ms Ali nominated Mr Corbyn for the leadership in 2015, but turned against him a year later.Shadow cabinet jobs have been promised to the defeated Rebecca Long Bailey and Lisa Nandy, but that offer may not extend to early fallers Emily Thornberry and Jess Phillips.Asked for his favourite Labour leader, Sir Keir plumped for Harold Wilson – praising the way the infamous schemer “managed to hold bits of the party together” – but it will be a miracle if he can do the same.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was knighted in 2014 for services to law and criminal justice.In parliament, Starmer backed Andy Burnham in the 2015 leadership election and was appointed a shadow Home Office minister within months of entering the House of Commons.He quit the post in 2016 as part of a mass resignation by Labour MPs protesting about Corbyn’s leadership, but returned to the frontbench later that year as shadow Brexit secretary.In that role, he exerted pressure to shift the party’s position gradually towards support for a second EU referendum, famously declaring at the 2018 Labour conference that Remain must be on the ballot paper in any vote.As Corbyn tried to maintain an “honest broker” stance keeping both Remain and Leave options open, Starmer appeared alongside other senior figures at last October’s giant Final Say rally in Westminster to demand a public vote.His increasingly open support for a referendum infuriated some Labour MPs who blamed him for helping drive Leave-voting Labour supporters in the Midlands and North into the arms of Johnson’s Conservatives at the subsequent election.Soon after Corbyn’s announcement he was standing down, Starmer signalled his determination to hold the party’s wings together by declaring it was important for Labour not to “oversteer” away from the outgoing leader’s programme.In a list of 10 pledges, he has promised to stick to a series of Corbyn’s policies, including increasing taxes for the top 5 per cent of earners, reversing corporation tax cuts, abolishing Universal Credit, establishing a green “new deal”, scrapping university tuition fees and renationalising rail, mail, water and energy.Despite calls from some quarters for Labour to broaden its appeal by choosing a woman from outside London as its new leader, Starmer swiftly secured nominations from influential unions including Unison, Usdaw and the TSSA and took an overwhelming lead in constituency nominations, with 374 to 164 for his main rival Rebecca Long-Bailey – even picking up the support of Corbyn’s Islington North.Born in London in 1962 to a toolmaker father and nurse mother, Starmer was named after the Labour Party’s founder and first MP Keir Hardie. He passed the 11-plus to win a place at grammar school and studied law at Leeds University and Oxford, becoming a barrister in 1987.Married to Victoria with two children, his leadership campaign was disrupted by a serious accident suffered by his mother-in-law, who died on 8 February after two weeks in hospital.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Candidates had effectively suspended their campaigns last month as the infections of Covid-19 started to escalate in the UK.Coinciding with Mr Corbyn’s resignation, Boris Johnson also wrote to the leaders of opposition parties at Westminster, inviting them to a briefing of senior government advisers next week as he insisted “we have a duty to work together at this moment of the national unity”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation,” he said.He added: “Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers, visibly moved, there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.“It’s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.“Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do.“But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we’ll challenge that and call that out.”Sir Keir also said he was “sorry” on behalf of the Labour Party for the “stain” that antisemitism had brought on the party in recent years after allegations that have plagued the party under Mr Corbyn’s leadership. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he added.Former leader Mr Corbyn, who had appeared with Ms Long-Bailey in her campaigning videos, also congratulated Sir Keir on his election victory. “Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility,” he said. “I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country”.In a statement, defeated candidate Ms Long-Bailey said Sir Keir will be a “brilliant prime minister and I can’t wait to see him in No 10”, adding: “I will do all I can to make that a reality and to ensure the Labour Party gets into government with a transformative agenda at the next election.”Who will be in Starmer’s shadow cabinet?The left-wing group Momentum – set up to support Mr Corbyn’s radical, left-wing policy agenda in 2015 – said the organisation looks forward to working with him, but also pledged to hold him to account in the coming months and years.“His mandate is to build on Jeremy’s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,” they added. “In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We’ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the Green New Deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I even have iodine tablets.See  I chose THE WRONG BLOODY APOCALYPSE.I thought it was going to be nuclear bombs raining down on us. And I was well ready.But when the Four Horsemen eventually turned up, it wasn’t with nukes. It was with a bit of a bad cough.What I needed wasn’t a Geiger counter, but a ventilator. And paracetamol. How was I to know Probably because I was a Cold War kid and that’s how we all expected to go back then.Anyway, I might put my Geiger counter on Ebay.I’m asking £ or six rolls of toilet paper and some tinned tomatoes. And a Twix.And so here, in week two of the Great Lockdown, I’m pretty much useless.Unless you want to know the proportions of lead and concrete needed to minimise the radioactive fallout from a ten-megaton blast.One thing is bothering me, however.And that’s the Old Bill getting a bit overzealous in pursuit of people. Ordinary people going for a walk.A friend of mine was walking her dog in a London park when two rozzers turned up on horseback.They told her not to throw a ball for the dog.Why not  Because it might have Covid- on its fur and bump into someone .Um . . . might not the police horses also have Covid- on their fur And then there’s the Derbyshire coppers sending a drone to harass some bloke out for a walk in the Peak District. Entirely alone, not a danger to anyone.The chief plod of Derbyshire has been defending his force’s actions.Meanwhile, other forces have been naming and shaming the alleged “covidiots” on social media.I don’t think the Old Bill have ever been happier. They’re loving this.I know we must not take unnecessary journeys.I know we need to employ social distancing.People holding house parties and so on is crazy.I think the vast majority of us grasp this.But this is a tricky time.

He hasn’t thought it through no matter how many chins of mine he might think he can sht, it ain’t worth spilling perfectly good lager or ales.Nevertheless,that hyperactive chancer can unite the nation, then someone like me who doesn’t go at ramming-speed the whole time can surely help. He’s the hare, I’m the tortoise.But what this is all about is morale. Morale is important: it’s the key component of any battle and that’s what we are in the middle of right now.And as we near the end of our second week in national solitary confinement, I imagine tempers may be fraying, time might be hanging heavy, maybe the way you’re rubbing along has got you chafing a bit: I know I am, I gave up bathing last weekend, I’m on my own, who cares what I smell like.So, here’s a cut out and loose guide to how to keep your morale up and avoid those moments which lord knows you’ll regret, because it’s not like you can go down the pub and moan to your mates about what happened.Dishwasher stacking disputes. You think the knives should point up not down.The amount of times people can fall out over this sort of simple day-to-day admin in normal le is something I’ve heard from my regular drinkers time and time again, so no doubt in lockdown-land this one is raging all day, every day.You know what: forget it. It ain’t worth it. Simply rule yourself out of stacking or emptying the dishwasher – problem solved.Deciding what to watch on the TV. We live in an age of a billion channels and nothing to watch. And they’re not making any more TV either: even Eastenders could grind to a halt. Yes that’s how serious this whole thing is. So whoever has control of the TV rules the roost.The remote is the key to this problem. Seize control: seeing as you aren’t going anywhere or doing anything, superglue the remote to the hand you use the least and retain control of the TV.This may seem extreme but it’ll simply mean there’s one great big argument when you reveal what you’ve done, rather than the long slow drip drip drip of anger about your third week of watching Homes Under The Hammer.Ironing and or folding the laundry. Ironing, for some, is a % flash point. This is how the argument runs. You leave something out to dry, then some thoughtless Herbert chucks it all in a laundry basket in a heap and you have to iron it.Immediately a row ensues about why there’s no need to iron tracksuit bottoms anyway and remember the time you burned that nylon shirt because you had the iron on too hot you idiot.Compromise. Now here’s the thing. It’s not like you’ve got anywhere to be. It’s not like your glad rags are going to get any attention over the next few days.Maybe you’re a slave to fashion and were looking forward to moving from your spring to your summer wardrobe. Whatever that means. But there is no need to iron stuff right now. None. Zero.So put the iron down. Unless of course, it’s something you like doing to calm the nerves, pass the time, inject some sense of order into what is currently a formless existence. In other words, let the ironer iron. But onlytotally necessary. Remember, in the end would you rather be right or happy  And the answer to that is happy. Unless of course what makes you happy is being right. But you get my point.And remember, chins up Britain, all of them.Hats off to all the people who two weeks ago were panicking and spreading rumours about the army being deployed.During the fortnight these Scary Maries were crying into their soda waters about imminent martial law the army quietly got on with setting up a brand-new hospital.

And we have a National Health Service to look after those who need care.A mobilisation never before seen in peacetime is under way across our health service and beyond. In the NHS our dedicated staff are pulling out all the stops to treat the patients we have and prepare for the surge we know is coming.We are now looking after more than , patients in hospital with confirmed coronavirus — a staggering increase compared with just a few weeks ago.That is more coronavirus patients than the number of hospitalised heart attack, stroke and cancer patients combined.And in a matter of weeks hospitals have managed to free up a further , beds, a third of all those normally available, for future patients with coronavirus.Of course, most patients the health service is continuing to look after have some condition other than coronavirus.And it is important that other patients still come forward for the urgent and emergency care they need without delay.Increasing our critical care capacity for those who are sickest is a top priority.And we are setting up new hospitals at a rate never seen before.The new NHS Nightingale in London is the most visible example of the extraordinary effort that is under way to tackle coronavirus.The NHS has joined forces with the military to achieve in days what normally takes years.More such hospitals are in train across the country — in Bristol, in Yorkshire, in Birmingham and in Manchester. I hope they won’t be needed, but we’re building them in case they are.They are an insurance policy in case the surge plans at existing hospitals are not enough.But these new facilities and kit are nothing without the staff that make the NHS what it is today — the institution our nation rightly holds most dear.More than , former nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have heeded the call to re-enlist for the battle against coronavirus.And many thousands of student nurses and medical students will be putting their skills and education into practice early as part of the enormous effort that is under way to save more lives.But the NHS cannot win this war alone. Companies and the Government are now pulling together to get us the extra equipment and supplies the NHS needs. British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator. Over the coming weeks, by staying at home you save lives. It’s as simple and as profound as that.

There’s plenty we could do in the house such as cleaning, exercising, contacting family or friends, learn a new skill etc.“Also remember that, just like being at sea, isolation won’t last forever.

Since Boris Johnson declared the lockdown restrictions on our lives, officers have been accused by some of being overzealous enforcing them.They have tried to stop some shops selling Easter eggs because they consider them non-essential.A cop was also filmed threatening to fine a bakery owner for putting chalk on the pavement outside her shop to maintain social-distancing.Meanwhile, the Derbyshire force dyed black the Blue Lagoon swim spot in a disused Buxton quarry to deter groups from gathering there — and sent out drones to spy on walkers in the middle of nowhere.Road blocks have been set up to check motorists and cyclists are on essential journeys.Last weekend officers were also breaking up groups of more than two people on park benches, and football matches in parks.All of which could seem a tad heavy-handed.So you can see why some people are indignant, especially given the absence of clearer official guidance.Perhaps it is this lack of clarity that is partly the issue.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a recent daily press conference that police should use common sense in applying the rules and that the public should follow the guidance not just to the letter but also the spirit.The real issue, though, is some people’s inability to follow the very basic instruction to stay at home unless they really need to go out.If people were not disregarding this advice, police would not have to enforce it.Officers do need to be careful, though.We are willing to social-distance for the greater good but only as long as it is necessary — and will not tolerate it for a minute longer.We are not a police state and the police must be mindful of being too heavy-handed.So while shouting at someone for buying an Easter egg is ridiculous and using a drone to terrorise a lone dog walker does seem extreme, someone has to break up the cretins who are having barbecues or parties in high-density residential areas, right I do despair over the attitude of those mindless idiots who are still having parties and getting drunk together.Then there are the twits going to DIY shops to buy paint, which is hardly essential.People, this is not an extended Bank Holiday. It is a lockdown.It is being done to save your le or the le of someone you love.The bottom line is that officers have to ensure the guidelines are adhered to, but it is how they go about it that is important.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealIn the meantime, police chiefs are urging snoopers to use online hotlines to tell tales about neighbours who are breaching the Government’s lockdown.Humberside has created a dedicated online portal where people can submit tip-offsthey spot gatherings of more than two people.West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and Avon and Somerset are urging the public to alert them to breaches by using online forums, rather than phoning  or .To my mind, this raises ethical questions.hould we really become a nation of snitches Should we not all just concentrate on our own families and trust that others will take care of themselves Is the act of reporting the selfish idiots who disregard the Government advice really community spirit Or is it just the ultimate curtain-twitching exercise — which encourages serious pettiness Apparently, the police have had calls from people asking them to come and arrest a neighbour for going on a second run in one day.In an ideal world we would all just abide by the rules and there would be no need to report others.Sadly, though, needs must.If your neighbour is driving to the seaside when you are stuck indoors at home, they are ruining the purpose of this lockdown for everyone, they are selfish and they should be stopped.If people do not abide by the rules, what choice do you have Butyou do just stay home there will be no need to worry about whether your neighbours are phoning the police about you.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

This is nowhere near good enough.As Boris Johnson croaked from his sick bed, mass testing among the general population is the ONLY way out of this national purgatory.But at the moment we do not even have widespread testing among our NHS workers.Right now we are letting down those selfless doctors, nurses and health carers.On Thursday night at pm, my street in North London resounded to the sound of grateful clapping for our carers.But as our frontline health workers start to die, they need more than a weekly standing ovation.They need us to understand that the lockdown rules apply to us all.Lucy Hutchings, , is a nurse caring for coronavirus patients in Southampton.In a Facebook post, shared , times, she wrote it is “devastating” to see so much suffering when there are still people not following simple rules about staying home, staying safe and protecting the NHS.“I’m scared, everybody I work with is scared,” wrote Lucy, her face etched with exhaustion after another gruelling -hour sht.“The quicker people stay indoors, the quicker it will be over.“I’d like to stay at home but I can’t, so for people to go against the rules is so stupid and irresponsible.“I keep myself away from my mum, dad and brother because I don’t want to pass the virus on. It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star.

It was like her office.“Meghan is also a big fan of Erewhon, a super high-end natural foods grocer in West Hollywood, which was her health food holy grail.“She loves hiking and keeping fit, so she hopes to be able to do a few of her favourite trails, albeit with security in tow now.“She will have a private gym at the new pad, so it’s unlikely she will use one of her old spin studios like Soul Cycle.”Her mum Doria, who -year-old Harry is also close to, regularly visits the Agape Spiritual Center, a non-denominational church in the LA suburb of Culver City, and Meghan often used to accompany her to services.A source added: “That was a big part of their relationship and spiritual connection.“Some celebrities go there, so I wouldn’t be surprisedMeghan showed up there again.”The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealAlthough mother and daughter cannot see one another at present, Doria will be making extended visits to the couple’s home, once they get settled.The source continued: “Doria will definitely have a presence in their day-to-day le.“Plus, of course, she can act as a pretty wonderful babysitter for Archie.“Doria adores her grandson, and would be thrilled to help outcalled upon.”Not surprisingly, Meghan’s estranged dad Thomas, , will not be invited — even though he lives just  miles away in Rosarito, Mexico.The source added: “He is just noise for her at this point.“He would be a liability for her, with all the drama he brings to the table, while she wants to pursue a philanthropic .“Meghan has a young son now and her priority is her immediate family, her work and helping others where she can.”Undoubtedly Meghan will be using the next six months to focus on family time with Harry and their -month-old son.Being in LA, the duke and duchess are expected to employ personal trainers to get them fit for the summer months.One well-placed source also predicted the royal pair would be visitors to the Pilates studio of Meghan’s pal Heather Dorak.The insider said of the duchess: “I’m not surprised she came back.“It’s her home, and now she has the influence and star power she never had before. It’s the ideal situation for her.“She has been able to bring Harry into her perfect scenario.“I imagine she will just make it about enjoying the beach, fresh air, and being tucked away in the canyons.“Keeping it simple and finding her rhythm, being present and fit while raising Archie under the palm trees and the familiarity of her home town.“I think she will try to be very private and protective of Harry.“She will probably be getting him to make friends with the agents, managers and some stars but will try not to expose him to too many alien things.She has already got what she wants, to move to LA, and I don’t think she will want to push him too hard.”The ambitious pair have put any big announcements on hold following the outbreak of coronavirus.But a trio of power-players including Meghan’s agent at The Gersh Agency, Nick Collins, her business manager Andrew Meyer and lawyer Rick Genow, are already weighing up offers.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.A Gersh source said: “Nick has seen interest in Harry and Meghan go through the roof since they announced their split from the Royal Family.“Sure, he looks after her Hollywood opportunities, but also the volume of advertising and speaking opportunities is huge.“If they said yes to everything that was offered to them and Archie, they would be able to buy a £million Los Angeles home and have plenty of change left over.”Another home they are said to have had their eyes on is ,sq ft Petra Manor.It is in a private canyon complex called Serra Retreat, and was once owned by Hollywood actor Mel Gibson.The property, once rented by Kylie Jenner, was still available to view this week – with an eye-watering rent of £, a night.Along with Pacic Palisades, locals have also heard that Meghan and Harry are keen on a home in The Colony, the gated Malibu enclave where their neighbours would be actor Tom Hanks and former tennis champ John McEnroe. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She and her family are potentially bringing the virus to the area.”Wearing a turquoise jacket, Dr Calderwood looked like she didn’t have a care in the world as she walked with her family and dogs near her bolthole on Saturday.But locals in the quiet coastal town hit out over the seemingly unnecessary trip, which came after a working week in Edinburgh where she spoke at daily pandemic press briefings alongside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Residents accused her of failing to heed her own government’s advice that people with second properties should stay at home to protect rural communities during the outbreak.The source said Dr Calderwood was one of several other high-flyers from Edinburgh who had second properties in the area and were putting locals at risk.One onlooker told The Scottish Sun on Sunday: “They were going for a walk with the dogs. It’s weird.“I thought she lived in Edinburgh and that we were supposed to stay home — but this place is miles away.”On Thursday, Dr Calderwood shared a photo of her family outside her capital home taking part in the national Clap for Carers event.The image was posted as millions ventured on to their doorsteps to applaud our NHS heroes and care workers.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe snap was taken in the driveway of her upmarket West End home — said to be worth around £.million.Under the hashtag ‘clap for NHS’, the health bigwig told her , followers: “My family clapping my NHS and care colleagues — and me!

It is not discounted.”Downing Street has said it “does not recognise” the claims made by the source.Some unfounded conspiracy theories circulated worldwide have claimed coronavirus is a kind of man-made bioweapon, but there is no evidence of this.Wuhan is home to the Institute of Virology, the most advanced laboratory of its type in mainland China.The £million institute is just ten miles from the wildle market which is believed to have been at the centre of the outbreak.Scientists at the institute were the first to link the new coronavirus to bats.The state-run People’s Daily newspaper also boasted in  that the lab was capable of conducting experiments with “highly pathogenic microorganisms”.Unveried local claims have suggested workers at the lab became infected after being sprayed with blood, and then carried in infection into the local population.The city also has a second lab - the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control , which is just three miles from the market - which is also believed to have carried out virus experiments on animals.Video emerged last week of a Chinese scientist catching bats for viral experimentation at the WCDC.The conventional wisdom is however still that the virus passed from bats to another animal and then to humans at one of Wuhan’s so-called wet markets.Following the coronavirus outbreak, China has issued new laws that call for facilities to ensure “biological safety” and improve management of viruses.A leak from a Chinese lab led to an outbreak of Sars that killed one person and infected nine others in .The Chinese government admitted the leak was down to negligence and that five officials were punished.China has been accused of attempting to cover-up the initial outbreak as the virus took hold in the city of Wuhan.A doctor who first warned about the virus was threatened by police, and then last month Chinese officials suggested the US military may have been responsible for coronavirus.China now claims it has weathered the virus storm, and yesterday mourned victims with a three minute silence as it positions itself as a world leader amid the pandemic.In a letter to the Mail on Sunday responding claims China would face a “reckoning” from Britain over the outbreak, the Chinese embassy hit back - but declined comment on the lab origin theories.Chinese embassy official Zen Rong said: “Such reports completely disregard the tremendous efforts and huge sacrice of China and its people, and deny Chinas signicant contribution to global public health and safety.“China wasted no time in identying the viruss pathogen, sharing the genetic sequence with the World Health Organisation, taking the most effective, strict and comprehensive measures to contain the spread of the disease, sharing experience with other countries in need, and providing assistance to more than  countries, including the UK, and to four international organisations.”In a statement, an embassy spokesman added: “There has been no scientic or medical conclusion yet on the origin of Covid-, as relevant tracing work is still underway.“The WHO has made repeated statements that what the world is experiencing now is a global phenomenon, the source is undetermined, the focus should be on containment and any stigmatizing language referring to certain places must be avoided.”Questions loom large of the origins of the outbreak, and whether or not the Communist Party have been truthful over their death toll.Biosecurity researcher Richard Ebright, a professor at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, said the coronavirus behind the pandemic was . per cent similar to a bat virus discovered by the Wuhan Institute of Virology in  and studied at the WCDC.He said: “Bat coronaviruses are collected and studied by laboratories in multiple parts of China — including Wuhan Municipal CDC and Wuhan Institute of Virology.Therefore, the first human infection also could have occurred as a laboratory accident.China’s top virologist on bat-borne viruses, Shi Zhengli, has sworn on her le that virus did not leak from her lab in Wuhan.She blamed the virus has being spread by “nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits”.The researcher has told those claiming the virus came from her lab to “shut their stinking mouths”.But she previously admitted she had “lost sleep” fearing the virus may have leaked from the research facility.Politicians in both the United Kingdom and United States have previously urged China to be more open about what it knows about the coronavirus.Writing in thelast month, Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee called from greater transparency from China.Mr Ellwood, a former captain in the British Army, said it would “irresponsible” to outright blame the Chinese military – but said his job requires he understands “threats facing the UK”.He wrote: “I would like to know more about the Chinese army’s [lab], coincidentally located a stones throw from where the latest outbreak began.”He added: “Successive US administrations have long believed that a number of countries, including China, maintain active biological programmes.“But without greater Chinese transparency we cannot be completely sure.

Number one on our risk register was this, number two was the kind of terrorist attack that we saw in Mumbai for the first time you’ll remember back in . Those two things were top of our Risk Register, we had dress rehearsals for them. When I first became Health Secretary in , I walked straight into a dress rehearsal for how we’d deal with a pandemic and how we would deal in this country with the kind of things we’re seeing now.” Mr Johnson was scathing about what he sees as the government’s sluggish response. He said: “I think the government has taken a right path now, eventually.   I think the two week lockdown has given the NHS a fighting chance and I think what we need to do now is not just wait for the vaccine, I think what will happen is that we’ll get better at testing, hopefully we’ll get the protective equipment that the NHS needs, we’ll see that curve flatten out so there is not the overwhelming pressure on the NHS that would have happened had we not taken these measures.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jacob rees moggs investment firm","story":"NewsJacob Rees-Moggs investment firm set to make fortune from the coronavirus crisisEXCLUSIVE: Somerset Capital Management, which the MP co-founded, says market volatility offers a “once or twice in a generation” opportunity to make “super normal s”ShareCommentsByAlan Selby:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video rees-mogg-announces-commons-agenda-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror news politics video highlights-todays-covid-briefing-april-,articleUrl:,thumbnailUrl:https:cf-images.eu-west-.prod.boltdns.net v static  ceed---cd-ec fbec-cfc-fb--aeafc x match image.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics jacob-rees-moggs-investment-firm-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The MP owns at least  per cent of a company investing in businesses hit by falling share values. Somerset Capital Management says investors have a “once in a generation” chance of “super normal s”. Mr Rees-Mogg stood down as a director of SCM to become Leader of the House of Commons. SCM said it was focusing on clients’ long-term security. It came as the UK death toll rose by a record  – including a boy aged five. As millions face financial misery, SCM managers are buying into businesses where valuations have tumbled – but should bounce back. Potential gains of  per cent are touted. Investments so far include private hospitals in Brazil, pharmacies in South Africa and a firm behind a scanning device which checkspeople are wearing masks in China. The revelation was greeted with dismay by new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who said: “Nobody should be seeking to take advantage of this crisis. We should all be asking ourselves what we can do for our country and each other.”Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell added: “This is about as sick as it comes. Profit seeking from suffering is nearly as low as you can get. When we come through this we need a tax on profiteers.” SCM’s strategy comes amid a crisis that has killed , globally, while a further ,, are infected. The UK death toll yesterday rose  to ,. Some , have tested positive. While the economic impact has seen almost a million Brits sign up for Universal Credit, finance houses have been quick to move. Mr Rees-Mogg, , stood down as a director of SCM so he could become Leader of the Commons last July. But he owns at least  per cent, meaning he was entitled to a reported £million share of last year’s £.million profits.Father-of-six Mr Rees-Mogg, who lives in a mansion in Somerset, is reportedly worth more than £million. That could risea plan by SCM’s Emerging Markets Discovery Fund pays off. Fund boss Mark Asquith said in promotional material that investors could capitalise on smaller companies in particular, with prices down up to  per cent. He wrote: “History has shown us that super normal s can be made during this type of environment. Market dislocations of this magnitude happen rarely, perhaps once or twice in a generation, and have historically provided excellent entry points for investors.”  Mr Asquith cited  per cent profits made after the  crisis and suggested “we could see similar moves”. SCM, which has a £.billion portfolio of client funds, is so keen to attract investors it has waived a .% management fee. Giving examples where they hope to profit, Mr Asquith’s co-manager Christopher White identied Hapvida, a Brazilian medical insurance company which also runs hospitals. It has a deal to care for patients in the public health system. Stock has also been bought in Clicks, South Africa’s leading pharmacy. SCM is also invested in Advantech – behind technology rolled out in China to monitor mask wearing and temperatures of people in public places. SCM was co-founded by Mr Rees-Mogg in . His office declined to comment last night.  The firm is managed in part via the tax haven of Singapore. In November the Sunday Mirror revealed SCM traded shares in a firm fined for its role in the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster. It also had holdings of £million in a Russian bank suspected of helping the annexation of Crimea and pro-Putin terrorists in the Ukraine.

The new leader of the opposition is under pressure from many within the party to show a clear departure from the Jeremy Corbyn years as he begins appointing his top team. Starmer, who has promised to recruit a erse team from across the country and party who want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election , is expected to announce the new shadow cabinet today. He has vowed to make it his mission to reconnect the party with the public, saying Labour needs to change so trust can be regained. Sir Keir secured % of the , votes cast in the three-month contest - beating his rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy to replace Jeremy Corbyn. I will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election, he told BBC Oneaposs The Andrew Marr Show. It will be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet. Angela Rayner won the deputy leadership with .% of the vote in the third round, and promised to do everything to re pay  her supportersapos trust. She acknowledged that the party had let down the Jewish community and also had to win back the respect of voters who had left the party to vote Tory. A large clear-out of the current frontbench cohort is widely expected when Sir Keir appoints his shadow cabinet, but some less well-known shadow ministers could be given more prominent roles. Anneliese Dodds and Nick Thomas-Symonds are among those being hotly-tipped for senior positions, while MPs on Sir Keiraposs campaign team could also be in line for jobs. Sir Keir, who entered Parliament in , has said Labour will make the argument for a better future under his leadership - but will first need to restore peopleaposs trust in the party as a force for good and a force for change.  Writing in the Sunday Times, he said: To begin to restore that trust, I will make it my mission to reconnect Labour with the public. I want to build a coalition in all parts of the country, no matter how people previously voted. We must be a party of government again capable of answering to the electorate across the whole of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Never again can Labour be a party that millions of people feel they cannot trust to govern, to manage our economy or to keep our country safe. Make no mistake: our party needs to change so that trust can be regained. We must become a credible government-in-waiting and get back to a position where we can make a real dference to peopleaposs lives. Where that requires us to rethink, we will. And where that requires us to apologise, we will.  Sir Keir also reiterated the apology he made to the Jewish community in his acceptance speech, saying Labour has been shamed over the past years by anti-Semitism.Shortly before the result was announced on Saturday morning, Boris Johnson wrote to opposition party leaders inviting them to a coronavirus briefing as he insisted we have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency.LEADER Keir Starmer ,Rebecca Long-Bailey ,Lisa Nandy , DEPUTY LEADER Angela Rayner Rosena Allin-Khan ,Richard Burgon Ian Murray Knocked out in second round with .% Dawn Butler Knocked out in first round with .% For full breakdown of results click here.

Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Cabinet secretary Michael Gove said there is evidence to suggest compliance ies across dferent demographics of the population.He explained: There has been evidence that for some young people, there has been a lower level of compliance. That is why it is important that we reach them appropriately - it may be that some of the messages and some of the channels we have used have not reached some segments of the population. It may be that young people feel that they are less likely to be affected and less likely to be infected.Images posted on Twitter showed crowds of people in London Fields and Battersea Park in the capital, with some seen sunbathing and others on hire bikes.Brockwell Park in south London will be closed on Sunday because so many people had flouted the Governmentaposs social distancing advice, Lambeth Council said. It tweeted: Despite clear advice, over , people spent today in Brockwell Park, many of them sunbathing or in large groups. This is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the actions of a minority now means that, following police advice, Brockwell Park will be closed tomorrow. The council added: We are sorry weaposve had to take this decision. This wouldnapost need to happenpeople followed the clear instructions from the Govt. We are doing this for the wider safety of the public. A minority of people have not followed the guidance - regrettably we have to act. Sussex Police tweeted on Saturday evening: Thank you to everyone that stayed away from beauty spots and beaches today. We know it isnapost easy. We are disappointed that two people will be summonsed to attend court after breaching the Coronavirus Act  by having a BBQ on #Hove beach. In the North East, surfers were pictured on the beach at Tynemouth. Mr Gove urged people to consider the current pressure on the NHS, and to ask themselves: How am I helping in this shared national effort  He added: I know that lockdown is challenging, I know itaposs very dficult, particularly for families with children. But people must at every stage respect these guidelines because that is the only way of making sure we restrict the spread of the disease.  Pleas to adhere to the lockdown are being transmitted nationwide, and Bournemouth pier has been adorned with the message Stay home with just a few people seen making their way along the mostly deserted sands on Saturday. There were similarly sparse scenes in Canon Hill Park in Birmingham, where a few people were pictured out running.  Earlier on Saturday, second homeowners were told to keep away from their holiday properties as police forces warned they would issue fines to anyone making non-essential journeys this weekend. Gloucestershire Police said officers will stop people who look like they may be heading away for a few days. The force said: There has been particular concern among some communities that people who own second homes in the area will be visiting over the Easter holiday, and they may put extra pressure on the local NHS.

Dr Catherine Calderwood, , said her reasons for visiting the house were not legitimate and she is truly sorry for not following advice she gave to others. She had previously told the public: “To help save lives, stay at home.” Police later visited Dr Calderwoodaposs home and issued her with a warning.Scotlandaposs Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said in a statement: Earlier today, local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted. The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone. Dr Calderwood also stressed people should adhere to the restrictions and said it was looking less likely summer holidays will take place this year as they have done previously, the Daily Record reports. Despite facing calls from politicians to stand down, she said she has spoken to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and will continue to focus entirely on her job of advising ministers over the outbreak. Photos of Dr Calderwood and her family near a coastal retreat in Earlsferry were published in The Scottish Sun late on Saturday. Just days earlier, the doctor tweeted a photo of her family at their main residence in Edinburgh as they clapped for the frontline NHS staff working to stop the spread of Covid-. Earlsferry is more than an hour by car from Edinburgh.  In a statement, Dr Calderwood said: I wish to apologise unreservedly for the issue reported in the media today. While there are reasons for what I did, they do not justy it and they were not legitimate reasons to be out of my home. While I and my family followed the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that. I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that.  I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the First Minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job. A Scottish Government spokesman said on Saturday: Since this start of this  epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotlandaposs response. She took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fe as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over. She stayed overnight before ing to Edinburgh. In line with guidance, she stayed within her own household group and observed social distancing with anyone she was in passing in the village. Scotlandaposs Constitution Secretary Mike Russell said there was no doubt Dr Calderwoodaposs visit - which the Scottish Government confirmed was an overnight stay to check on a family home - was ill-advised. He said she would be answerable for her decision when she appears at the daily coronavirus briefing with Nicola Sturgeon later.  He added: Iaposm saying to everybody... do not go out except in the very exceptional circumstances that are listed, think about these things and remember by breaking them you are risking lives. Scottish Police Federation general secretary Calum Steele said policing the pandemic had been made more dficult and stressed checking on a second home is not one of the reasonable excuses providing an exception to emergency coronavirus legislation. He tweeted: In defending the indefensible has the Scottish Government not just thrown the CMO under the bus  Checking on a nd home is not one of the prescribed reasonable excuses. Scottish Labour ’s health spokeswoman, Monica Lennon, said that Calderwood’s position was untenable.  She said her “actions have undermined Scotland’s pandemic response and her own credibility. Unfortunately, it means she cannot and should not continue in her role.” In a joint statement, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the MSP and MP respectively for the area where Dr Calderwood has her second home, said: It is dficult to see how the chief medical officer will be able to carry the important messages about the virus and the lockdownshe has not even followed it herself. They added: If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go. Scotlandaposs national clinical director Jason Leitch said his colleague would not have put people in the area of her holiday home at risk. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: My understanding is that she has worked like the rest of us   on this for weeks now and that family do have a home a little bit away from Edinburgh and they went to check on it. They observed social distancing throughout, so they were very safe. Nobody knows those guidelines better than Catherine and the rest of us.

But he did not hesitate to join , retired NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline. After  years saving lives, Dr Saadu, , lost his own last week at London’s Whittington Hospital after contracting Covid-. The surgeon’s son described his dad as a “living legend”. And that is true of all those putting their lives on the line to tend to the sick and dying. All are living legends. They battle an invisible invader with too little testing of their own health and not enough personal protection equipment to keep them safe. Their willingness to cobble together kit from whatever they can find is inspiring, shaming and humbling in equal measure. Inspiring, because it shows what can be achieved in adversity. Shaming, because, as a rich nation, we should have done more for them. Humbling, because they carry on regardless. Dr Saadu was not the first medic to die of this nasty, creeping disease. And tragically he will not be the last. Behind doctors, nurses and paramedics, a whole army of NHS workers are also toiling round the clock. The hospital porters, cleaners and caterers, the drivers, the volunteers, the maintenance and admin staff. Alongside them are the key workers who keep our nation ticking over in these perilous times – the shelf-stackers and shop assistants, the posties, truckers, delivery drivers, refuse collectors and utility workers. And the , selfless helpers who stepped forward to ensure the old and vulnerable are not forgotten. Thursday, pm, is proving itself a moving moment as a grateful nation unites to honour them. We reach out to each other in the only way social distancing allows – by putting our hands together. The response of our country to this calamity has been truly astounding. Even those twiddling their thumbs at home are doing their bit by staying there.  Astounding, too, is the response from Somerset Capital Management, the investment firm founded by House of Commons lounge lizard Jacob Rees-Mogg. While Britain has all eyes on a multiplying virus, these virulent fatcats can see no further than multiplying pound signs. While millions face being struck down by Covid-, SCM delights in a “once in a generation opportunity” to make millions by cashing in on the crisis. If Mr Rees-Mogg had an iota of honour, he would disown these grubby profiteers. A politician of real integrity would now sever his links with the company altogether. He may be worth millions, but in the coronavirus stakes his value falls far short of a doctor or nurse. It is their skill and dedication we rely on now to save our lives. It is their caring and compassion which will comfort those reaching the end of theirs.

I am living proof that you’re never too old to do anything. Nor is it ever too late to change your le. I was  years old when I discovered yoga. Before that I’d been living a glamorous le as cabin crew for British Airways. Travel was rare and expensive back in those days, you had to be very wealthy to fly on planes, so it was quite amazing. I loved it. But a rubbish rule back then was that, when you got married, you were no longer eligible for the job. I met my husband three years in and we went on to have two children and moved to Scotland as a family. Well, what a lestyle change! I didn’t know anybody and felt quite lonely with two small kids, so I decided to explore what was going on in the local area. There were two things – curling and yoga. Curling to me looked way too much like sweeping up, so I booked onto yoga, having no idea what it was. When the teacher turned up I was in awe. She was in her early s and just looked fantastic. She was so flexible and could do everything with ease and total vitality. I thought, ‘Whatever she’s doing, it works.’ I was exhausted and stressed with the children and the move when I walked in, but when I left I felt so much lighter. I couldn’t stop thinking about how effortless my teacher made it look. I was hooked. My teacher went on to inspire me, but she was very strict. Posture had to be perfect, she discussed anatomy and physiology with us, and we were expected to really know our stuff. She was an incredible teacher. After a year I decided I wanted to be a yoga teacher. In  I started my three-year course, getting stronger with each session. Now, it wasn’t easy.  I genuinely thought I was quite flexible after all these lovely skiing and surfing lessons I’d been lucky enough to have during my time with BA, but I was stf as a board when I started my training course. Now I know that’s been an advantage in my career –I can do it, anyone can. My first class was a complete accident and I wasn’t prepared. My teacher called in sick and asked me to step in. I managed to do it, but realised how dficult it was to explain things. However, after a while, when I saw some people struggling and I managed to help, I completely forgot about myself. Yoga is absolutely the best thing for your mental health, in my opinion. With all the dismal things going on around us, it teaches us to train our minds and focus on things we are grateful for and practise blue-sky thinking – things that we really want to happen. But it’s also a lot better in terms of physical exercise than people may realise. It tones, it helps joints, it strengthens your bones, helps your breathing, helps your heart and rids you of any tension. Whatever your ailment, I have a pose for it! Oryou want to come to a class and just lie on the mat, that’s fine too. It’s important to give our bodies what they need. Nowadays, yoga is very trendy, but back when I started it was known by so few. My classes became so popular that a journalist from The Daily Mirror called me up and invited me in for an interview on this new ‘craze’ back in .  From that the Mirror asked me to do a fitness video. It sold for £. and sales went through the roof! I couldn’t believe it when I was invited on morning telly to teach live yoga. My whole le changed. I’d be getting my shopping and people would say such nice things. They’d ask, ‘How did you do that one ’ and I’d give a live demonstration in the fruit and veg aisle. People are very kind, aren’t they  So I’m always happy to help. After that I went on to make  videos, which have sold millions worldwide. The most popular was The Age Free Body . I do believe that, as long as you go carefully, youthfulness is an attitude. There is no reason why those in their s and s can’t practise yoga. All you’re doing is gently working on your body and training it to a state of perfect health. It’s also judgement-free exercise, because no matter what level you do, it keeps you healthy, so it doesn’t matter what anybody  thinks. As for me, I practise yoga every day for about an hour by myself, and I am very conscious of my diet. I’ve always been fascinated by nutrition. As a war baby, all we thought about was food. Then everything was rationed until I was about aged seven, so food wasn’t consumed greedily, we just hoped we had enough to eat.  I once saw a doctor who explained that so many people on medication could be helped through pure, natural food and I tried it for a week. I’ve never changed my diet in  years. I eat fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, a little cheese, chicken, fish, milk, but skip all junk. No sweets, cakes, puddings, and instead I just eat fresh beautul food. The only sugar I have now is figs. They are rather lovely and I love a couple after dinner. I even swerve birthday cake. I know it sounds awful to say I haven’t had a slice of cake for  years, but it’s true. It’s not depriving myself, I just love my diet and how it makes me feel. I never drink alcohol. I used to have the odd glass of fizz as cabin crew and hated how it made me feel. But I feel great, quite honestly, and touch wood I’ve never been poorly. That’s not to say that diet goes hand in hand with yoga. People shouldn’t feel miserable about their bodies. You can be bigger and flexible. Often those new to exercise feel scared about taking the first step, but I make them realise that no one is perfect.  It’s lovely seeing clients encouraged when the person next to them can now do a pose they could never do. They’re always happy for each other. I love to help people start feeling proud of themselves again. I live in London with my husband and still teach  times a week. My oldest lady is  and she’s been with me for  years. What a lovely le I’ve been able to have all through my hobby. My family have adapted well to my fame. They see ft cut-outs of me in shops next to my DVDs and say, ‘Hello Mum’. If you’ve never tried yoga, you’ll finish your first class feeling like you’re walking on air. It’s never too late to change your le and you never have to slow down.

One mum decided to use the days at home as an opportunity to finally decorate the bathroom she hated in her three-bedroom home in Swinton, Greater Manchester. But there was a catch, her partner challenged her to transform the space for under £.Bargin hunter Clare Dore, , accepted the task and has revealed how she managed to do up the bathroom for just £ during the coronavirus lockdown. The savvy mum-of-three bought everything to decorate the room from BM Bargains before social isolation orders came into force earlier this month - painting the walls and tiles and even using gold marker pen to spruce up the grouting.Her partner Tony, , was gobsmacked when he saw the final result. And daughters Sienna, , Destiny, four, and two-year-old Avaya all love the new green and gold-themed space too. Clare said: Before my bathroom was  years old and I hated it. I really wanted to revamp it but we had planned to move house in the next year or so, so Tony said it didnapost make sense to spend the money. I challenged him to let me do itI could do it for less of the cost weaposd spend on a family meal out at the weekend - around £ or £. In the end, everything came in at just £ - and Tony couldnapost believe it when he saw it.  She added: I wouldnapost let him see it until it was completely finished and he was gobsmacked. Heaposs not a bargain hunter like I am so he was amazed at how little it had cost to transform. Clare started the decorating by painting the white walls in a deep teal shade, which cost £ for a large tin, before painting the floor in £. white paint. She then used gold spray paint which cost £. to make the silver ider between the wall and the tiles gold and a cheap £ gold permanent marker to go over the grouting.

Despite high visitor numbers to parks and beaches suggesting fatigue may be setting in, Brits have been warned to be ready to hunker down for the long haul, as cases of the deadly bug could keep rising for another two to three weeks. Despite hopes that drastic social distancing measures will soon flatten the curve of the Covid- pandemic, Professor Paul Cosford, Public Health Englandaposs Medical Director, has warned that lockdown measures are nowhere near ending. Other experts, however, such as government adviser Professor Graham Medley of Imperial College London have argued that prolonged periods of lockdown could cause more harm than coronavirus itself, leading to soaring unemployment, food poverty, domestic violence and mental illness. So how long is it likely to last and who will decide when and how to end the restrictions  Follow the latest coronavirus updates here  When will the UK end lockdown  It is not yet clear when the UK will be able to lt its strict social distancing and lockdown measures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to review the measures for the first time next week, however when asked about an exit strategy at the daily press conference on Saturday, Michael Gove said: Thereaposs no fixed point, no specic date in the calendar at which we can say things will change, we are keeping them under review. One key government doctor has said some measures may be in place for up to six months. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, said of the rules last week: Three weeks for review, two or three months to seeweaposve really squashed it, but three to six months, ideally, but lots of uncertainty in that but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal and it is plausible it could go further than that. This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months, but as a nation we have to be really, really responsible and keep doing what weaposre all doing until weaposre sure we can gradually start lting ious interventions which are likely to be spaced - based on the science and our data - until we gradually come back to a normal way of living. What needs to happen before the lockdown can end  Ministers and scientists have been reluctant to say what requirements must be met before they relax the rules and are still emphasising the importance of social distancing. Business Secretary Alok Sharma has warned there could be another rise in casesthe measures are lted too quickly. He told a press conference on Wednesday: Whataposs also really important is thatwe stop these too quickly, there is a possibility that that massive effort people have made across the country is wasted and we could potentially see a dangerous second peak. We absolutely want to avoid that. One scientist has suggested that mobile phone data could help lt social distancing quicker by speeding up contact tracing. Prof Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: A combination of some social distancing measures, extensive testing and automated contact tracing could allow both a more regular social activity and a signicant control of the outbreak.  Who gets to decide when it ends  The decision to end lockdown in the UK will be made by the Government alongside scientists and doctors. When the measures were put in place last month, the Prime Minister said they would be reviewed every three weeks. Top NHS doctor Professor Stephen Powis said scientists are still focusing on learning how the illness works. He said on Saturday: It is very likely that this virus will become established in populations throughout the world and so we need a strategy to manage this over time, not just in the next few weeks or the next few months. Scientic knowledge about this virus is still being discovered. As we learn more about it, as the scientic evidence builds, that will allow those strategies to evolve. Professor Graham Medley, who is advising the government, has told The Times the shutdown is merely buying time and there is no clear exit strategy from the Covid- crisis. He said: This disease is so nasty that we had to suppress it completely. Then weaposve kind of painted ourselves into a corner, because then the question will be, what do we do now  We will have done three weeks of this lockdown, so thereaposs a big decision coming up on April .

Luckily, we love a party here and my parents love fancy dress so there were loads of props in the attic. Joe used to work in a bar so he made the cocktails. I know there are worse things going on in the world than not being able to celebrate your birthday, but I was fuming [when her trip to Belfast had to be abandoned].

Jake Savoie shared his thoughts on Facebook alongside a selfie taken while wearing personal protective equipment at work.He said he did not want to write a similar post, but he could not stay quiet after the stretch of nights that I just had at work. The nurse added: Seeing the amount of people who still aren’t taking this seriously is upsetting. The Facebook post reads: In the weeks leading up to this virus finally reaching our area, I read a lot of articles  viral posts warning me of the physical demands that this outbreak would place on me as an ICU nurse. I mentally prepared myself for the layers upon layers of PPE that I would be wearing, the profuse amount of sweating that I would be doing, etc...however, I was not prepared for the intense emotions that I’d be experiencing. He added coronavirus patients have no normal human interaction in the hospital until they finally test negative. Jake said: The PPE you see in my picture is just a glimpse of what a suspected positive COVID patient sees at all hours of the day night whenever ANYONE is required to enter their room . These patients have no normal human interaction from the moment they step inside the hospital until they are officially declared negative, until the virus has run its course, or until they sadly take their last breath. My heart broke more  more each time that I’d walk into a patient’s room and see the fear in their eyes. Think about this the next time you consider going out because you are tired of your only human interaction being through FaceTime or with those in your household. The nurse added a very dficult part of his job is to tell patients sad news - for example when they have to be placed on a ventilator - especially because medical workers are often the only support people who tested positive for the virus have, since their family cannot be close to them. He wrote: Once again, they receive this frightening news ALONE  their only source of comfort emotional support is from myself, another nurse, physician, respiratory therapist, or CNA dressed in full PPE. One of the most dficult things I’ve ever done as a nurse is tell a grown adult with tears in my eyes that the moment they feared most has come - ...very soon you will see me  a doctor enter your room with even more protective gear to place you on a ventilator, but I will be with you the whole time...just pretend that I’m one of your own children holding your hand.  Sharing the emotional thoughts, Jake also urged people to stay at home in order to fight the spread of the virus. He said: Think about this the next time you decide to invite a group of people over because you’re bored  lonely. These patients aren’t the only ones affected during all of this. Their family members are at home constantly wonderingthey’re safe, taken care of, afraid, comfortable... their hair is brushed the way it usually is... they are sleeping with two pillows the way that they usually do... they have someone to pray with before eating supper like they usually do at home. Their nurses doctors RTs CNAs entire care team are feeling defeated because they want so badly to help but we’ve exhausted all treatment options, medications  ventilator settings. Think about this the next time you decide to ignore elected officials’ warnings advisories because “this is all a political stunt”.  My coworkers  I are exhausted, traumatized, and scared, but we are a team of rockstars  we will push through this public heath crisis. We will fight for our patients every single day no matter the circumstance, but please don’t make it harder for us to fight by going places  gathering with other people when it’s NOT essential to do so. Jake concluded: Stay home, encourage your loved ones to to stay home, hold each other accountable, and pray for everyone on the frontlines of this pandemic. Many people shared their appreciation for the work that Jake and all his fellow medical workers are doing during the pandemic. One person commented: Jake, you and your colleagues are all heroes. Thank you for all that you do. Stay safe for your family. Respect.  Another one said: Your words should be read aloud. They bring home the reality of the situation that you  our other NHS health workers face. Iaposm sad that the human race can be so selfish  humbled by so many wonderful things that are happening during these unprecedented times. One person wrote: This made me cry. One of my best friends is a critical care nurse here in the UK, she’s my personal hero. Thank you for everything you and your colleagues are doing, you are all incredibly strong.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWhen Graham Green bought a DNA testing kit he was hoping to find relatives around Britain to add to his family tree. Instead it revealed a secret that would turn the -year-old grandad’s world upside down. It would show his father had not been a labourer from Hull but an American G.I. who had a fling with his mum and went on to become a D-Day hero. When Graham got the results of his sample from ancestry site MyHeritage saying he had a sister in America he ­assumed there must be a mistake. But when he began chatting to his DNA match Kitty Sala, , the truth about his father started falling into place. Kitty’s dad Harry Atwell Pittmann had been posted to England before the ­D-Day landings in June .  He had been briefly stationed in Graham’s native Hull in the February of that year – exactly nine months before his late mum Elizabeth gave birth. There was another shock for Graham, who has ten siblings. His past had not been such a secret to them. They revealed they’d known for years he was the product of an affair but had not wanted to upset him. In November Graham and we Ros, , travelled to Seattle, Washington, where he had an emotional first meeting with Harry’s family. They greeted him with a sign which read: “Welcome Home Brother”. Graham said: “I was always made to feel part of the family.” The Americans’ reaction had been a great boost to Graham after the emotional upheaval of the test results. He admitted his family tree research had been getting nowhere so he had sent off for the kit. He said: “When I logged in, it showed Kitty was a very high positive result – likely a sister or an aunt. Her two children were also strong matches – they came out as likely to be my nephew and niece. I said to my we, ‘This can’t be right. It’s saying I’ve got relations in the States’.” The shock set in after Graham spent a few days corresponding with Kitty. He said: “It seemed like a bit of a bereavement – thinking you’d lost everything you knew. My feelings were all over the place. “But meeting my American family was overwhelming. MyHeritage had arranged cameras, it was quite a moment. “As I went down the escalator to meet them all, I thought, ‘Woah’. But It was a fantastic meeting.”  Graham, who spent  years in the Army himself, was filled with pride when he was told his dad was a D-Day veteran. Harry was one of thousands of US soldiers who landed on the beaches of Normandy on June  – and saw dozens of his comrades shot before his eyes. Codenamed Operation Overlord, the largest seaborne invasion in history helped turn the tide of the Second World War and allowed the allies to advance into western Europe. By the time Graham was born in the November of that year Harry, then aged , had pushed into Germany – with no inkling he had a son in England. The dad of five, who died of bowel cancer aged  in , never got over what he’d seen on the French beaches. Graham said: “My siblings say he ­remembered the horric situation many of our soldiers went through on D-Day – getting off the beach, having friends shot on landing, or while just getting off the landing craft. “Like many of the guys, he suffered with that memory for the rest of his le. I feel very proud of him. It was quite a poignant moment when we went to the military cemetery where he is buried. “There are lots of similarities between us as we both spent years in the military. He was in the American engineers and I was in the British engineers. I feel sad that I didn’t get to meet my dad. “When you find out things like this, there are all sorts of questions you want to ask. He didn’t know I ­existed – the family sayhe did know, he would have come back. Luckily, I can speak to my brothers and sisters.”  Harry ed to the US when the war ended in  and married shortly afterwards, before having Kitty and her siblings Marsha, , Harry, , Sharon, , and Michael, . All of his children have marvelled at how much Graham looks like their late dad. When Graham probed his own ­family about the secret, they confirmed their labourer dad Arthur spent three years in Myanmar, then known as Burma, during the war. Arthur was posted in the country fighting the Japanese at the time Graham was conceived – meaning he could not have been his ­biological dad. Graham said: “I knew he’d served in the war – I’ve got his medals – but I didn’t give the dates any thought. “He was scarred as well when he came home. I don’t want to forget that. I asked my siblings, ‘Didn’t you even think to tell me ’ They said: ‘What was the point  You were our brother and you were part of the family’.

This is the excitement we’ll miss… In the Euro football tournament, Raheem Sterling would have broken both legs when the England players staged a jousting tournament to relax the day before the first game. But public pressure would have led to Gareth Southgate including him in the squad. Sterling would be in a midfield holding role, wheeled around on a tea trolley by Marcus Rashford. We’d still get to the first knockout stage, but lose on penalties to Portugal, when Harry Kane’s penalty was disallowed because it went to VAR, which decided he was French.  At Glastonbury, in the tradition of headliners being older stars such as Dolly Parton and Paul McCartney, top of the bill would have been the Queen performing a grime version of the national anthem, with guest star Stormzy.She’d surprise the crowd with an improvised chorus: “My crown jewels sparkle, my blood line’s patriarchal, but ma rude boy Harry’s gone wid his b***h Meghan Markle.” The Olympics would have begun with traditional massive anticipation for our big hopes. Then we’d hear the commentator say: “And so, it’s Davidson in lane five, for Great Britain. And they’re away first time and it’s a great start from Davidson, wonderful stride from Davidson, Davidson still running well and as they come to the line it’s DAVIDSON in sixth place, the winner’s some African bloke then a couple of Swedes but WHAT A RUN FROM DAVIDSON.”Eurovision would have been won by a Finnish grunge band called Satanic Death Cult, with their catchy melody I’m Losing it for Lucer. But an appeal would have been lodged after the drummer summonsed the Devil, who took away the Greek judge’s soul for awarding them nil points. My beloved Andy Murray would have worked  hours a day to be fit enough for Wimbledon after his latest hip operation. But he’d have found there was a mistake in his surgery, and he’d been given one of the hips the Queen Mother had removed  years ago but was still lying around.

We went on tour for three weeks to Australia, New Zealand and Tonga etc, and a lot of the time it was just me and her – you have back-to-back engagements, a lot of dferent looks and a full-on schedule, so you become very close in that period. As a hairdresser, you just have a more intimate role, getting someone ready. We made Cali girl hair a bit more formal and had a real laugh.

Just like any other new baby, the little royal was issued a birth certicate with details about when and where he was born, as well as his parentsapos information. All birth certicates are a matter of public record, which means fans got to see it - and it revealed an interesting detail about his mum Meghan Markle. It lists her job description as Princess of the United Kingdom. But this left many fans scratching their heads, wondering why it said princess when Meghanaposs official title is Duchess. While she was given the title the Duchess of Sussex by the Queen on her wedding day, she is also technically a princess, just not in her own name. She is Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales through her husband, Harry. The Duchess of Cambridge also listed princess under the job section part of the form on Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louisaposs birth certicates. Some fans were also surprised to see that the name was listed as Rachel, with many unaware that this is her real name.  But her parents Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland have called her Meghan since birth, and all her of her friends use it rather than Rachel. It was also the name of her popular character in her hit legal drama Suits. Harry is also listed under his real name - Henry - on Archieaposs birth certicate. The document also revealed where Archie was born, despite Meghan and Harry hoping to keep the information private.  The Duchess gave birth at the private Portland Hospital in Westminster - which costs about £,. Portland is a celebrity favourite when it comes to maternity hospitals, with a whole list of A-list patients on the books.

It’s going to be dry with some breeze in central and eastern parts of the country, with the weather becoming warmer in the afternoon. But despite the blue skies and balmy temperatures, Brits are under strict instructions to stay indoors to slow the spread of coronavirus. Officials have been stressing that the blazing sunshine is not a valid reason to head to parks and beaches, and ahead of the weekend, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the nation that lockdown rules are an instruction and not a request.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months. But with the Bonnetis falling out with almost all the centre-halves at Dundee bar one, I was back in.“I got on well with [former Dundee owner] Peter Marr and he liked me as a player so persuaded Ivano to bring me back.“I went back and played about six games towards the end of that season and Berti showed up to watch me put in two man-of-the-match displays.“Next minute I’m called up for Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/Gjen_Dundee_View_edited-140x82.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"lee wilkie neil doncaster ian maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53303150-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53303150-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53303150-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53303150-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"new affordable housing complex for arbroath approved by local authority","story":"A new affordable housing complex is set to be built in Arbroath after Angus Council granted planning permission.Fourteen #affordable# flats will be erected on an area of land at Mayfield Terrace in the town, each of which will be a one-bedroom unit.The application outlined that area of land at Mayfield Terrace is #within the Arbroath Development Boundary and is not allocated or otherwise identied for development#.It is also located within an established residential area and was previously the site of three-storey blocks of flats that were adjoining the row of shops south of the site. vw, px\"  It is proposed that the  flats will comprise of three blocks.Two, which will be located at the north and west of the site, will be made up of two-storey semi-detached blocks, providing four flats in each.The third block will be at the east of the site and will be a two-storey terraced style block that would provide six flats.Fishmonger announces free home deliveries as Arbroath chinese takeaway closes its doors\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp fishmonger-announces-free-home-deliveries-as-arbroath-chinese-takeaway-closes-its-doors embed # secretikfNNjqK\" data-secret\"ikfNNjqK\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The application outlines that #all blocks would have frontages facing out towards Mayfield Terrace and an inner courtyard with washing line enclosure would be provided in the centre of the site#,It is also detailed that #areas of open space would be provided at the sides and rear of the blocks and at the corners of the site#, which would see #nine new larger trees and a number of new shrubs provided throughout the site.# vw, px\"  Space for a total of  cars will also be provided #adjacent to the two semi-detached blocks andA supporting statement said the development would #add to the mix of property sizes in the surrounding area and access arrangements to accommodate the dfering needs in the local community are included in the design#.It was also argued that #the proposed dwellings would provide an acceptableThe flats which were on the land previously, stated in the application to to be  #  Mayfield Terrace, were granted a demolition warrant and were torn down in February .Whilst the site has re-generated in the intervening years to the appearance of an area of grassland, the ground survey supporting information indicates there is potential contamination issues with the land that would be #remediated as part of the proposed development.#In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

within the school.“After a year, I branched off on my own at the age of  and started Scott’s School of Dancing.“I’m teaching kids now who are  and I always wonder how I managed to start a school at that age.“I think my longevity is due to a number of things, like the syllabus I teach, the techniques.“I’ve also stayed in the Bridge of Don for my whole le, so word of mouth helps.“I’m teaching grandkids and kids of people I have teached before which shows that I an very much a family friendly dancing school.”In a bid to make her anniversary show special she is inviting back former pupils to perform in the show, with two flying all the way back from Dubai to take part.They are being taught the moves through Skype and will be ready to go when the show comes to Her Majesty’s Theatre.Sandra

massive amount.“These are aged from  to some of the girls who are older and haven’t danced for  years who are .“A bunch of them are my very first students which is just wonderful to see them come

her favourite dances from through the years, including Cats and Wicked.She will also be performing a monologue about her  years in the business before hopefully doing a dance herself, injuries permitting.She said: “I had my first show at age of  called Lucy’s Dream Comes True and since then have put on a dferent show every two years,“This will be a huge show for me for another reason as well because I got a hip replacement last summer and I would like to do a little dancing in the show.“In the last one I didn’t do any due to my hip being so sore but I always make a surprise

to help others get through the coronavirus lockdown, as well as keeping herself and her family occupied.So far, she has given some tips on anxiety during Covid- using a worry monster to help get rid of worries, shown her moves on a scooter and even created a guide to learning Doric.Maisie, who lives with mum Kelly, , dad Steve,  and brother Cameron, , has been uploading the videos to her channel

I had to come off work early as I’m in the high risk category due to having a heart murmur and asthma, so she came out of school early to minimise risk.“She was bullied in primary one in school, so we got her a wellbeing box which is for children’s mental health. It helps them explain how they’re feeling and we thought it would help with Covid-.“She’s got a worry monster we bought her. You write it down and zip it away in the monster, so she’s spoken about that.“Maisie and I just wanted to help put some things out there for kids who might be feeling a bit anxious at this time.“We hope it helps some of the other kids because Maisie finds it really helps her.”In her video, Maisie gives an overview of her worry monster and how it can help children through this time.She said: “You write it down and put it in his mouth and when it’s night you have to put it in his mouth and he eats it up at night.“You have to check in the morning and seeit’s gone or not but it will be gone.“I’ve got a book called No Worries and its got lots of things in it.”Kelly added: “I’ve got a friend in Australia who works for Barnardo’s and she got in touch and askedthey could use Maisie’s video, so her video is being used there now.”She’s also filmed some light-hearted videos, including doing some arts and crafts, as well as a cookery video which was filmed via FaceTime with family in New York. vw,

words meant while we were filming it, so that’s where she got the idea for the video.“We’re doing the second part of her Doric video and she’s been doing arts and crafts as well.“It’s using the time

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"a83 slip recovery work ongoing","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEssential work to make safe the area of hillside that slipped and blocked the A earlier this yearis forging ahead.Taking care to maintain social distancing and to observe all current NHS and government health advice, a team of experts has been carrying out extensive operations to stabilise the slope and construct a back-up catch-pit.Led by Forestry and Land Scotland, the team includes the geotechnical engineers and consultants involved in resilience works where on the Rest and Be Thankful, and partners Transport Scotland and BEAR.FLS Planning Manager, John Hair, said: #We’re channelling a lot of resources into this and are working on it seven days a week to make this area safe.#Over , tonnes of debris landed on the road back in January. It took a lot of clearing up but that loss of material from the hillside presented other problems as well. We’re currently underpinning a -metre stretch of the forest road to strengthen it and prevent any further major collapse.#The landslip channel has been stabilised but, in the event of future extreme weather events potentially affecting this part of the slope, we are constructing a catch pit that aims to prevent debris from reaching the road surface.#Traffic management will be in place for approximately a further two weeks to allow us to complete the catch pit. We will be working on stabilising the forest road for another four weeks after that but will not require any more traffic management.#Currently only one lane of the carriageway is in use.The area of hillside affected is land that FLS looks after but is well away both from those areas that have slipped in the past and from areas where previous mitigation work has been carried out.Engineering assessments indicate that the incident was the result of exceptionally heavy rain causing a section of hillside above the forest road to slump and block a drainage culvert. This resulted in water damming up, overflowing the forest road and reaching the downhill slope, carrying surface material downhill and also creating a channel for more water to travel down at a faster rate.John, added: #This event arose from a very particular set of circumstances that are unlikely to apply to other sites and situations. However, aware as we are of the increasing occurrence of prolonged spells of heavy rain, we have already reviewed and adapted our inspection process to include checks on other forest roads set in similar landscapes.#We are also developing climate change adaptation actions to make the forests and land more resilient and mitigate such risks.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"helpful advice for students during coronavirus pandemic","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhether it is worry over money, exams, or family and friends – perhaps all three – the COVID- pandemic is a stressful time for students.While many will be at home with their families, and subsequently isolated from their natural peer support, many others will be unable to leave their student accommodation or indeed, in some cases, be unable toto their home country.Student services across the country are going to great s to communicate crucial advice and support, but it is incumbent on us all to help.Through the wonders of digital connectivity, isolation does not have to mean loneliness.Now is a good time to make that phone call, send that text or private message you’ve been meaning to send.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post comments.ldquoThe real challenge will be to ensure likely local residents businesses are aware and can gain access to participate."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-measures-supermarkets-taking-keep-people-safe","story":"Currently, item limit restrictions and priority hours are in place across all major supermarkets

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"keir-starmer-replaces-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader","story":"The current shadow Brexit secretary wasthe favourite to succeedJeremy Corbynafter winning the support of a majority of local constituency parties.He won out over other contenders: shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy.Congratulations to @Keir_Starmer, the new Leader of the Labour Party!#LabourLeadership pic iPjxXaWMfHe said: \"Itrsquos the honour and privilege of my le to be elected as Leader of the Labour Party.\"I will lead this great party into a new era, with confidence and hope, so that when the time comes, we can serve our country again ndash in government.\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said:ldquoKeir will make an outstanding leader of the Labour Party and future Prime Minister.

Apparently her language was so foul the ambassador who reported the scene quickly redacted it.Borthwick is built to withstand siege for months on end, but one night Mary was lowered out of a window on to a horse, and rode through the dark to Dunbar. The castle there was all but impregnable. Arguably the biggest mistake she ever made, some days later, was to leave this safe haven.

How  By learning another language.To be fair, thousands of people in lockdown have figured this out. A lot are dusting down old textbooks or downloading the phone app Duolingo.But can you really learn to speak \"foreign\" without leaving your house  Can your children  Can you or your family refresh or improve existing skills.: How to help your teenagers through lockdownThe short answer is yes ndash thanks to the internet and its incredible resources, especially teachers using Skype, Zoom or other video links.But there are lots of potential pitfalls. Some are specic to the lockdown. And some less so.I have made all the mistakes it is possible to make when learning. So, after taking advice from people smarter than me, here are my top tips for \"lockdown language\".Pick the right language for youFirst, a word of warning. Some people are going to have tremendously strong opinions about what you study. Sometimes they are just enthusiasts for a language or culture, say a passionate Italophile. Thatrsquos great. But remember what works for them might not work for you.Sometimes self-appointed experts focus on what they imagine is right for the country and the economy and not for you. ldquoPah, they will tell you, ldquowhy are you learning Icelandic when there are a billion-zillion Chinese and just a couple of hundred thousand Icelanders This is dumb, really dumb.My tip  Always start with a language that is relevant to you, that you know you will use ndash and therefore not lose.Soyou happen to hike up volcanoes in Iceland every summeror have a boyfriend from Reykjavik or a passion for the sagas, then why not learn to speak like our Atlantic neighbours  Butyou, for instance, do business in Shanghai, practise a bit of kung fu or are fascinated by calligraphy, then maybe think about Chinese.But it really important to \"click\" with the language you are learning. If you canrsquot make up your mind, try out some first, see what fits you.Maybe lug in to some languages before settling on just one. Watch a French or Polish movie or listen to some Italian opera or Brazilian pop, MPB. Try to mimic the sounds.Or take a sampler lesson. You can get one for as little as  an hour online. That takes me to my next top tip.Hire a real teacher or go to real classes ndash online.Remember how you learned the language yoursquore reading now  First your parents ndash probably mostly your mum ndash taught you how to speak. Then at school teachers expanded your vocabulary ndash and with it your world.Learning a language is visceral, itrsquos physical, itrsquos kenetic and itrsquos social. Itrsquos about making unfamiliar sounds with your mouth and recognising them with your ears. You need someone to correct your mistakes as you go along, just as your mum did when you were a baby. You canrsquot teach yourself. Donrsquot waste time trying.I am a big fan of group classes. This is where you learn from your mistakes ndash and those of your peers ndash and you have fun doing so.But this must be impossible when you canrsquot leave the house  Not at all. A number of big providers, private schools, have flipped online using digital tools like Zoom, with the same kit you may be using to stay in touch with friends and family ndash a phone or a laptop.Desperate schools on the European mainland ndash including really prestigious ones ndash are offering a week of intensive lessons, three hours a day in a virtual classroom, with learning materials sent by PDF, for less than the equivalent pound a week. Some are offering three weeks of tuition for  euros.Some Scottish schools, such as Lorca Spanish, are continuing their classes online ndash you canto the classroom when the bug clears.What about private lessons  These are great too, though harder work for learners and teachers. They also tend to be more expensive.However, there are websites such as Italki where language teachers are offering personalised classes for adults and children, often for as little as  an hour with taster lessons for less.:Ron McKays Diary: Lockdown advice, drugs warning and a special anniversaryGillian Campbell-Thow, the languages guru for Glasgow schools, rams this message home: \"Maintaining your oral proficiency is key and you need to talk. End of. If you canrsquot get to your class or meet up group ndash get on a  that you can see people face to face and start the conversation. Many language schools are moving to web-based lessons ndash you cannot beat having a real person to talk to. You wont get that kind of immediate help and support from an app!!Immerse yourself in your chosen languageYour home might be in Scotland ndash but it does not have to be that way.If you are an early learner why not label everything and every room in your house with post-it notes of their name in the language you are trying to pick up.Donrsquot be ashamed to talk to yourself. Vacuuming  Whatrsquos a Hoover in German  Or Urdu  Say it out loud. And not just once.Making dinner  Why not look up a recipe in the language yoursquore learning on YouTube Listening to radio as you cook  Tune in to the country where your language is spoken . Or try some of the amazing content on the catch-up services of the European equivalents of the BBC, including material designed for children or foreigners. France Culture has a whole \"pedagogical series called Nation Apprenante RAI Radio  has Italian classic novels as audiobooks Germanyrsquos Deutsche Welle has free lessons for foreigners at all levels.Binging Netflix or Amazon after dinner  Look at the language settings. You might find your favourite show comes in Spanish or French or Arabic, which subtitles to match. And there are plenty of box sets from around the world to let you put your new or old language skills to test while relaxing on your sofa.Want to socialise  You can do that at home too. Conversation groups ndash meet-ups in cafes and bars for people who want to practise their languages ndash have not shut down, they have just gone online.Yakety Yak, a Scottish business which normally arranges chats in cafes in Glasgow and Edinburgh, says its Zoom events are working well. So much so that it is thinking of continuing them after we get the all-clear.Gaming  PlayStation and other consoles have language controls so you can play in the language you are learning or refreshing.Donrsquot rely on games, apps or other gimmicks ndash but donrsquot ignore them eitherThere are some fantastic new tools for learning foreign languages. But I think they should be seen as supplementing real lessons, not replacing them.It is easy to scoff at games like Duolingo ndash an app with a green bird that has simple beginners lessons with some often surreal vocabulary.Duolingo has proved really popular in Scotland as a way of giving users some familiarity with Gaelic ndash but, of course, no in-depth knowledge. And ndash as a way of relaxing after real lessons ndash it might be worth a try.Podcasts are also no alternative to real teaching. But, my goodness, they can be a great resource. There is a small Scottish firm called Radiolingua which produces short ldquoCoffee Breakpodcast lessons in a whole iety of languages. Check them outyou are a beginner of intermediate learner.Donrsquot think of beginners level as easy and advanced as hardOK, yoursquore stuck in the house and you canrsquot go to a class. So yoursquore tempted to just teach yourself the \"basics\" of your chosen language, because they are easy, right  Wrong!Beginnerrsquos level is where so many Scottish language learners screw up.Itrsquos hard to replicate the sounds of another language. It is worth trying to get it right from the start. Otherwise, to make headway you have to unlearn all the ugly noises you have hard-wired in to your brain when you thought you were rehearsing \"easy\" basics.:Nature reminds us that this lockdown limbo wont last foreverThe good news  Advanced does not mean hard. Learning a language is a marathon, not a sprint. Like a long-distance runners, you will hit walls, but itrsquos not always easy to say when.Focus on talking and listening more than on reading and writingAnother peril of self-teaching ndash or even Scotlandrsquos traditional approach to modern languages ndash is that it ends up becoming very focused on the written word.So, especially,you are a beginner, try to work most on your oral and aural skills, rather than written screeds. Campbell-Thow says: ldquoWriting an essay isnrsquot going to get you what you want in a restaurant or get you out of trouble.This is especially true for your primary-aged kids.Keep a wee wordbookSet yourself a target of learning  words or phrases a day, jotting them down on a notepad and checking yourself every morning. Some people find it helpful to break new vocal in to themes. But keeping going over this book.Campbell-Thow adds: ldquoDonrsquot be frightened to write beside it how it sounds to you.Donrsquot worry about making mistakesThere is nothing wrong with getting something wrong. Just laugh it off. After all, saying accidentally funny things might just be what we all need in these dark times.How to teach your kids a language ndash by Gillian Campbell-ThowThe trick for language learning with wee ones is to remember how children learn their mother tongue ndash they need lots of aural exposure to language and lots of repetition. For primary-age children we need not focus on the reading and writing but lots of talking, listening and intercultural awareness.bull Start with music ndashyou can sing it, you can say it. Use music from films that wee ones might recognise such as nursery rhymes, Disney films etc ndash they already know the tune and now they need to hear a dferent meter of words. Donrsquot overthink the listening, just let them hear it and keep it on a wee loop.bull Get into watching familiar cartoons as well ndash most cartoons will be available in other languages ndash again same context just dferent languages. It doesnrsquot make it so strange.bull Use BBC Class clips for more educational input and intercultural awareness.bull Short clips are great as there is plenty of audio visual stimulus. Try and stay away from the words in the first instance ndash children will use mother tongue pronunciation rules and thatrsquos when mistakes can get embedded.bull Lots and lots of listening, talking and singing ndash so any chance there is to interact, talk and play along with others is great.Gillian Campbell-Thow is curriculum leader for Modern Languages and Gaelic, Glasgow City Council________________________________________________________Shops across Scotland are closing.

If the world hadnrsquot bolted its doors and entered coronavirus lockdown, Fynn Donaldson and more than a dozen pals, fresh from leaving school and with feet still sore from dancing at the end-of-term prom, would be on the beach by day and hitting the clubs by night.ldquoIt should be the summer of her le, says her mum, comedian and writer Jojo Sutherland. ldquoInstead, wersquore at home playing cards and board games.ldquoShe has lost her senior show, the prom, the last day of high school with her friends, her exams. They are all experiences that she will never get back things that Fynn and her friends looked forward to since day one at high school are gone, and thatrsquos hard.Across the Forth from -year-old Fynnrsquos South Queensferry home Eve Gill, , is in lockdown in Cupar, Fe, also trying not to dwell on what should have been.She has trained for a year alongside specially selected teenagers from her school, Bell Baxter High School, for what should have been a le-changing km trek across East Greenland. Instead of heading off earlier this week for the once-in-a-letime Polar Academy adventure, she is stuck inside doing  push-ups a day in an effort to stay fit and trying not to succumb to frustration and negativity.ldquoShersquos been upset and disappointed, says her mum Moy. ldquoTherersquos the anxiety of what is going to happen with her exams too.ldquoTherersquos something about the consolidation and clarity that comes with sharing a year or tworsquos work with someone other than her teachers that is not going to be there.While painting rainbows and watching Disney+ movies might get parents with young children through, lockdown for parents of teens has become a delicate balancing act of avoiding saying the wrong thing ndash impossible at the best of times ndash tiptoeing around unpredictable hormones and fighting over why they mustnrsquot go out to meet their friends.For those trying to stop stroppy older teens used to independence from leaving the house, and others fearful that their youngsters may slide into deep anxiety, stress and even depression, the added pressure of the current crisis means the stakes are even higher.The stress and anxiety of coronavirus, cancelled proms, scrapped exams and separation from friends comes against a backdrop of heart-breaking statistics that show young peoplersquos mental health is more fragile than ever.Last year, more than , young Scots needed mental health treatment from the countryrsquos  health boards: a rise of almost  since . Worryingly, more than  children and young people waited over a year to receive support through from health board mental health services.It means that for parents of teens, it is going to take a bit more effort than a Joe Wicksrsquos am workout and baking a Betty Crocker cake to get through whatrsquos ahead.At home in the shadow of the Forth Bridges, Jojorsquos daughter Fynn should have been preparing for five Highers, hoping for the right grades to study politics and international relations at either Dundee, Stirling or Aberdeen University.ldquoFynn has been emotionally down in terms of looking at the things shersquos not now going to experience, says Jojo.ldquoShe plays volleyball for Scotland and had been looking forward to going the European Championships in Iceland in June. She normally trains three or four times a week physically, shersquos like a caged animal.ldquoOne advantage is that her generation communicates online anyway. Theyrsquore doing stupid dances and messaging each other just like before and she still feels connected to her mates.Unlike smaller children who may not fully grasp the seriousness of the situation, she points out that older children canrsquot be easily distracted or fobbed off.ldquoYou canrsquot bullsh** teenagers and say everything is going to be fine. They read the papers and see the news and know whatrsquos going on.ldquoShe seems okay, but I worry because mental health problems, depression and anxiety are much more prevalent among teenagers these days.According to parenting expert Laura Erskine of The BabyDoc Club, guiding teens through this crisis needs a particularly delicate touch. ldquoThey are looking at news and social media, they are glued to their screens in their rooms and they know whatrsquos happening.ldquoWe need to get them out of their bedrooms, into a family space and find new ways to do things with them.Talking to them directly about their feelings could backfire, she warns.ldquoTeenagers donrsquot want to sit down and talk about stuff thatrsquos worrying them with their parents. They want their peer group.ldquoInstead of asking them straight about their feelings, ask about their friends or say start a conversation by saying yoursquore aware someone you know has a son or daughter thatrsquos struggling a little.ldquoTeenagers are very self-centred and believe the whole world revolves around them. But their feelings and worries are all valid.For parents of older teens, therersquos the challenge of trying to prevent headstrong young adults from wandering out to secretly meet friends.Jojo, who has three other older children, says: ldquoFynnrsquos been good, but I think a few kids in the area have been a bit naughty. Itrsquos going to happen.ldquoBut her attitude iseveryone studiously stays at home, this will pass quicker.Although they donrsquot know each other, both Fynn and Eve are taking a pragmatic approach to lockdown.Fynn hasnrsquot yet completely written off the possibility of a summer break with her pals Eve, who was due to sit seven National s, is focusing on next April when Polar Academy adventure with nine other students from her school is now due to take place.ldquoI was gutted that it was postponed, she says. ldquoBut Irsquove come to terms with it now.ldquoWersquore all being positive for each other.Case study: Le with the WilsonsCharlene Wilson, a press officer from Clackmannanshire, has teenage daughters, Cha, , and Megan, .ldquoOur girls are finding things quite tough, she says. ldquoTheyrsquore at a challenging age with their hormones affecting their emotions and are mostly struggling with not being unable to socialise.ldquoThey do chat on WhatsApp and Zoom but itrsquos not the same as having that human interaction.The prospect of missing birthday treats next month, not being able to see grandparents and family, and fears their plans to see Lewis Capaldi at Trnsmt may be scuppered, have been hard.ldquoIrsquom missing seeing my friends and even missing seeing my teachersIrsquom honest, says Cha. ldquoI feel very cut off from people which isnrsquot nice.ldquoWe are hearing the news every day about coronavirus and how more and more people are affected and dying, so that is quite upsetting.Sister Megan is also finding lockdown hard. ldquoI mainly miss seeing my friends.

What wersquove been seeing in Italy and Spain and, more recently in New York, is unfolding right on our own doorstep. We knew it would, but still the realisation that this is happening here is really quite mind-numbing.Only a couple of weeks ago there were positive things we felt able to grasp at. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Cabinet team were resolute and confident when they spoke of preparation, of learning from other countries and of ldquogetting through this with a unity of spirit and co-operation.It was perhaps too easy then to be too confident that wersquod get off lightly compared to others. It is perhaps too easy now to become too worried that everything is teetering on the edge of collapse.Even the BBC headlines canrsquot help themselves from being tabloid.

They are three times more likely to experience a chronic health condition such as asthma and COPD.#As the weeks and months continue, we know that the increasing pressures on the economy, and people losing their jobs could mean a rise in people being forced into homelessness too.Scotland has long been a world leader in its approach to tackling homelessness and it is good to see the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to giving people somewhere safe to live at such a time. But, while itrsquos absolutely right that everyone has been supported into hotels, it is important to remember that this is a necessary emergency response to the pandemic ndash itrsquos not a long-term solution.The speed at which people have been housed should give us much hope that homelessness can absolutely be ended. In a matter of weeks, everyone who needs somewhere to live ndash including those with no recourse to public funds ndash have been given self-contained accommodation, and they have access to healthcare, food and the extra support they need.This makes the case loud and clear that there is no need for people to be sleeping on our streets.The people we speak to living in hotels tell us theyrsquore grateful for being able to have a proper bed, soap and access to three meals a day, but the fear among some is abundantly clear. With no end in sight at the moment to this current crisis, the lack of information as to how long people will be able to stay in their rooms is understandably concerning.One major concern is what will happen to those people who are homeless and have no recourse to public funds because of their immigration status. It is great that they now have self-contained accommodation ndash but therersquos still a huge need for extra support to be put in place, such as providing information about the pandemic and what it means in their own language, or translators being made available.As the barriers that were once in place to finding someone a safe and settled home ndash like low levels of housing benefit ndash are being lted in light of the outbreak we are seeing more options open up. Frontline staff at Crisis are noticing increasingly numbers of affordable properties in Edinburgh, meaning that we have more opportunities to move people into safe, stable housing. We must not see these obstacles reinstated ndash the Scottish Government must work with Westminster to ensure that when the pandemic subsides, we are left with a proper welfare safety net.It shouldnrsquot have taken a pandemic to prove we can end rough sleeping across Great Britain ndash and we shouldnrsquot use the end of the crisis, when it comes, as an excuse to go backwards.Grant Campbell is director of Crisis Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"scots-scientists-join-international-effort-revive-africas-superfoods","story":"For generations of Africans, they were the ldquobare necessities ndash small crops of odd-shaped, strange-tasting fruit and vegetables such as prickly pears, edible roots, leaves and seeds provided nutritional sustenance and played a vital role in their diet.But as Western influences emerged, precious native crops like bitter yam, sweet bush mango, chocolate berries and horned melon were overtaken by belly-filling maize, wheat and rice.Now scientists from Scotlandrsquos Rural College are among an international team looking at ways tolargely forgotten ldquosuperfood crops to African tables, in an effort to help offset deeply worrying levels of malnutrition across the continent.More than  under-utilised plant species ndash known as ldquoorphan crops because they have been largely forgotten in the race towards fields of starchy wheat, rice and maize ndash have been included in the programme.Researchers will look at ways of using genomics to enhance their production and harvesting to encourage food producers, while new marketing techniques to make crops appear ldquocool will be introduced to encourage consumers to take advantage of their exceptional nutritional values.As well as helping to improve nutrition, the programme could help strengthen food production in the face of climate change and population growth: Africarsquos population is predicted to double to . billion people in  years, raising pressure on governments to deliver more food and better livelihoods.It could also lead to a wave of African ldquosuperfoods with exotic flavours and unusual textures being exported to Western markets.Dr Ian Dawson of SRUC, who is part of the African Orphan Crops Consortiumproject, said the crops were ldquoculturally important but had been displaced by alien crops such as maize, rice and wheat, introduced by Western influences.ldquoWheat and maize, for example, are very good at providing energy and have lots of starch, he said. ldquoBut theyrsquore not very good at providing the other range of nutrients that we need for a healthy diet.He added that farmers had often turned away from growing ldquoorphan crops despite their immense nutritional value, to meet rising demand for wheat, maize and rice.ldquoProduction of these culturally important crops has decreased or become restricted.ldquoIn some cases, the lsquoorphanrsquo crops are not regarded as particularly profitable to grow, while a move to a more Western diet, increased urbanisation and people eating more processed foods which are unhealthy but based on staples, has also had an impact on their production.ldquoThe project came from a recognition that there was a need to focus more on nutritional value and, in particular, producing better crops that farmers can grow.Malnutrition, or ldquohidden hunger, in many African nations, is linked to human underdevelopment, causing stunted growth among children, anaemia and obesity.Unicefrsquos  report, The State of the Worldrsquos Children, singled out South Africa in particular as facing a burden of malnutrition, under-nutrition, hidden hunger and obesity.It added that a lack of quality food put children at risk of poor brain development, weak learning, low immunity, increased infections and death.The plants chosen for the project are mostly indigenous to Africa. However, some ndash such as the tellingly-named elephant ears which originated in South America ndash are considered ldquoexotics.Elephant ears plants are popular in Puerto Rican cuisine, typically ground with squash, potato, green bananas and plantains, and mixed with pork and ham before being boiled in a banana leaf.Some plants included in the programme have recognisable names but have suffered from a lack of research into their nutritional qualities which could make them more attractive to farmers and consumers.They include tamarind, a large evergreen tree which produces sticky edible seeds similar to dates jujube, which produce crisp, juicy fruit rich in fibre and vitamin C and sour plums which, despite their tart taste, have a high potassium and protein content.Dawson said genetic enhancement of the crops included in the AOCC programme could help revive interest in the plants among Africarsquos largely female farming communities, who have particular interest in ensuring their families receive a quality, nutritional diet.ldquoCertain crops may not be very profitable ndash they might be hard to produce and there could be a lot of labour costs. Altering a plantrsquos architecture so it doesnrsquot fall over in the field or ensuring the seed or crop remains on the plant and doesnrsquot fall on the ground can make it easier to pick.ldquoMaking the fruit bigger can also make it easier to harvest, he added.ldquoOther genetics could enhance the processability of the crop so itrsquos easier to cook or easier to extract the seed from the plant so it can be incorporated into processed foods.He added: ldquoThere is an export market for some of these crops in a way that quinoa was a South American orphan crop and has now become popular in the UK.ldquoHowever, the risk is that nothing is left for the local people. So therersquos a need not to export all the good stuff.First, however, a major element of the SRUC input into the project is aimed at encouraging farmers and food producers to sht focus from Westernised diets to accept the traditional crops.That may require very Western-style marketing campaigns. ldquoTo have an impact and get crops to farmersrsquo fields, we need to do the genetic stuff but also promote the crops so we get consumers interested in eating them.ldquoOne way is to make these crops look really aspirational and lsquocoolrsquo, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"need-better-system-food-banks-says-pete-ritchie-nourish-scotland","story":"One of the first lessons wersquove had to learn in this crisis is that running out of food is not a problem of supply. Itrsquos a problem of distribution. poundbn worth of food that should be on the shelves is in peoplersquos cupboards and fridges, and too much of this will end up being wasted.Meanwhile, food banks up and down the country view the lockdown announcement with alarm. Will thevolunteers be allowed to leave their home to work in them  Will they get supplies from public donations or be able to buy them from the supermarket  Will they be allowed to stay open Therersquos no doubting the good intentions of the people who run and work in food banks. They have been picking up the pieces of ten years of austerity. But now, enough is enough.Itrsquos completely possible to give people money to buy food themselvesthey have run out of cash. In Scotland, itrsquos called the Scottish Welfare Fund, and itrsquos just been doubled by the Scottish Government. Itrsquos perfectly possible to issue people with a card to use in shops which the Government then loads with money. In Scotland itrsquos called Best Start Foods. Itrsquos perfectly possible in the short term for GPs, schools and welfare agencies to hand out supermarket voucherspeople need them.We have an amazing food distribution system. Cunningly, shops have been located near where people live, and most of them deliver. They are open much of the time. Letrsquos provide ordinary, dignied access to the food distribution system that everyone uses when they can afford it.Making food banks inessential takes a little money, sure. To cover the cost of the food given out each year by Scotlandrsquos foodbanks would be around pound-m ndash % of the poundm investment in tackling poverty announced last week by the Scottish Government.To raise the incomes of the poorest % of the population of the UK by pound per week and make a real dent on food insecurity would cost poundbn ndash % of the rescue package announced last week by the UK government.And it needs a little work to imagine a Scotland without foodbanksndash but rather less than imagining a national lockdown, a ban on weddings, rail renationalisation, no football, no church.Wersquove discovered that we genuinely are all in this together this time.

We are all enlisted now."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-stalks-worlds-poorest","story":"Just for a moment pause and consider these glaring global insights from a few of the countries and communities least equipped to tackle the onslaught of coronavirus. Mali in West Africa, for example, has three ventilators per million people. In Zambia, there is one doctor for approximately , people. In Pakistan health spending per head is one two-hundredth the level in the United States, one of the richest countries in the world which itself is struggling to cope with the effects of the virus.:Coronavirus: the decade-old warnings left unheeded by Scottish ministersConsider, too, that currently itrsquos estimated that more than . billion people worldwide live in substandard housing. Of those, at least  million have no home at all.Then there are the  million displaced people worldwide. Among them are the Rohingya in camps on Bangladeshrsquos border with Myanmar and hundreds of thousands of Syrians escaping Idlib province crammed up against the border barrier with Turkey.For many of these people, social distancing is a near impossibility as is regular hand-washing in places often already unsanitary and without clean running water.As statistics go,these are not enough to send a chill down the spine then I donrsquot know what is. I do know that to talk of the world right now feels tough in these times. We are all intimately feeling the pain in one shape or form from the impact of coronavirus.But to ignore what is unfolding where, in far-flung parts of the world, is to do so at our peril.As former president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who beat Ebola in Liberia, put it recently: ldquoCoronavirus anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.While a truism in itself,one other thing is certain in these uncertain times, itrsquos how history has shown us that pandemics hit the poorest hardest.The Spanish flu of   is said to have wiped out % of Indiarsquos population, the vast majority among the countryrsquos poorest and most vulnerable. More recently, most people who died of Aids were African, those from a continent where swathes of the population exist on or below the subsistence level and where healthcare provision is often sparse to say the least.Just last month, Bill Gates, the American business magnate and philanthropist, warned that the pandemic could kill  million Africansit were allowed to rip through the continent. Just now it is wealthy countries that are the epicentre of this deadly virus, but as Jose MariaVera, interim executive director of Oxfam International, ominously observed the other day, already Covid- has started to ldquoprey through the colossal cracks that ide our world.So just what are the implications for the worldrsquos poorest and most vulnerable as the pandemic takes grip within their countries and communities  What must be done to assist in militating against its worst ravages :Scotlands chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood spotted flouting coronavirus lockdown rules in visit to second homeAs Abiy Ahmed, the  Nobel Peace Prize laureate and prime minister of Ethiopia, rightly pointed out in the Financial Times last week,Covid- is not controlled in Africa and other parts of the developing world then it ldquowould quickly bounce back on the rest of the world.Many of the worldrsquos neighbourhoods the pandemic now threatens are the last stop.These are places where a person canrsquot fall any further short of being totally destitute or dead. In many years of covering the world as a reporter, Irsquove seen first hand the struggle to survive in these places of near unimaginable squalor and poverty.Places like the slums of Kibera, Mathare and Korogocho in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, which are among some of the biggest in Africa.In fact, itrsquos estimated that % of Nairobirsquos entire population ndash some . million people ndash are slum dwellers, many living up to  to a single room in little more than a corrugated steel shack.In the Korogocho slum in the city, countless people survive by scavenging the gigantic and infamous Dandora illegal dumpsite. There, thousands of tonnes of waste are heaped daily from across the city, including the unfinished food from the flights arriving at Nairobirsquos international airport, where almost all the coronavirus cases gained entry into Kenya.But those slum dwellers in Africa are far from alone in the teeming cheek-by-jowl existence and wretchedness that blights their lives.Far from Africa on the Caribbean island of Haiti, the poorest country in the western hemisphere and barely a few hours flying time from Miami and New York, people in slums like Cite Soleil likewise live one on top of another in an indescribably filthy warren of alleyways and concrete boxes.During one visit, just after the devastating  earthquake that has since made the situation worse, I was told how , people crammed into a single kilometre in parts of Cite Soleil. So congested was it that ldquosht sleepingrsquorsquo was common, and families would bed down on a rota basis, four hours inside and four hours in the alleyways outside. In such communities the arrival of coronavirus is a near death sentence.For both slum dwellers and often refugees alike, population density is perhaps the first in a series of factors that makes them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus. In the case of refugees, multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom, and the same cooking and bathing facilities,they have access at all.Second, both groups generally have dficulty accessing basic services, especially healthcare. Third, the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will also complicate efforts to respond. Misinformation, mistrust of authorities, the absence of communication networks, and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging among those living in urban slums and refugees in informal camps.ldquoWithout critical information about coronavirus, the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection, but find themselves in violation of new policies, warned the humanitarian agency Refugees International in a newly published report addressing the threat posed by Covid- to already existing emergencies involving displaced people across the globe.ldquoAt risk of deportation, asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities, much less reveal themselves once they get sick, the report highlighted.For aid agencies the challenges are immense as their humanitarian supply chain may be broken by the outbreak and aid workers perhaps have to reduce or cut contact with communities to help prevent spread of the virus. Many humanitarian agencies also warn that they will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis.All this, too, before the role of politics in impacting on the most vulnerable, as national governments often restrict the movement of international personnel and supplies or close borders. Aid agencies fear a looming disaster both for slum dwellers and those refugees and migrants in informal camps.ldquoWhen the virus hits overcrowded settlements in places like Iran, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Greece, the consequences will be devastating, Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, warned last week. ldquoThere will also be carnage when the virus reaches parts of Syria, Yemen and Venezuela, where hospitals have been demolished and health systems have collapsed.Such challenges for aid agencies and the poorest are only made worse, of course, in those countries where the political leadership is scathing of the threat prosed by the pandemic.In Brazil, for example, president Jair Bolsonaro has dismissed the coronavirus as nothing more than the ldquosnfles and criticised regional lockdown measures.Such is the anger with Bolsonarorsquos response that recently many of those living in Brazilrsquos low-income favelas or unregulated slums in major cities took part in a \"aco\", a protest that involves banging pots together outside a window and screaming insults such as ldquoBolsonaro, out! and ldquoBolsonaro Assassin!.:Highland police forced to add extra patrols amid plans for public COVID- marchStepping into the breach, meanwhile, in the absence of a considered and concerted response by Bolsonarorsquos government, Brazilrsquos drug gangs and paramilitary groups began enforcing social distancing to combat the spread of coronavirus. Just these past weeks, as the Covid- death toll has climbed, gang members have been circulating in the Cidade de Deus ndash City of God ndash favela in western Rio ordering residents to remain indoors after pm.The community, made famous by Fernando Meirelles  movie blockbuster City Of God, was among the first to record a case of coronavirus.ldquoWhoever is caught on the street will learn how to respect the measure. We want the best for the population. If the government is unable to manage, organised crime resolves, read one message circulated by WhatsApp to residents of one Rio slum.But exceptionally bizarre responses such as this aside, it remains national government and help from the international community that most of the worldrsquos poorest communities will depend on in their bitter struggle with the pandemic.Time now is of the essence. Africa has reached a ldquobreak the glass moment, an emergency in which international actors need to take drastic actionthe worldrsquos poorest continent is to avoid a human and economic catastrophe, Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghanarsquos finance minister, told the Financial Times last week.The problem is that so many places are now facing their own ldquobreak the glass emergency moment with potentially nightmarish economic consequences.More than % of the worldrsquos poorest countries ndash and half of those active in international bond markets ndash were already in or at high risk of debt distress before the crisis hit.Some  countries have already approached the International Monetary Fundfor short-term emergency assistance in recent weeks, around double the number that called on the fund in the immediate aftermath of the  financial crisis.As many humanitarian agencies also point out, many responses will have very specic needs that require a strategy tailored to the circumstances of the population in question. As the recent Refugees International report has made clear, however, there are common elements across countries and continents that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.Among those identied include ensuring that the response must be inclusive, reaching all vulnerable populations, including slum dwellers, refugees, asylum seekers, and the internally displaced.It will need to enhance communication and flow of information, deploy medical personnel and protective clothing, improve access to water and hygiene, and focus on isolation and quarantine capacities as well as testing for the virus.If there are positives in all of this one of them is that the population of poor countries are predominately young with a median age of , in theory making many physically more resilient. But offset this against hunger, and already existing ill health, and it is of little comfort.On a more constructive note, especially in Africa, many lessons have been learned from fighting Ebola, but coronavirus is an altogether dferent proposition in terms of infection rate and spread. The bottom line is that any response will be incredibly challenging and problematic for the international community and those organisations tasked with helping those most in need, not least as governments globally look to their domestic needs and demands during the crisis.But it is precisely the scale and speed of the pandemic that has underscored how deeply interconnected the worldrsquos populations are.Across the globe, the poorest and most vulnerable have sometimes been regarded as a sea of lost souls, their lives ignored, hidden from sight or forgotten. The coronavirus pandemic has reminded us all of the dangers in such blindness, as well as the moral imperative that exists to assist those most in need in overcoming the onslaught they now face.Former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is right. Coronavirus anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.________________________________________________________Shops across Scotland are closing. Newspaper sales are falling.

There have been concerns around jobs and safety.The organisers of the petition are seeking to halt the plans and are asking for an independent assessment of the decisions and decision-making process around the project to be carried out.A number of MSP#s have stood in opposition to the plans, including Orkney#s Liam McArthur and Shetland#s Beatrice Wishart.Mr McArthur said: “I have been raising concerns about HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic services for some time now. No-one disputes the need to modernise the way in which these services are delivered, but even HIAL’s own consultants identied the ‘remote tower’ option as the most risky and costly.“The estimated costs of the project appear to fall far short of what will realistically be neededit is to have any chance of being delivered successfully. At the same time, staff have made clear the lack of proper consultation and the intention of many to leave the organisation. If that happens, our leline air services will be at risk of serious disruption.“After the members debate earlier this year, led by my Shetland colleague, Beatrice Wishart, the petition will give parliament a further opportunity to consider this issue. These proposals will have a profound effect on our island communities, so it is right that MSPs, particularly those representing the Highlands and Islands, have the chance to hold HIAL and Scottish Ministers robustly to account”.The petition can be found here.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Calderwood attended Methodist College in Belfast. In a statement released on Sunday morning, she said: I wish to apologise unreservedly for the issue reported in the media today.While there are reasons for what I did, they do not justy it and they were not legitimate reasons to be out of my home.While I and my family follow the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving others, and I am truly sorry for that. I know how important this advice is and I do want my mistake to distract from that. I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to Ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the First Minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job.It has since emerged that police have visited Dr Calderwood and issued her with a warning.Scotland#s Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said in a statement: Earlier today, local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted. The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone.Just days earlier, the -year-old doctor tweeted a photo of her family from their main residence in Edinburgh as they clapped for the frontline NHS staff working to stop the spread of Covid-. The paper says the home in the capital is just two-and-a-half miles from the Scottish Government building where Dr Calderwood delivers daily briefings on the virus with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Earlsferry is a drive of more than an hour from Edinburgh. The images emerged amid continuing advice from the CMO and other leading medical professionals and politicians to stay at home in order to save lives and protect the NHS. Last month, the Scottish Government issued a travel warning criticising the irresponsible behaviour of people with second homes and campervans travelling to the Highlands in a bid to isolate. On Friday, the Scottish First Minister said the upcoming Easter break would be a holiday period unlike any we#ve had in our letimes. Dr Calderwood also stressed people should adhere to the restrictions, and said it was looking less likely summer holidays will take place this year as they have done previously. Dr Calderwood#s colleague, Scotland#s National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said nobody knows the social distancing guidelines better than her and she would not have put people in the area of her holiday home at risk. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: My understanding is that she has worked like the rest of us   on this for weeks now and that family do have a home a little bit away from Edinburgh and they went to check on it. They observed social distancing throughout, so they were very safe. Nobody knows those guidelines better than Catherine and the rest of us. So I#m confident that she was safe during that, her family were safe and those around them were safe. A Scottish Government spokesman said on Saturday: Since this start of this epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotland#s response. She took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fe as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over. She stayed overnight before ing to Edinburgh. In line with guidance, she stayed within her own household group and observed social distancing with anyone she was in passing in the village.Nicola Sturgeon said: The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so it was wrong and she knows that. She added: All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in. When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it. She said the CMO is learning from her error, and added: Over the past few weeks, as we have been dealing with this crisis, her advice and expertise has been invaluable to me. She added that not withstanding her mistake on this, she is doing extremely well. Dr Calderwood said she was also at her second home last weekend with her husband.Belfast Most ReadPictured: Thieves make off with clothes after ram-raiding Belfast city centre shopFormer Belfastjournalist Betty McCaw passes away after contracting Covid-Belfast born chief medical officer apologises after being pictured visiting second home during coronavirus lockdownPSNI plea for public to stay at home after early morning car crashPolice attend security alert at Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan#s Belfast office,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Minister also emphasised that every conceivable effort is being made to improve both situations. “I can assure staff and the wider public that these two issues are receiving absolute priority. It’s no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites. “Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly. googletag.cmd.push “This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs. “I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that. “However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Swann stressed:“I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.” Turning to PPE, the Minister said:“Our health service has signicant levels of PPE in stock at present but need to boost these quantities given the expected level of demand in coming weeks. Our PPE supplies have been supported through release of % of the emergency pandemic stockpile as announced last week – in the region of  million items. “Updated UK-wide NHS guidance on PPE use has been issued. This guidance will inform PPE use across our system and help us to prioritise distribution. “I fully understand that staff on the frontline need reassurance. I believe the updated guidance and securing greater quantities of PPE for Northern Ireland will both play a part in allaying concerns. “I want to make absolutely clear that the PPE guidance is about ensuring staff have the appropriate level of protection for the circumstances they are working in – it is absolutely not, nor will it ever be, about seeking to restrict the use of equipment.” He continued:“The situation with PPE supply has been made more challenging by the fact that supply routes from China, a leading global provider, were closed until recently. “I am actively working with the Finance Minister to pursue all feasible supply routes, both international and local. “I recognise that other NI Departments are also facing PPE challenges. We have to tackle this together across the Executive and also to appreciate the scale of global competition for PPE products. The Minister added:“It would be facile for anyone to suggest that there has been any lack of urgency. We are doing everything we can to best of our ability to make things better. “Our health service has been under consider financial pressure for the past  years. That has inevitably had a bearing on its capacity. I cannot undo that, but I will work night and day for the sake of the public and our great health and social care staff. Colleagues right across the system at all levels are doing the same.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There certainly should be a coordinated approach North and South but there are actions Stormont Executive parties and the Dail have not been willing to act on when it comes to PPE, Covid- test kits and ventilators. They havent been willing to put public health ahead of private companies raking in massive profits in the midst of this crisis. This is why their response has been slow, inadequate and putting lives at risk. googletag.cmd.push When the WHO declared Covid- a global pandemic on January  manufacturers should have been directed by Westminster, Stormont and the Dail to repurpose production to mass produce PPE. This didnt happen and now were scrambling to get them from China. It can still happen. For testing of Covid- and mass testing, Randox Laboratories in Crumlin, Antrim, should be put under public control. Randox has received tens of millions in public money but have be allowed to go on a profiteering binge. Instead of being directed to mass produce testing kits as part of an integrated all-Ireland health strategy theyve been able to charge exorbitant prices. Prince Charles, Boris Johnson and elites get tested while workers and the sick dont. Put Randox under public control now. googletag.cmd.push Randox pays Tory MP Owen Patterson pound, a year and have been allowed to put profits for shareholders ahead of people and profit. The rich and powerful shouldnt have access to testing when frontline workers cant. Thirdly, Medtronic based in Galway, is a global manufacturer of le-saving ventilators. Medtronic should also be put under public control to produce thousands of ventilators for health services North and South. Business cant go on as usual in response to this crisis. Private companies cant be allowed to put profiteering ahead of people and health. These are actions that should be taken but the political establishment, so long subservient to powerful corporations, wont contemplate them unless they come under pressure to do so.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

The new system will be operational from Monday next, April , to assist in dealing with increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse that has been accumulated as a result of the current emergency situation. Karen Phillips, Director for Environment and Regeneration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told councillors yesterday that the new service would include a dedicated helpline that would be manned, Monday to Friday from am to pm, with a team of staff to process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls would be fed into a central system, that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. It was outlined to members that only excess residual, green and garden waste would be collected, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections would be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with Council, with no kerbside waste being permitted. It was reiterated to members that this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and the public will be strongly advised that they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. googletag.cmd.push The council said they will continue to put a strong emphasis on the recycling message, re-enforcing the need for the public to continue to maximise the use of their blue and brown bins. It is hoped that this additional service will assist in providing support to vulnerable members of the community and those with specic issues with medical or additional residual waste, such as larger families and will prevent fly-tipping. She reassured members that refuse collection staff providing this service would be adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and health and safety measures. She said checks to identy members of the public who are self-isolating would be done by staff prior to the collection being arranged. Members were informed that messaging and advice on double bagging also be communicated to those availing of the service, adding that the council would review the service on a daily basis and had the capacity to put additional resources in place according to demand. It was also outlined to members that the new service, while being operational from next week, would take a number of days to roll out and the public would be encouraged to be patient and co-operate with council during this process.

They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy.

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus.

Dr McBride is not only CMO, he has directly relevant experience of infections, having become a consultant specialist in one of the worst pandemics, HIV, almost  years ago. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Other experts include Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association GP committee in NI, who has for weeks calmly stated that the UK has some of the world’s best scientists, that the advice is good and should be followed.When I tweeted recently about the UK’s outstanding scientic leaders, some people wonderedit was a sleight on the Irish experts. Yet I assume that the Republic has similar numbers pro rata of brilliant medical and scientic people to the UK, but the latter has almost  times more people and  times more experts.Republicans haveaccused unionists of slavishly following British advice, when almost the opposite has happened: all the key figures in Northern Ireland’s response to the crisis support close co-operation with the Republic, as makes sense on an island, while republicans have obsessively promoted all-island responses, and trashed the overall UK approach.The party wants a severe lockdown, closing manufacturers such as Ulster Carpets who say they are practising safe social distancing for employees, yet it delayed on granting powers to the PSNI . NI was the last place in the UK to clary what police could do.Ms O’Neill is implying that the WHO and UK have an utterly erging approach, when in fact they have largely the same approach with some dferences.It is not unreasonable for the deputy first minister, without expertise, to think that one group of scientists is right and another wrong. Lord Sumption, the ex Supreme Court judgewho said the UK Covid- response was hysterical , pointed out that we are not ruled by scientists. We apply our own critical faculties to advice he said.But what a coincidence that in applying such critical thinking, Sinn Fein cannot find a UK gesture that it likes, such as soldiers rapidly helping increase hospital beds for the patients for whom republicans profess such concern or the Treasury using its firepower to offer big support to business and citizens.If Ms O’Neill and her party are so damning of the UK, it is strange that they never issued a critique of the records ofearly deliberations of Britain’sScientic Advisory Group for Emergencies . The war historian Sir Lawrence Freedman analysed them for the long respected, left leaning New Statesman journal. It showed how experts were agreed on some responses, but uncertain or ided on others. The UK is now behind on tests but few nations have found it easy: the Republic set up community tests before retreatingwhen it was swamped. Testing has been a problem for all but the most prepared places like South Korea .The UK is badly behind on Personal Protection Equipment and ventilators, as are most nations.But the WHO is not beyond criticism. Its response to the situation in China in January was at first confused and perhaps complacent and I suspect it is too trusting of the recent Chinese data of miniscule infection rates and death numbers. WHO also seemed unable to answer easily this newspaper’s elementary query on whether global data distinguished between deaths of people who had the virusand deaths caused by it . Such a distinction is crucial to understanding the lethality of coronavirus.The validity of some early UK concerns are becoming apparent, such as damage to mental health of starting lockdown too early .It is not surprising, or even wrong, that republicans saw first Brexit then Covid- as opportunity for a cherished, centuries old goal of a single independent Ireland.What is wrong is that they have bought into an abnormal system of mandatory coalition , which can only work on the basis of collective responsibility . After Brexit, Sinn Fein cited RHI to collapse devolution but then made other demands for its . Now they openly undermine cabinet colleagues, as Ms O’Neill did to the Health Minister Robin Swann on Thursday’s BBC The View.When other parties challenge this and a row ensues some people blame ‘both sides’. But most people are not fooled as to what is going on.No Irish government will ever call the party out. The question is whether the UK sovereign government one day might, and then move to make such abuse impossible.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorWHO accepts dficulties teasing out true Covid- death rates"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown and eerie sound silence ","story":"Young piper brings Belfast healthcare workers to tearsNI bar scene legend dies suddenly - people post tributes and share stories on social mediaNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionColumnistsLockdown and the eerie sound of silence...It’s the silence that gets to me.

On Monday I welcomed the sound of the refuse collection team all that banging of bins, revving of engines and happy banter as the collectors got to work, a combined noise that can be irritatingyou are out trying to go somewhere in a hurry. Bless them, theirs is a tough chore, but I’m happy to let them know I’ll be listening out for them next week because there’s not much  making a noise now that we are in lock-down.Of course, there are noisy birds and I have plenty of them around - seagulls, crows, pigeons and doves, not to mention the usual flocks of blackbirds, thrushes and a iety of small ones from robins to sparrows. Just occasionally the dog charges manically out of the door to scatter them, so I welcome his noise too. A couple of days ago a man on an ancient, noisy motorbike went past. No doubt it’s the love of his le and he was probably off work due to the viral crisis so took the opportunity to give it a spin down the road. Himself does the same occasionally when he decides to give his motorbike an airing.

He might be the heir to the throne but he’s as vulnerable as the rest of us and the shock of his misfortune saw the BBC go into overdrive. Funny how the prince got it and not Camilla, whose health has been a source of concern. The couple are now at Balmoral where, hopefully, he will find peace and quiet to get over the shock. We do worry for the Queen, who, at  years, has had to escape to Windsor. Off she went in her state car, her favourite dog on her knee, no doubt knowing she ran the same risks as the rest of us.But, back to the silence. Two weeks ago I was cursing the roaring wind when I could scarcely hear myself speak, but as I write it is dead quiet outside. Not a bush moves and there is no ruffle of leaves since its early spring and they are still forming on the branches. No-one in the vicinity is mowing a lawn or trimming a hedge with one of those cutters the noise of which I absolutely hate. Yet, I would have welcomed any noise this week. I suppose we are all a bit shell-shocked at the rapid change in our lives. When the Prime Minister came on television the day after Mothering Sunday, when the entire population, it seemed, was out enjoying the event, I could see the anger in his eyes and knew the news was bad. I knew he meant business. No more gadding about was to be permitted.On Mothers’ Day we had gone out because it was such a nice day. We decided to go to Slemish, a beautul part of thecounty, a place which gets most of its visitors on St Patrick’s Day. The beautul, mysterious former volcanic core, which Slemish is, had an air of bemusement about it at the sight of oodles of people climbing up its tracks, leaving dozens of cars at its foot. The noise of revving engines was deafening. Sights like these, I suspect, left Boris ballistic. Frankly I didn’t expect to see it, given the circumstances – we had already been warned about gadding about - so maybe now Slemish can enjoy peace and quiet until this crisis is over.So, how will we all fill our days when we can’t get out much except to buy food, greet visitors to our homes, or enjoy a coffee out with friends  In truth, I don’t know at this early stage but one thing I’m grateful for is the humour of the internet era.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Its no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites.Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly.This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs.I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that.However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.Mr Swann stressed: I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist.
