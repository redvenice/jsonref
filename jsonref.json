Now, more than 53 years later, Schatzberg is releasing a book titled Dylan By Schatzberg that showcases a comprehensive collection of both photos and countless stories. Dylan is pictured above posing inside of Schatzberg photography studio in 1965          For more than six decades,  Schatzberg has used his camera lens to capture dozens of A-listers, artists, politicians and elite musicians. Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Andy Warhol, Sammy Davis Jr., Duke of Windsor (the abdicated King Edward VIII) and Ted Kennedy have all posed for him. But of all the high-profile iniduals the 91-year-old photographer has interacted with,  Dylan was his best photographic subject. As Schatzberg says: \u0027You just point the camera at him and things happen.\u0027 The singer is pictured above in a photo while smoking a cigarette in 1965          Schatzberg shared that the pair became fast friends and would often hang out together along with other musicians at restaurants or night clubs. The photographer remarked that people have often asked if the out-of-focus image on the cover of Blonde on Blonde represented a drug trip. It doesn\u0027t. They were just really, really cold. \u0027It was something that actually is an honest image. He was cold and I was shaking, I was cold and the camera was shaking,\u0027 he said. Pictured above is another image taken of Dylan from the same shoot for the Blonde on Blonde cover in the Meat Packing District of Manhattan Schatzberg was so moved that he asked a mutual friend if the musician would agree to being photographed. The next day he was surprised to receive a phone call from Dylan\u0027s then-wife, Sara Dylan. Her husband had agreed. \u0027I showed up the next day and he was great,\u0027 Schatzberg said of his initial encounter with Dylan in a recording studio in 1965. \u0027Immediately he wanted me to hear something that he had just recorded. I was a little intimidated, but it was great.\u0027Schatzberg explained that after showing him the first set of photos he captured with his Nikon camera  that Dylan liked them and agreed to being photographed more by Schatzberg, who was then aged 38 and had already shot covers for Vogue, Life, Esquire and Glamour.\u0027The first set of pictures were done in the studio pretty much under his control. …He would feel at home in the recording studio where he knows everything that\u0027s going on. And so I asked him to come to my studio and he said yeah,\u0027 Schatzberg said.\u0027I didn\u0027t tell him that I wanted him to come to my studio because I have more control there. I wanted to be the boss. \u0027After we got to know each other, we had no problem at all, anything I suggested he took in his mind and we built a good relationship. He was just like anybody else. He was very funny and he\u0027s a very special talent.\u0027          Schatzberg, pictured above at home in his apartment with his new book, remarked: \u0027After we got to know each other, we had no problem at all, anything I suggested he took in his mind and we built a good relationship. He was just like anybody else. He was very funny and he\u0027s a very special talent\u0027          During some of Dylan\u0027s early performances, Schatzberg recounted how he did not always receive rave reviews from his audiences. When Dylan showcased a few new songs from his album Highway 61 Revisited while performing on August 28, 1965, he was booed. \u0027He said \u0027f*** \u0027em, I don\u0027t care\u0027 in response to being booed. He knew what he wanted to do with his music – he was a country singer, folk singer and that\u0027s a certain style,\u0027 Schatzberg said.

It was the beginning of February 1966, so it was very cold and he was wearing a light jacket,\u0027 he recalled of the chilly weather, which can be as low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 Celsius). \u0027So I asked him if he would go outside because I didn\u0027t like the shots I was getting into the studio. It was okay, but it wasn\u0027t something special. So he said yeah and had on a little jacket.          Of Dylan, Schatzberg said: \u0027I think of him as one of my greatest subject matters and I protect that a lot. I still do today, I just won\u0027t give my pictures to everybody or sell them to everybody.\u0027 Dylan is pictured above holding a picture frame as prop inside Schatzberg\u0027s photography studio in the mid-1960s          Schatzberg said, \u0027He\u0027s just got something to him and I felt working with him and knowing him, I was able to get into his soul and get deeper into him and a lot of my photographs I look at them and I find them amazing.\u0027 The Blowing in the Wind singer is pictured above looking deeply into the camera in another image captured by Schatzberg inside his studio           Schatzberg said that Dylan is \u0027a very special talent\u0027 and the images that are included of him in his new book showcase that. The Like a Rolling Stone singer is pictured above releasing cigarette smoke in a striking image that Schatzberg captured in the mid-1960s  Schatzberg\u0027s book also reveals a several stories about his experiences with Dylan during the 1960s while showcasing dozens of images that coincide with those stories.

I\u0027d give him a drum and he straddled the drum or do something else, because he didn\u0027t feel that I was going to make him look like a fool or anything,\u0027 the award-winning photographer stated.\u0027I think of him as one of my greatest subject matters and I protect that a lot. I still do today, I just won\u0027t give my pictures to everybody or sell them to everybody.\u0027I made him feel that he could do anything he wanted and it would be okay, and I didn\u0027t impose things on him that he felt was silly.

Was she referring to her passion for Versace or for the £200 million winging into her bank account following the takeover? Her passion for the luxury holidays she loves to share on Instagram, and will now have more time for — or her passion for her family, which has, at times, appeared pushed to breaking point by the cut-throat fashion world?Either her decision to step back has been sudden or kept a fiercely guarded secret. Last September, she was emphatic about staying in her role, saying: ‘I’m not going anywhere right now,’ and, in an interview this month, Donatella waxed lyrical about her beloved brand without so much as a hint.So, what possessed her to hand over the reins of her company?          Gianni Versace with his sister Donatella Versace in 1993. She would inherit the brand after his deathA FUTURE SET IN STONE FROM BIRTHThe daughter of an Italian seamstress, Donatella grew up idolising Gianni, eight years her senior. ‘He made cool leather mini-skirts for me, took me to discos and treated me like a woman,’ she has recalled. ‘I was his doll and his best friend.’Describing her youth as ‘the happiest time of my life’ she was, nonetheless, shackled by her sibling’s success and denied autonomy from an early age.By the time she’d completed a languages degree, Gianni, who founded Versace in 1978, was already a successful designer and Donatella’s fate had been sealed: ‘I finished university and just ran to work with him. Actually, I didn’t have a choice. He said: “You come and you don’t move any more.” ’Perhaps, after having her entire life mapped out, Donatella has finally snapped.BLINDSIDED BY HER BROTHER’S MURDERAs Gianni’s ‘accomplice’ and muse, Donatella schmoozed the stars as Santo took charge of Versace’s business side. Helped by the Versace-clad, newly coined ‘supermodels’ who strutted the catwalk singing George Michael’s Freedom in 1991 and that safety pin dress Elizabeth Hurley wore in 1994, Versace’s status was consolidated.But, on July 15, 1997, the openly gay designer was shot outside his Miami mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who apparently was jealous of Gianni’s success. Cunanan then took his own life.‘The sight of my dead brother haunts me to this day. One bullet hit his neck, the other his face,’ said Donatella, who was then married to American model Paul Beck, with whom she had Allegra and a son Daniel, now 28.She was shaken both by grief and the responsibility of having her brother’s company foisted upon her, in what she has suggested was an unfair ruse: Gianni, who idolised Allegra, then aged just 11, had left his niece 50 per cent of the company in his will, while Donatella inherited 20 per cent and Santo 30 per cent.In so doing, Donatella says, he not only ‘put a tremendous burden’ on Allegra, but effectively trapped his sister: ‘By giving half of Versace to my daughter, he forced me to take responsibility for the company until she came of age.‘Without this trick, I might have left the company after his death.’          Versace store in Milan. Michael Kors plans to open 900 more Versace stores to double salesDOUBTS, DEBTS AND A DRUG HABITNow in charge, Donatella’s early collections were panned. Having taken cocaine since her 20s, her escalating addiction became an open secret in the industry and her leadership style erratic.According to Deborah Ball, author of the book House Of Versace, Donatella rarely turned up to meetings before noon and, on occasion, openly snorted cocaine in front of staff. ‘For the first five years, I was lost,’ Donatella later admitted. ‘I made a lot of mistakes.’Having boasted sales of more than £400 million in 1997, by 2004 the company was facing debts of around £90 million. Its clothes, capitalising on a Nineties era of conspicuous consumption, seemed increasingly irrelevant in the restrained Noughties and, by the middle of the decade, the business was close to going under.‘I wanted to succeed for Gianni, because he cared so much for the company and I knew he would have wanted it to carry on,’ said Donatella.‘But I was frightened and I had no confidence.’ADDICTION LED TO ELTON’S INTERVENTIONDonatella discovered cocaine in the Eighties at celebrity-studded parties, admitting it fuelled the ‘best time’.According to Gianni’s former partner of 15 years, Antonio D’Amico, the designer was ‘furious’ when he found out about his sister’s habit from their mutual friend, Elton John.‘He was shocked,’ says D’Amico, who describes Donatella as a ‘monster’, on account of her difficult behaviour, and says she ‘became angry, frustrated and suspicious of the people around her. She was very difficult to deal with’. In 2004, during Allegra’s 18th birthday party dinner in Milan, Elton arrived to drag Donatella off to a rehab clinic in Arizona by private plane, where she remained for two-and-a-half months.Donatella says: ‘Some evenings, I couldn’t function any more and embarrassed myself in front of my children. My self-hatred became more and more intense.‘Nobody thought I would accept Elton’s offer, but a few minutes later, I traded my evening gown and diamonds for a jogging suit.‘I made my way to the airport with a ponytail and no make-up.’SAVED BY HER FEMININE REVOLUTIONAFTER emerging from rehab, Donatella focused on collections that contained less of her brother’s brash exhibitionism and were, as she put it, ‘more feminine’. The strategy worked: in 2006, the label posted profits of £14.2 million and, in 2007, sales rose 30 per cent.Recent decisions have proved similarly successful, from the appointment of British CEO Jonathan Akeroyd, hired from Alexander McQueen in 2016, to Donatella dressing her friend and model-of-the-moment Gigi Hadid in a skintight Versace jumpsuit this year. ‘My revolution was successful,’ Donatella said, her pride in the transformation clear-cut — her decision to cash in now less so.CHILDREN WHO SHUN THE LIMELIGHTGiven that Donatella describes Allegra and Daniel as her ‘greatest achievement’, it must be painful that both are deeply uncomfortable in the limelight. They are perhaps the biggest reason for selling up.Allegra — who stands to inherit some £558 million after the Versace sale goes through — is a director of the company, but is not believed to have any great involvement in it. She used her father’s surname to escape her legacy, but admitted in 2011: ‘Anywhere I went, I was Versace. I couldn’t escape and it did me harm.’Daniel, a musician living in London who inherited his uncle’s art collection, is similarly keen to distance himself from his mother.‘He doesn’t want people to know he is my son,’ Donatella has said, admitting that she had promised not to talk about him publicly.          \u0027I\u0027m more of a private jet pooch\u0027 said Audrey Versace, Donatella\u0027s a dogLOVE AFFAIRS AND ‘GORGEOUS GUYS’predatory in her approach to men, yet tight-lipped about her love life, Donatella might want to distance herself from Versace so that she can date in secret.Not that she shows much intention of settling down.‘Men are needed only for love affairs and for physical relaxation,’ she said recently, adding that there have been ‘others’ since her 2000 orce but that: ‘I don’t need a husband or companion. I don’t like to live with anybody. I’m very happy and fulfilled with my private life.’After orcing Beck following 17 years together, she has made little comment about the marriage, other than to say they are ‘estranged’, but ‘civilised’.Her reported second marriage, in 2004, to businessman Manuel Dallori, lasted just a year and has been kept even more secret.She is, however, vociferous about her appreciation for the male form, sizing up a line-up of semi-naked male models on a tongue-in-cheek Instagram video and declaring unashamedly that: ‘I love being surrounded by gorgeous guys.’‘MASK’ OF BLONDE HAIR AND MAKE-UPHaving first had highlights on the instruction of Gianni at the age of 11, her peroxide locks — at times enhanced to waist-length with extensions — are synonymous with her high-maintenance brand: her hairstyle, perma-tan and trademark black kohl-lined eyes an attempt to present a competent façade, especially during times of crisis.‘My hair got blonder and blonder, my make-up thicker and thicker,’ she recalls of the period following her brother’s death.‘I felt like the whole world was looking at me with daggers in their eyes and I created a mask that would give me protection.’Having created ‘a second Donatella: cold and aloof, aggressive and scary’, she says she hasn’t been tempted to change her hairstyle because ‘blonde is a way of life. I survived the catastrophes in my life because of the strength that my blonde hair gives me’.          Donatella Versace (pictured) had this message for fans after Michael Kors bought the brandPROTEIN AND EIGHT ESPRESSOS A DAY At a diminutive 5ft 2in, Donatella says she feels ‘naked’ without high heels — indeed, she even wore them to rehab.Her whippet-thin frame, typically showcased in skintight jeans and dresses from her own line, is the result of ‘hard work’ — she claims to have exercised every day for the past 18 years ‘for at least five minutes’ and does a 45-minute cardio and weights routine four times a week.Donatella — who quit her two packets of Marlboro Red habit in 2013 — once said she stopped seeing a personal trainer because he wouldn’t let her smoke.As for her diet, lunch is salad and protein, with eight espressos a day as well as iced water sipped from a crystal glass to sustain her.PALATIAL HOMES AND LUXURY HOLIDAYSHome for Donatella is a palatial two-storey Milan flat that used to belong to Gianni, with marble columns, gold furnishings and vases of her favourite red roses.Holidays are gleefully showcased to her 3.5 million Instagram followers, from the tour she filmed of her private pool in the Palazzo Versace in Dubai — the £500 million neoclassical palace she opened in 2016 — to the video of her on a yacht with an unidentified topless hunk, and the picture of her lying bikini-clad on her back in aquamarine water, alongside the caption: ‘Wake me up when August ends.’One can only imagine she might get used to a life of leisure. "},{"url":null,"title":"Stockport LGBT activist radio DJ 26 tried meet 15 year old boy met blackmailer","story":"    LGBT activist DJ Christopher Oatway, 26 from Stockport (pictured), tried to meet a 15-year-old boy at a Tesco store in ManchesterAn LGBT activist and radio DJ arranged to meet a 15-year-old boy through Grindr for a \u0027cuddle and a peck\u0027 -

Two houses were completely obliterated along with their inhabitants.It is a tragic irony that Flight 103 had become a sort of ‘student special’ after a terror threat to US airlines was relayed to all American diplomats in Europe with the result that many cancelled their reservations.                            Incompetence, vengeance and a cover-up at the highest levels                         The empty seats were offered at cheap rates by student travel agencies. More than half of the passengers, 137, were under 30 and many had called their parents excitedly before they boarded, saying how lucky they had been to get a cheap seat just before Christmas.That is how Dr Jim Swire, a Worcestershire GP, and his wife Jane learned that their daughter Flora was booked on the flight, heading across the Atlantic to see her boyfriend.With a loss of 259 lives on board and 11 more on the ground, the destruction of Maid of the Seas, blown up by a terrorist bomb on December 21, 1988, was the worst civil aviation disaster in British history. Yet 30 years later, we still do not officially know who is responsible for mass murder high in the air above a small Scottish market town preparing for Christmas.          Iran\u0027s former interior minister Ali Akbar Mohtasamipur authorised and financed the bombing, according to the USIt is nothing short of a scandal.There was, of course, a fall guy. Eleven years after the atrocity, a 47-year-old Libyan Arab Airlines security officer called Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was convicted on a tissue of lies which centred on the evidence of a Maltese shopkeeper who claimed to remember him buying clothes similar to those that may have been in the suitcase with the bomb that would rip through the fuselage.A low-level Libyan CIA ‘asset’ called Abdul Majid Giaka said he recalled seeing al-Megrahi collect a brown Samsonite suitcase from the Arrivals carousel in Malta’s Luqa airport on December 20, 1988. On the following morning, he alleged, the unaccompanied suitcase was loaded on to a flight to Frankfurt, from where it would be transferred to London on a Pan Am ‘feeder flight’ and loaded aboard Flight 103 – before then exploding.A further 11 years later, al-Megrahi was sentenced to life imprisonment at an extraordinary trial held in a disused American air base near Utrecht, Holland.                            Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the bombing                         After years investigating the Lockerbie disaster and its background, I have found that little of the evidence against him can be taken at face value. Instead, a very different story has emerged from the morass of lies, one that should have been apparent from the very start.It is a story of incompetence, vengeance, political expediency and then a cover-up orchestrated from the very highest levels in London and in Washington – where the real bomber is said to live today, under the cover of an American witness protection scheme.In the days and months after the crash, thousands of police, military personnel and specialised investigators from Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch scoured southern Scotland, finding debris over an area of 1,500 square miles. Investigators from the US Federal Aviation Authority and the FBI took part. Representatives of the CIA were present for reasons not ulged. Charred material said to have been found some weeks after the bombing in woods near Lockerbie was sent for analysis to Fort Halstead in Kent, the Ministry of Defence research establishment, where senior scientific officer Thomas Hayes identified bits of black plastic, metal and wire mesh as parts of a Toshiba radio-cassette player. It had contained a bomb and a small piece of circuit board that Hayes believed to be the remnants of a timer. After three years of the joint BritishUS investigation, this and other evidence pointed in one clear direction: an obscure terrorist group called the People’s Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC). Sleeper cells from the organisation had been arrested in a series of raids in Germany a few weeks before Lockerbie, in which bombs hidden in Toshiba radio-cassette players had been seized alongside a fearsome arsenal of explosives, firearms and ammunition.          Ahmed Jibril was the founder and commander of the Palestinian terror group that carried out the bombingShortly after the disaster, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, keen to boost its credentials as a political rather than terrorist organisation, published an 80-page report claiming the PFLP-GC had been paid to blow up the plane – by Iran.It also named a man called Abu Elias as a prime suspect for breaking into the Pan Am baggage store in Heathrow and planting the bomb. The baggage handling area had been broken into with bolt croppers shortly before Flight 103 took off.Years later, of course, the world would be persuaded to accept a very different story. But in September 1989, the evidence of Iranian guilt seemed so clear that the US Defense Intelligence Agency issued a public statement saying: ‘The bombing of the Pan Am flight was conceived, authorised and financed by Ali-Akbar Mohtashamipur, Iran’s former interior minister. The execution of the operation was contracted to Ahmad Jibril, leader of the PFLP-GC.’                            They agreed a price for the attack: £7.7million                         INDEED, the fate of the passengers and crew of Flight 103 was sealed not in Libya but five months earlier in Tehran after the shooting down of an Iran Air Airbus A300 by the American warship USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988.The Vincennes, sailing illegally in Iranian waters, inexplicably mistook the passenger jet for a hostile fighter, despite the fact it was climbing in Iranian airspace and its transponder clearly identified it as a civilian aircraft. All 290 people on board were killed.According to a former Iranian intelligence officer, Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini responded by ordering a ‘qisas’ – a like-for-like punishment under Sharia law – that required the destruction of an American aircraft in revenge.          Jordanian bomb-maker Marwan Khreesat built the explosive device hidden inside a Toshiba radio-cassette playerIran needed a deniable proxy and its intelligence service knew who to turn to: the PFLP-GC, with whom it had discussed collaboration a few months earlier. The group’s leader, Ahmed Jibril, was a Palestine-born former Syrian Army officer linked to Syrian and Soviet intelligence.He, in turn, hired Jordanian explosives expert Marwan Khreesat to design a bomb that could pass through airport luggage checks and, for preference, detonate over water, destroying the aircraft, killing all on board and leaving no clues. The terrorist group had already proved its bomb could work – blowing up a Swissair flight on February 21, 1970, killing all 47 passengers and crew, and an Austrian Airlines jet the same day, which managed to land safely at Frankfurt airport.When news of the qisas reached Lebanon, Jibril called Tehran and offered to execute it.It is likely that the US National Security Agency and Israeli interceptors monitored the unencrypted phone call. Evidence exists that the price agreed was in the region of £7.7 million – £1.5 million on the handshake and the balance on completion.And so, in 1988, Jibril sent a key lieutenant, 30-year-old Hafaz Mohammed Hussein Dalkamoni to the PFLP-GC’s European headquarters in the Serbian town of Krusevac, where weapons, explosives and other material were stored. His mission was to activate Jibril’s several sleeper cells in Germany. The following month, bomb-maker Khreesat was despatched to Neuss, near Dusseldorf, where the German police photographed a stream of his visitors, including a known PFLP-GC courier.Suspicions grew that an attack on Frankfurt airport – near which other members of the cell had a base – was being planned.The team were observed buying radios and computer equipment, batteries, switches, alarm clocks and cable.Telephone calls were monitored to a kebab restaurant in Cyprus, which functioned as a postbox for Jibril. And in a call to Damascus bomb-maker Khreesat said he had made changes to ‘the medicine’, which was now ‘stronger than before’.In fact, Khreesat built five bombs, concealed inside Toshiba radio-cassette players, each containing a barometric switch that started a timer when the pressure inside the plane fell to a pre-set level, meaning the aircraft would be destroyed around 38 minutes into the flight – a clear match to the Lockerbie explosion. On October 24, in a call to Amman, Jordan, Khreesat said he would be done in a few days.                            Gaddafi was actually happy to take the blame                         After a CIA warning of an imminent terror attack, the German police launched raids on a dozen apartments, including the ones at Neuss and Frankfurt.Khreesat and Dalkamoni and a dozen others were arrested in possession of an extraordinary haul of weapons and bomb- making equipment.Their car contained blasting caps and an alarm clock modified to serve as a timing device – and a Toshiba radio-cassette player already converted into a bomb.Five kilos of the Czech-made explosive Semtex were also taken away, with 5.7 kilos of another unidentified plastic explosive, three kilos of TNT and 89 detonators.How was it, then, that Libya came to take the blame, in the face of such overwhelming evidence, and why?          Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines, was sentenced to life in 2001, but released in 2009The answer lies in Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, which prompted the First Gulf War – for which Washington and London needed the compliance of Iraq’s neighbours Iran and Syria.A plausible new Lockerbie suspect had to be found and, conveniently, in June 1991 a CIA officer had ‘a hunch’ that the IranPFLP-GC theory was a false lead.Instead, he saw similarities between Lockerbie and the arrest in Senegal of two Libyans carrying 20lb of explosives and triggering devices like the one from which the Lockerbie fragments had apparently come.The theory gained traction because of Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi’s known financial support for terrorists, including the IRA, and because it turned out that Gaddafi himself was happy to accept the blame.Libya had been an international pariah under strict economic sanctions since the murder of British PC Yvonne Fletcher, shot dead in London in 1984, and it was the prospect of the lifting of these sanctions that led Gaddafi’s intelligence service to find a plausible scapegoat.The 47-year-old airline security officer Abdelbaset al-Megrahi fitted the bill. He had been abroad on business on December 20-21, passing though Malta’s Luqa airport on both days.All that was needed was evidence. Fortunately, the CIA had a very low-level Libyan ‘asset’, Abdul Majid Giaka, on secondment from his job as a mechanic for Gaddafi’s intelligence service to Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta.After a large reward was offered for information about the Lockerbie bombers, Giaka suddenly volunteered that he had seen al-Megrahi collect a brown Samsonite suitcase from the arrivals carousel in Luqa airport on December 20, 1988. The following morning, he alleged, the suitcase was loaded on to a flight to Frankfurt, from where it would be transferred to London on a Pan Am transfer and loaded aboard Flight 103.Giaka became a star prosecution witness alongside Maltese shopkeeper Tony Gauci, who testified he had sold clothes similar to those found close to the bomb to a man fitting al-Megrahi’s description.There was forensic evidence, too. A fingernail-sized fragment of a circuit board, recovered in Scottish woodland months after the crash, was identified as a remnant of the device that brought down Pan Am 103.FBI officer Thomas Thurman also identified it as part of an electronic timer made by MEBO, a Swiss firm which made circuit boards for domestic appliances and had supplied some to Libya. One of MEBO’S technicians named Ulrich Lumpert was willing to testify that he had made this particular board. On November 14, 1991 al-Megrahi and an ‘accomplice’ called Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah were formally accused at simultaneous press conferences in Edinburgh and Washington. Gaddafi was ordered to extradite them, but resisted, offering to try them in Libya.The stalemate was not resolved until almost ten years later when it was agreed the two Libyans should face justice in a Scottish court sitting at Kamp van Zeist, a disused American Air Force base in Utrecht, Holland.Al-Megrahi was found guilty. Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah was cleared, yet the stench of a fix remained. MEBO’s co-owner, Edwin Bollier, for example, revealed he had declined an FBI offer of several million dollars for a circuit board to be used in evidence and to testify that the fragment produced in court was part of one specifically supplied to Libya.In 2007, his technician Lumpert admitted he had lied. He also confessed to stealing part of a timing board from MEBO and handing it to an ‘official person investigating the Lockerbie case’.There were problems, too, with the technical evidence.FBI explosive ‘expert’ Thurman was later revealed to be a politics graduate with no relevant scientific training who had altered laboratory reports to favour the prosecution in 30 cases.Even the identifying witness, shopkeeper Gauci, was tainted. The court was not told he had initially picked out a photograph of a completely different terror suspect and only in the course of 18 further statements did his description of the clothes shopper change to fit al-Megrahi. Gauci’s financial reward from the CIA was not disclosed.The investigators glossed over the question of how the terrorists were supposed to prime their bomb in Malta and expect it to explode two flights later.The small number of people who had followed the trial, including relatives of victims such as Jim Swire and the Rev John Mosey, each of whom lost a daughter, and the official United Nations observer Professor Hans Kochler, considered the verdict a gross miscarriage of justice.On August 20, 2009, al-Megrahi, in the final stages of terminal prostate cancer, was released on compassionate grounds ahead of his second appeal against conviction.Shortly after he was flown back to Libya, Alistair Darling, then the Chancellor, and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond both denied the release had anything to do with a deal struck with the Libyan government over BP oil contracts.However, there is another reason why the release might have been politically expedient. Al-Megrahi’s new lawyers wanted to call hundreds of pages of evidence withheld from his original trial that would have linked the case to Iran and the PFLP-GC, rather than al-Megrahi and Libya – to the huge embarrassment of Westminster and Washington.The Labour Government was so concerned that Foreign Secretary David Miliband issued a public interest immunity certificate exempting the prosecution from disclosing any evidence it chose to hide.Most of the participants in the story went to the grave without the truth being told. Al-Megrahi died at home with his family on May 20, 2012. Palestinian terror leader Ahmed Jibril was blown up by a roadside bomb placed by an Al Qaeda-linked group on August 26, 2014. Bomb-maker Marwan Khreesat reportedly died in October 2016.Only the mysterious Abu Elias, claimed to be the person most likely to have placed the Samsonite suitcase on Flight 103, is believed to be still alive. He was named in the Scottish parliament in 2009 and is thought to be living in Washington DC under a witness protection programme and employed by the local education authority under the name of Basel Bushnaq.

It would also coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.A new delivery body will be set up to co-ordinate the event under a creative director, who will work alongside Mr Wright’s department.

When asked to rank the subjects most important to ‘me and my family’, the top concern was the cost of living, followed by the NHS.Brexit was only the third most important issue, despite it consuming most of the energies of the May administration.          Theresa May arriving at the Tory Party conference in Birmingham. The gathering is set to be dominated by Brexit When asked which party did most to ‘help ordinary people get on in life’, Labour held a lead of 24 percentage points.Lord Ashcroft concludes that Mrs May will struggle to win a commanding lead over Labour because many of the poorer voters who back her determination to push through with Brexit had been alienated by Conservatives’ public spending cuts – which Mr Corbyn has exploited by pledging to reverse.Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Lord Ashcroft says: ‘This is why Mrs May found it impossible to achieve a majority in last year’s snap Election.’He added: ‘It is also why, in the event of a parliamentary impasse over the Brexit deal, she would be unwise to expect a better outcome from a new Election than she got from the last one.’On Brexit, Lord Ashcroft – whose 10,000-plus sample size is more than four times larger than a typical opinion poll – found that voters appear to be losing confidence in the Prime Minister’s ability to negotiate a good deal.When asked to rate their confidence out of 100, voters gave an average score of just 31 – down from 40 in May this year and 52 in March 2017.          Tory delegates were unnerved by Labour’s unusually slick and upbeat conference in Liverpool last week with Jeremy Corbyn Part of the reason is that the EU is widely perceived to hold the whip hand in the negotiations, with 53 per cent of voters regarding the EU as stronger. Just 13 per cent believe the UK is stronger.There was significant support for the idea that the best way for Mrs May to get the best deal was for her to ‘stand up to Brussels’.A total of 40 per cent think she should threaten to walk away without a deal, compared with 28 per cent who want her to seek more compromises.And despite growing concern within Government over the consequences of a no deal, only one third of voters believe it will lead to major disruption and shortages.Lord Ashcroft also found that most of those in his focus groups had little idea about the details of Mrs May’s Chequers plan, other than it had prompted Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis to resign.One member said: ‘You get the feeling it’s draft one, and draft two is going to follow.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Lord Ashcroft tells Theresa key issues win election","story":"    Prime Minister Theresa May is right to threaten to leave without a deal, rather than seek further compromise with an intransigent EU We know we voted to leave the EU by 52 per cent to 48 per cent, but we are also still precisely ided over austerity – whether the Government was right to try to balance the books in the way it did after 2010.The trouble is, these two powerful ides cut across each other: just under half of Leave voters backed austerity, while a third of pro-austerity voters wanted to remain in the EU.

But too many who agreed with her about that could not bring themselves to support what they still thought of as the party of cuts and too many who had accepted austerity would not vote for what had become, in their eyes, the party of Brexit.This is why Mrs May found it impossible to achieve a majority at last year’s Election.It is also why, in the event of a parliamentary impasse over the Brexit deal, she would be unwise to expect a better outcome from a new Election than she got from the last one. In my poll, Leave voters who wanted a clean break with the EU and backed austerity, put their likelihood of voting Tory at the next Election twice as high as hard Brexiteers who opposed the cuts.          David Cameron assembled a winning coalition of voters around his long-term economic plan based on restoring order to the public finances Only 13 per cent of anti-austerity Leave voters who want a hard Brexit – the people the PM hoped to attract last June – think the Conservatives are on the side of people like them.That is not to say that Brexit doesn’t matter. My research finds confidence that the Government will achieve a good deal has fallen steadily over the past 18 months, especially among Leave voters. Many expect a messy compromise in which we will still be closely tied to the EU.Though few know what is in the Chequers plan (‘you get the feeling it’s draft one, and draft two is going to follow’, as one of our focus group participants observed sagely), many Leavers are alarmed by the idea of a common rulebook – meaning the UK agrees to follow EU rules and regulations. Voters who say they want a soft Brexit are, in practice, reluctant to compromise on any of the things they think Brexit should mean: independent law-making, our own free-trade deals, stopping free movement, and ending payments to the EU. Yet most voters feel that Brussels has the stronger hand in the negotiations.But Brexit is just one of the things the Government has to deal with, and in many voters’ eyes it isn’t even the most important. It comes a close second to the NHS when we ask what matters most, but falls to a distant third when we ask people about priorities for themselves and their families, with the cost of living at the top of the list.Labour is believed to have the best approach to both these issues by a comfortable margin.Labour has its own problems, of course. Nearly four in ten of the anti-austerity voters it relies on backed Leave in the referendum – and while many of them cheerfully voted Labour last year, they might not be impressed if the party carries on saying it is not ‘ruling out remain as an option’, as Sir Keir Starmer did last week.I found many Labour voters lamenting the lack of leadership that allowed the anti-Semitism row to rumble on for months, and disquiet at Jeremy Corbyn’s ‘shifty’ response to claims of connections with terror groups.           But the Tories would be foolish to rely on Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell to win them another term, even after the Marxist fantasies they flaunted in Liverpool last week.After all, they were on the ballot at the last Election, which nearly ended in disaster for the Tories. They must recognise that people are desperate to move on from Brexit – as desperate as Mrs May herself must surely be.If the issue must dominate the agenda at Cabinet, it can’t dominate the conference, or what the party has to say to the voters.The thing that most unites people who lean towards the Conservatives is not Brexit or any other area of policy – it is the belief that the party shares their values.This is the key. If the Tories can’t bring the pro-austerity band back together or unite Leavers under its banner, it must find a new way to show people it knows what it is doing and is on their side.Looking at the things that drove many non-Tories to want to leave the EU – concerns about housing, public services, economic opportunity and the quality of life – would be a good place to begin.Rebuilding the Conservative brand will be a tall order this week, but the work must start now.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Michael Gove holds tears describes parents adopted him","story":"    Michael Gove was adopted when he was four months old by a working-class Aberdonian family            Former running mates Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have both slimmed down lately.

About 11pm.                                                    ‘I often think about my parents and I often do think about my birth mother.‘And yes, when I go home and when I see my mum and dad, when I sit on the seat that I sat on when I was watching football on the telly with my dad, I go back in many respects to being the boy that I was then,’ says Gove, who believes that his birth mother is aware of his career.Looking deeply affected, he goes on: ‘There’s a picture in our living room at home of the Cabinet, the one that the Queen visited. I think it is surreal that there I am and I think my 13- or 14-year-old self would never have imagined that I would have had the opportunities that I’ve had. It does weigh on me that you’ve got to live up to the care and love that you’ve received.’After serving a brief penance on the backbenches following his doomed leadership bid two years ago, Mr Gove is once again a pivotal figure in the Government, turning his Environment department into a campaigning hub – most notably with his successful ban on polluting plastics.But he is also playing a central role in the great political drama of Brexit, with an under-pressure Downing Street grateful for his soothing ministrations as Theresa May fights to save her Chequers plan in the face of hostility from both the EU and Tory Brexiteers.Boris Johnson has led the rebellion, firing a ferocious salvo on the eve of Tory conference in a newspaper article which described Chequers as a ‘moral and intellectual humiliation’ and backed a free trade agreement similar to that signed with the EU by Canada. Mr Gove is playing a typically canny game behind the scenes – publicly supporting the PM, while privately trying to ‘wargame’ a cross-Cabinet strategy to avert a ‘no deal’ scenario, which he fears could cause more economic disruption than many fellow Brexiteers claim.Along with pro-Remain Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid, he is growing increasingly convinced that the Canada option should be on the table, rather than a stark choice between Chequers or no deal.Other so-called ‘Govoid’ acolytes include Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom.Mr Gove offers tacit endorsement for remarks made by Mr Hunt last week, when the Foreign Secretary was asked if the Canada model should be considered as an alternative to Chequers.           Along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr Gove is growing increasingly convinced that the Canada option should be on the tableTo the fury of some in No 10, Mr Hunt said that he was ‘not dismissing anything’.Asked if he agrees with Mr Hunt, Mr Gove says: ‘It’s in Jeremy’s nature always, and I am trying to learn from this myself, not to criticise but to concentrate on the positive. \u0027Jeremy is one of the most naturally considerate, thoughtful and polite people in politics. I’m sure he would have considered his comments carefully and they would therefore have merit and should be listened to.’Mr Gove also lavishes praise on Mr Johnson, sidestepping the critique of Chequers by claiming not to have read Friday’s 4,500-word article. ‘I’m a fan of Boris and I like and admire him. I respect his viewpoint and I’m looking forward to reading the article,’ he says. ‘I suspect there will be some things in it with which I will disagree.’He adds: ‘He’s done so much and I have huge regard for him.          Mr Gove also lavishes praise on Mr Johnson and says ‘I’m a fan of Boris and I like and admire him\u0027 ‘He is one of the most significant and attractive figures in British politics.’Does he think Mrs May feels betrayed by Boris? ‘The thing about the Prime Minister is that she’s an incredibly resilient and focused person and so I think she accepts Boris is someone with strong views.’Quizzed about whether he has changed his view that Mr Johnson was not fit to be Prime Minister, Mr Gove says: ‘I think if I were to try to rank any of my other colleagues that would only distract attention from concentrating on what we really need to do, which is to get that deal.’However, his friendship with David Cameron appears terminally ruptured: the former Prime Minister, encouraged by wife Samantha, refuses to forgive Gove for campaigning for Brexit.          Mr Gove\u0027s friendship with David Cameron (pictured) appears terminally ruptured as he refuses to forgive Gove for campaigning for Brexit- encouraged by wife Samantha (pictured) Although he laughs when told that Cameron has joked he has made such little progress with his No 10 memoirs that Gove is ‘still one of the good guys’, the split must be painful – particularly since Cameron has not spurned Mr Johnson in the same way.Some Gove friends argue that class – Cameron and Johnson are Old Etonians – has played a role in this apparent double standard.Gently evading the issue, Mr Gove says: ‘I won’t speculate about what other people think or feel. I think other people can run all sorts of theories. I haven’t seen David for a while but I wish him well.‘I think he was a great Prime Minister and I think that he’s a great guy and I wish him only the best for the future.’Invited to picture a kiss-and-make-up dinner party between all three men, he says: ‘I think if I was at a dinner party with them then I would definitely have to buy the wine and I would do my best to make sure it was a very nice bottle.’The threat from Jeremy Corbyn, after a successful party conference in Liverpool, is also exercising the minds of senior Conservatives as they arrive in Birmingham – and how they can match the success of his populist, soak-the-rich economics. ‘If Jeremy Corbyn got into power, it would be a disaster for this country,’ Mr Gove says.          The threat from Jeremy Corbyn, after a successful party conference in Liverpool (pictured) is also exercising the minds of senior Conservatives ‘The economic prospectus that they’ve laid out is terrifying and I think that we would see the country suffer as never before. It’s an historical fact that every time Labour has left office, unemployment has been higher than it was when they entered.‘There is no doubt that Corbyn’s proposals would lead to an investment freeze, to jobs going and it would hit the poorest in the pocket hardest.’He singles out housing and education policy as priorities for the Conservatives to combat the Corbyn threat.Mr Gove, who is married to the columnist Sarah Vine and lives in West London with their two children, is famed among his colleagues for an almost theatrical level of courtesy and charm, which some wonder might be a shield to conceal the ‘real’ Gove.  Asked if he deploys it as a ‘barrier’, he says: ‘It is a very good question. I do think that I have got powers of self-analysis and it’s partly how I was brought up – my mum always said you should treat other people as you would like to be treated yourself.’          Mr Gove is married to the columnist Sarah Vine (pictured) and lives in West London with their two childrenThe same colleagues wonder if his formative years helped to sharpen his ambition: researchers have found that prominent politicians are significantly more likely to have come from childhoods disrupted by orce, estrangement or bereavement.He becomes reflective: ‘My adoptive parents, my parents made a choice and therefore I do feel from time to time that I’ve got to prove to them that they didn’t make a mistake and so it does weigh on my mind that I’ve got to try to put something back. I’ve got to demonstrate to them that they were right to take a chance on me.’He also acknowledges the impact of watching his father struggle to support his family – including a period of school fees for the precocious Gove – when his fish-processing business was ailing.‘My experiences growing up, my dad’s business and what happened to it, the nature of my sister being adopted and being profoundly deaf as well, that must have an impact on me. I think – I could be wrong – that it’s given me a sense of the fragility of things. My sister overcoming her disability, my dad recovering from bad business news, it makes you realise that happiness rests on a fragile crust and therefore it is very, very important to recognise how important it is to do everything you can to help support people through difficult times, but also to recognise how fortunate you are, how fortunate I am in the circumstances I am currently in.‘I haven’t sought out my birth mother and that’s partly because I worried that it would seem to my parents, my adoptive parents, that I had something missing and I was looking to fit in a missing part and they have been such brilliant parents.’He says he has discussed his decision not to find his birth mother with his children.‘I do think about it. It’s a funny thing, when you go to the doctor and they ask you, is there a history of X in your family and I’ll say I’m adopted and so on.‘I sometimes think of my children and I can recognise traits in them, sometimes I can see Sarah’s traits and sometimes I can see mine, sometimes I can see Sarah’s parents’ traits in them, but there are aspects of the parents that show up in their make-up that obviously relate to my birth mother.’He said his son William, a talented footballer, was pleased because he ‘can decide whether to play for Scotland or England as a result of it’, adding: ‘It is an amazing thing that there is no sporting ability as far as I can see in myself and yet he has somehow got it from somewhere.’So does that ambition still extend to No 10? ‘I had a crack, it didn’t work out.‘We’ve got the right Prime Minister now,’ he insists."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/20/01/506DB7DD00000578-0-image-a-8_1537402763357.jpg","title":"One five children secret social media accounts hide parents","story":"    There\u0027s been rapid growth in ‘fake Insta’ accounts – a reference to photo-sharing site InstagramFormer Teacher of the Year, 42, \u0027posed as a 17-year-old boy...‘Sorry darling’: Female teacher, 51, who groomed a...Share this articleTwenty per cent of pupils said they operate a sanitised ‘main’ account to show parents, while also having private ones.

Instead, I scurry off to another Momentum event, this time in protest at how our natural resources have been seized, and sold back to us at extortionate rates. Like most people, I rail in frustration at the prices charged by utility companies in Liverpool alone, one in seven households lives in fuel poverty.This is a great cause, I think, taking my seat. Will a Labour government mean we will be able to heat our homes? Unfortunately, I\u0027ve come to the wrong place to find out. The issue is debated by a rag-tag bunch of well-meaning hippies belonging to something called Artists4Corbyn. They have apparently sailed here in a boat from their protest at an offshore wind turbine farm perhaps that\u0027s why their hair is so wild.But I remain sympathetic – until they begin to put their argument in the form of… poetry, taking turns for each verse: \u0027The broad, brown streaming of the Mersey…\u0027I leave, just before we are asked to make the \u0027Whoop, whoop\u0027 sound of giant blades out at sea. This would all make for comedy gold, were this Labour conference not the most important – for the future of the UK, and for Europe – since 1940.Wandering from venue to venue, I do indeed meet lots of well-meaning, mostly older Labour party members who really care, about things other than themselves.They talk with sense and some sadness: of parents who were shop stewards and are now not getting the care they need of jobs lost when manufacturing collapsed of young people unable to own a home, of whole communities becoming ghost towns.All this against the shiny backdrop of modern day Liverpool, burnished by capitalism and EU money.When I point out how nice it all seems, I\u0027m told, \u0027It\u0027s an amusement park. It\u0027s not real. We preferred it when it was covered in soot. Who can afford to live in all those dockside flats?\u0027 In contrast, when I chat to younger grassroots members, I\u0027m taken aback by how confident they are, how cocksure of their facts, and how myopically self-serving.I\u0027m puzzled by their uncompromising, unsmiling stance: Boris might be a philandering oaf, Gove might be backtracking on banning live animal exports, but at least they know to turn on the charm. This lot want to run me out of town.At a talk (with added karaoke) held by the Labour Animal Welfare Society, I join a couple for the vegan buffet. Talk is of the tenth anniversary of the global crash, and its negative impact on wildlife.

Pictures of the Beluga whale taken in Gravesend by British Divers Marine Life Rescue          Wildlife enthusiasts look at beluga whale swimming in the River Thames near GravesendExperts from the organisation have been monitoring the whale, which could stay in the Thames for months.Mr Marsh said: \u0027We are not putting ers down and you can\u0027t tell from the body. We will watch and observe. But we are having meetings and discussions behind the scenes.\u0027It looks as if it is feeding very well. There is plenty of food for it in the Thames. A lot of the food it eats in the Arctic can be found in the Thames.\u0027The reason it is staying is, I think, because there are algae on the barges and buoys and that is what the fish are attracted to. There will be sprats in the area and it also eats herring and crustaceans.\u0027They adapt if there is food there.\u0027People wanting to see the whale this weekend should do so from the shore, he added.          Drone footage gives closer look of the beluga whale which has been spotted in the ThamesLucy Babey, Head of Science \u0026amp Conservation at ORCA, a charity dedicated to studying and protecting whales, dolphins and porpoises in the UK and European waters, said Benny was \u0027behaving very normally\u0027.She said: \u0027Belugas do usually travel in small pods (groups) and different pods can come together to form large groups, but reports of lone or pairs of beluga are increasing.\u0027Those seen around the UK have always been of lone iniduals or pairs.\u0027At this stage it is not known why the whale found its way to the Thames, but the most likely theory is due to a navigational error in its sonarecholocation system.\u0027In other species this is known to occur if the inidual is unwell or if there was any disturbance or noise in the water (natural environmental noise or man-made noise).\u0027The animal appears to be behaving normally and swimming strongly and is also showing signs of feeding and foraging behaviour, which is a good thing.\u0027Its movement within the Thames most probably relates to the tide and location of food.\u0027Fears for Benny the Beluga as exhausted whale is spotted in Thames shipping lanes instead of turning back to sea"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/04/4E2E817200000578-0-image-m-45_1531453379780.jpg","title":"Titanic shipping firms letter apologising losing 69 cases wine uncovered","story":"    Will Wrightson, wine expert and team leader at Berry Bros and Rudd, with a framed copy of the letter from White Star Line          Titanic foundered after smashing into an iceberg on its way to New York on April 15, 1912 and 1,503 people were killed in the disaster  Following the discovery, the company decided to share a photograph of the original, which is now kept securely in a safe\u0027Details of shipment are shown at foot.

A person walks on a vegan slogan painted on a crosswalk and reading \u0027animals are not ingredients\u0027, in a street of Lille, northern FranceBoucherie Abolition fights \u0027for the abolition of the genocide called butchery\u0027.Its spokeswoman Solveig Halloin told AFP. \u0027Animal breeding should not be a career. The methods of rearing animals are violent and amount to persecution.\u0027Halloin does not say whether her group is behind the attacks on butcher shops, but neither does she condemn the violence.\u0027The extremists in brutality are the butchers,\u0027 she said.Applying the word \u0027genocide\u0027 to the slaughtering of animals - the term is a specific legal crime applied to the killing of humans on account of their race or identity - reflects the \u0027speciest\u0027 beliefs of radical groups such as Boucherie Abolition.So-called \u0027speciests\u0027 reject the idea of an animal hierarchy that places humans at the top, arguing instead that all animals should be treated equally.Veganism gains ground Last Saturday, Boucherie Abolition and 269 Life France organised demonstrations in front of dozens of butchers\u0027 shops across France.In Paris, Vincent Aubry and another campaigner carried around a young pig - which are prized for their tenderness when roasted.Aubry did not condemn the smashing of butchers\u0027 windows either and he said he was \u0027prepared to go to prison if needed.\u0027\u0027Our only limit is violence against human beings,\u0027 he said.The risk of confrontation between those who depend on rearing and slaughtering animals for their living and those who are determined to stop what they consider to be mass killing appears to be rising.The CFBCT confederation accuses the vegans of \u0027wanting to impose on the immense majority of people their lifestyle, or even their ideology.\u0027Marianne Celka, a researcher at the Paul-Valery University in Montpellier in southern France, sees \u0027no chance of conciliation\u0027 between the two sides.But she highlights how veganism is gaining ground in France, with some major supermarkets now stocking \u0027100 percent vegan\u0027 products - sometimes opposite their meat aisles.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13f7ce80d9e4b06f144e220e96d4742df2cefbc6/0_442_6005_3602/master/6005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d9807578170dbd14c7ae5d3a942cc6d","title":"the big picture untitled iv balloons anne hardy party over","story":"Anne Hardy’s photograph invites us to make up stories.

And what of the demon bunny on the shelf?For years, Hardy has created such fictional rooms in her studio in Hackney, east London, mostly out of rubbish she has found on walking tours of the streets nearby. Sometimes, she makes casts of the things she finds and uses the cast in her pictures. She has habitually spent months putting a room together and then, when it has felt complete, she has photographed it and moved on to the next set of found objects. In recent years, she has created some rooms as installations and allowed visitors in, leaving their shoes at the door. She says of her work that she hopes it is like “pulling up the lino in your kitchen and finding another five layers beneath”. She was supposed to be a scientist, she adds, but became an artist by accident.Hardy’s photograph features in a book called Making It Up: Photographic Fictions, edited by Marta Weiss, curator of photographs at the V\u0026ampA. Weiss argues that, though we have always tended to look to photographs for factual reality, the urge to create fictions with them is as old as the medium itself.

Existing ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in specialist stores like Boots.The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly – something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.The rise of online shopping and shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.Mike Coupe, the supermarket chain’s chief executive, has said that Sainsbury’s outlets will look increasingly like department stores as they try to fight back against the rise of the discounters such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.Sainsbury’s has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.The supermarket’s previous attempt to boost its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure. Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist’s stores in its supermarkets.The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago. It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers. We’ve also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.“Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we’re now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a4970e7b114ecd2d5e3cbe213470a04a30869d/0_95_4529_2716/master/4529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=050a11580494bf66588a55c6e1c25c87","title":"fifty years of the jumbo jet in pictures","story":"The Boeing 747 ‘jumbo jet’ celebrates its 50th birthday today having first rolled off its custom-built assembly plant in Everett, Washington, in the US on 30 September 1968.

Even as shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s plans for reshaping British capitalism were being dismissed as a regression to statism and trade union power, his critics were bemoaning that the Tories’ response was either a pale imitation of the same or a reheated and tired Thatcherism. Worse for his critics, McDonnell was winning a hearing because he spoke to widely held concerns about the economy.Suddenly, the economic debate has broken out of the ascendancy of variants of Thatcherism. As an advocate of stakeholder capitalism for more than 20 years, I was both taken aback and pleased to find McDonnell praising the ideas on the Today programme – and just as taken aback that some Tories want to develop their own version.But stakeholder capitalism is not a series of half-remembered magic solutions to breathe new life into traditional socialism or relegitimise free-market conservatism. It is a self-standing, distinct set of interlinked propositions about how capitalism can be made to work for all, requiring a radical change of mindset from the traditional left and libertarian right alike.The starting point is that the capitalist firm is of necessity a social organisation. Entrepreneurialism is not about a succession of inidualistic sole traders having lightbulb moments that can only turn into successful businesses if there is little regulation and minimal tax. Rather, wealth-creation, innovation and productivity growth reside in the complicated business of marshalling people and resources. This requires lots of compromises and trade-offs, in substantive institutions that work better the stronger the social glue and shared sense of purpose.That means being animated by more than simply making profits, crucial though that is to the life of the enterprise. Purpose – to create “the happiness of its members” (John Lewis), say, or to make “a better everyday life for the many” (Ikea) – brings the unity of vision around which the firm can manage all the competing claims upon it. Moreover, that purpose is the key to building any sustainable business and means it cannot be a vehicle solely to enrich those at the top.Seen through this prism, workers are not locked in a do-or-die struggle with capital to which the resolution is the socialisation of production. Rather, they are in a complicated relationship of interdependence, resolving conflicts in a joint project of creating great goods and services. In the 1970s, leftwing trade union leaders Hugh Scanlon and Rodney Bickerstaffe were bitterly opposed to workers on boards as proposed by the Bullock commission under James Callaghan: it was a betrayal of socialism’s existential struggle with capitalism. Today, John McDonnell has crossed a line: by wanting workers as shareholders and represented on boards, he signals that capitalism can be made to work for the common good. His comrades from the 1970s would turn in their graves.This is only the beginning of a very long march. If McDonnell wants to reshape capitalism rather than abolish it, then he needs to further change his mindset and think more systemically. For example, he would have been wiser to plump for another model of employee ownership – the voluntary employee-owned trust– than his controlling, top-down variant. For what stakeholder capitalism aims to achieve is a private sector that improves worker and customer welfare within its own terms. The state sets the framework: it pump-primes it strategises it may even create a sovereign wealth fund, but all designed to achieve stakeholder vibrancy.On this, McDonnell said nothing. Worker directors, which he advocates, risk suffering acute conflicts of interest in today’s unreformed firms, as the old left feared (and many board fear too). It is stakeholder companies, unified around a common purpose, which dissolve structural conflicts. This world is already being tentatively embraced, as would be clear to him and critics if they had read the latest Financial Reporting Council’s corporate governance code. It even calls for boards to experiment with a worker-director to guarantee the firm’s purpose. McDonnell could build on these. He could propose a new Companies Act to make a commitment to purpose a condition of forming a company. Companies need more long-term, engaged, substantive shareholders on whom they can depend.He could turn his attention to Britain’s asset management industry and direct it to take its obligations to steward companies much more seriously. He could explain how he wants to reshape the financial system to lower the cost of capital. He could wean himself off an instinctive reflex to nationalise by embracing different corporate forms through which social benefit can be delivered. He could declare that his aim is to create a new generation of great British companies whose strength will be built on the new communities of interest between repurposed trade unions, customers and long-term shareholders. He could build a great political coalition of the left and the centre.This, of course, would be better done within the EU. Stakeholder capitalism, a revived social contract and stopping Brexit are parts of the same vision – a very different one from the Brexiter notion of a turbo-boosted Thatcherism. Labour is inching nearer to a position that would win a public vote and be the basis for national renewal thereafter. There is no other viable political force or set of propositions to save the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7ba263f060f53b8bab714500faad68277b3a125/0_186_5610_3368/master/5610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=219f8428535ee488f5a233dde5729aa3","title":"on my radar geoff dyer burning man the necks luigi ghirri","story":"The writer and critic Geoff Dyer was born in Cheltenham in 1958 and educated at Oxford University.

As usual the new release is a single hour-long track but this time in four distinct sections. And whereas live they’re always just piano, bass and drums, the studio albums can involve overdubbing, so drummer Tony Buck here doubles up on electric guitar. I won’t spoil listeners’ enjoyment by saying exactly when it happens but at one point Body rocks so hard and suddenly that the G-force will pin you back in your seat.On a plane from Iceland I noticed the guy in the seat across the aisle wearing really cool shoes. They were made by an Italian company I’d never heard of and buying them online proved tricky. The ones I liked were from their urban hiking range: stylish, resilient and (the guy on the plane had allowed me to try on his) comfy as slippers. I had to get the right size couriered to Rome from a store near the company’s mysterious HQ. This needed to be done in a hurry as I was only there for a couple days so the Lomer person said he would send them right away – we could sort out payment later. That’s how to build customer loyalty! I now own three pairs.A chasm separates my lack of desire to go mountain climbing and an insatiable desire to watch films about people climbing mountains – on my sofa, wearing my Lomers. I’m guessing that advances in camera technology mean that we’re in a golden age of climbing docs. The first of these two vertiginous films follows Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson attempting the first free ascent of the Dawn Wall of El Capitan in Yosemite. Free Solo is even freer in that Alex Honnold, while opting for an easier shimmy up El Capitan, does so without partner or ropes: a sheer existential definition of self.Granted, it’s not new (I got my faded copy in 1986) but I’ve only just read this book on the Battle of the Little Bighorn. There have been plenty of books about the “last stand” which saw Custer’s Seventh Cavalry wiped out by a loose alliance of Native Americans already pushed to the brink of extinction, but this remains in a league of its own. It reads as if Roberto Calasso has been let loose in the wild west to pursue his researches in obsessively detailed documentary mode, with unwavering stylistic assurance.

The death of founder Larry Harvey in April meant that this always had the potential to be a special year but in the event – and in the interests of avoiding hyperbole – several things became apparent. One, it was, even more stupendous than when I first went in 1999. Two, the quality of art has improved to the extent that Burning Man has left other contemporary art gatherings trailing in its (very dusty) wake.

That said, the blueberry sauce I made to dress a soft beef roll the other day is worth 10 minutes of anyone’s time. Essentially blueberries with an underlying piquancy from red wine vinegar, juniper and rosemary, this would have worked just as splendidly with cold roast pork. I spooned the inky-blue dressing over crisp, pinkly pickled onions and thin slices of rare beef and sandwiched it all in a suitably giving brioche bun. It took all of 10 minutes and beat my kneejerk dressing of horseradish mayo hands down.The other sandwich worth mentioning this week was of the open variety – a slice of toasted sourdough supporting a crisp, pickle-sharp salad of cauliflower, artichoke and peppers. It had something of a caponata about it, and the basil dressing soaked its way pleasingly into the thick, crisp toast. More of a light lunch than a snack really.Despite my claim of not planning for sandwiches, there must be some explanation for why shopping always includes smoked mackerel, cream cheese and treacly pumpernickel. The ingredients for my go-to sandwich. And why else would I buy buns and pitta and tortillas if not to use them as a way to eat slices of cold roast pork and apple sauce without use of knife and fork? Secretly, I know damn well that there will be the need, before the week is over, to stick something delectable between two pieces of bread and wolf it. A week without a sandwich is, at least in this kitchen, unthinkable.I have given details for cooking the beef here in case you want to make it from scratch, but the recipe is really about leftovers, and Sunday lunch is more likely to be the source of your beef. The dressing is enough for at least 4 buns.Serves about 10Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Season the rump, rubbing a little oil, salt and finely ground black pepper on all sides. Warm a thin film of oil in a roasting tin over a high heat, then add the seasoned meat, letting it brown lightly on each side, turning it over as necessary. Transfer the meat to the oven and roast for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on how rare you like your beef. Remove the meat from the oven and leave to rest before carving.While the meat roasts, peel the red onion, slice it thinly and put it into a small mixing bowl. Pour over the red wine vinegar and add a little salt, then the spiky leaves of the rosemary, finely chopped. Lightly crush the juniper berries, then fold them into the onion and its marinade and set aside in a cool place.While the beef is resting, drain the marinade from the onions into a small pan. Add the blueberries, sugar and a grinding of black pepper, and bring to the boil. As soon as the sugar has dissolved, remove from the heat. The flavour should be slightly sweet and with a deep, fruity acidity. Set aside (it will keep for a few days in the fridge, covered).Split the brioche buns horizontally, then toast them on their cut sides until golden. I like to do this over a heated griddle pan, but a toaster will do. Slice the beef thinly, removing only enough for the sandwiches you are currently making (you will get at least 10 slices from the weight above). Wash and dry the watercress then place a handful on each bottom half of brioche, then add the beef, rings of pickled onions and a spoonful of blueberry dressing. Place the second half of each bun on top and serve.A fine salad in its own right, this stir-up of crisp cauliflower and soft ripe peppers takes on a new substance once it is piled, perilously high, on rounds of toast.shallots 4, mediumRomano peppers 2 red and 2 yellowaubergine 1, smallcauliflower half a small onegarlic 6 clovesolive oil 5 tbspmarinated artichokes 250golives 100g, stonedsourdough bread 6 slicestomatoes 2, largebasil leaves 2 handfulsPreheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6.

Cut the cauliflower into florets and tuck among the vegetables. Peel the garlic and add to the tin. Trickle over the olive oil, making sure all the vegetables are lightly coated.

Skin the roasted peppers – it should come away easily – then cut into long strips. Roughly chop the aubergine then toss with the cauliflower, garlic, peppers, shallots, artichokes and olives.

At the end of the 290-mile journey from Chiavari, their home town in Liguria, to Rome, they will alight at the Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) and will not leave until they have received some answers. They plan a form of sit-in protest and the crux of their complaint only scratches the surface of a shambolic state of affairs that has left Italy’s lower leagues in turmoil. Why, they want to know, do they not have a ision to play in when the season is already six weeks old?“Never in my life did I think I’d be directly involved in a situation like this,” says Cleur, a 20-year-old full-back from Australia. Two weeks ago he was sent off in Entella’s first match of the Serie C season, a 3-1 win at Gozzano, but that detail barely feels relevant now. They have not played since then and, if they have their way, will not fulfil any further fixtures in the third tier. Entella believe they are entitled to a place in this season’s Serie B and their matches have, as a result, been postponed indefinitely. The problem is that the FIGC, Italy’s football association, are yet to confirm that they agree. No decision is expected until 9 October and until then Entella are out on a limb: a ghost club with no games to play, training every day to no end, livelihoods up in the air while Italy’s arcane judicial system grinds towards an uncertain conclusion.Cleur says it has been “mentally draining” and that even the club’s senior players, battle-hardened professionals who probably felt they had the measure of Italian football’s less edifying aspects by now, have been left feeling confused and powerless. That is because this situation has been rumbling on for almost three months. Last season Entella finished 19th of 22 teams in Serie B, the best of four relegated sides. In mid-July they received a lifeline: Cesena, Bari and Avellino, who had all finished clear of the drop, were declared bankrupt and denied permission to resume in the second ision. The logical conclusion was that their places would be taken by some of those who had gone down.But common sense has gone out of the window in a complex, enervating and seemingly endless series of legal wrangles that have achieved next to nothing. Serie B decided to go ahead with only 19 teams in 2018-19, despite the FIGC planning a play-off competition to determine the three replacements. That prompted appeals from six clubs, Entella among them, who felt a place was rightfully theirs. Italy’s Olympic committee, Coni, oversaw the hearings and originally turned them down.In Entella’s case, everything appeared to change two days after that winning start in Serie C. They were informed by Coni that a 15-point deduction for Cesena, who have since reformed as a phoenix club in Serie D, would be backdated to 2017-18, meaning that Entella – who had finished six points behind them – could technically leapfrog them to safety. Never mind the sheer farce of competing in two isions during the same season: their league calendar was suspended and, for Cleur and his teammates, justice appeared to have been done.It is not that simple. The FIGC has to give the green light but has been virtually silent so far, and did not reply to requests from the  for information. It has transferred the competence for the final decision to the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale (TAR) of the Lazio area, a second-level court that resolves administrative matters. Essentially, the club believe, it is seeking recourse to TAR against the decision made by Coni.“This is affecting people’s jobs,” says Cleur, whose present contract will run on reduced terms if Entella are placed back in Serie C. “The budgets will be different and a lot of players would be on lower pay, have their contracts cancelled or even be released. And it’s not just the team, it’s the technical staff, the coaches, the people in the laundry, everyone.”Entella’s players discuss the situation among themselves in the dressing room every day, reminding one another not to drop their focus. Senior figures at the club have sat them down twice too but the point has arrived where there seems little left to say. “It’s more physical stuff we’re doing, like in pre-season, keeping yourself fit and sharp, but to not know when that is going to finish is taking its toll,” Cleur says. When Entella do begin playing again they will, regardless of ision, be obliged to play catch-up for several weeks both leagues have carried on without them and a regimen of Saturday-to-Wednesday fixtures puts them at an instant disadvantage. The feelings of frustration and anger stem from the fact that none of this is remotely their fault.“It’s ridiculous nobody wants to make an executive decision,” Cleur says, and that is why he and his teammates plan to converge on the FIGC’s headquarters in order “to show more of a presence, to push them to make the decision quicker.” Their rivals will be watching with interest: last week TAR rejected a joint appeal for instatement into Serie B, or at least a repechage, from Pro Vercelli, Novara, Ternana and Siena. It is unlikely that the last has been heard of their claims. Cleur believes Entella will take part in Serie B – “I honestly can’t see them putting us back in to Serie C, there’s no reason to stop our season and then do that” – but the odds are that, for nine more days, the agonising wait will go on.“Everybody I’ve spoken to or heard of is flabbergasted by the situation,” Cleur says. But he will train as usual on Monday the incentive of a place closer to Italy’s top flight is significant at this stage of his young career. Then, on that long trip to Rome, he will try to make sense of a chaotic state of affairs that reflects terribly on everybody except those it has affected the most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ea391a23ec2f2dd580eb618ac1a45a751e3983/0_78_3862_2317/master/3862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ead06f9202f0b68425756ab17bd37ff9","title":"olivier giroud goals chelsea","story":"There was a moment in Maurizio Sarri’s post‑match press conference on Saturday when, having eulogised Eden Hazard and spoken of the way he has challenged him to score 40 goals this season, the Chelsea manager was asked about the danger of being dependent on one player. Pedro and Willian, he replied, could score 10.Which is fair. Pedro has three league goals this season and Willian one. There is no reason at all why one, or both, couldn’t get up to double figures in all competitions (which was, Sarri had stressed, what he was talking about he was not anticipating Hazard scoring 40 in the league). But what he didn’t say seemed just as revealing. How many, you wonder, does he think Olivier Giroud and Alvaro Morata will muster this season?Giroud, at least, is making a virtue of his lack of goals. France, after all, have never won a World Cup when a centre-forward has scored a goal for them. In the summer, Giroud could claim to be the heir of Stéphane Guivarc’h – the non-goalscoring striker, the selfless team man whose movement and willingness to batter defenders and hold the ball up created space and opportunities for the sleeker players behind him. He was Serginho in 1982 with a better touch, or Flemming Povlsen in 1992 without the fairytale. The goalless striker who allowed his team to play.But it is one thing to do that in a tournament of six or seven games and another to carry that idea of a forward into a league season. Perhaps Giroud’s game is not one readily encapsulated by statistics. Stats do not measure movement out to the flank to draw defenders away and open up the diagonal for Hazard, they do not measure backward probing into a central defender, the clattering and battering that slowly wears them down. They measure goals and passes and assists and, on that measure, Giroud’s performance on Saturday is perhaps most generously described as minimalist.In the 64 minutes he spent on the pitch, Giroud touched the ball 18 times. A third of those touches were in his own half, only two in the Liverpool box. One of those was a header that went out of play halfway between the corners of the six- and 18-yard boxes. He attempted 14 passes, six of which found their intended recipient. He dribbled once and was offside once. He won four aerial duels. He didn’t make a tackle or an interception or block a shot of effect a clearance. Boiled down like that, it doesn’t sound like much. But Sarri seems happy enough. And at least with Giroud there is a sense that his goallessness doesn’t matter because he is fulfilling some greater purpose. With Alvaro Morata, who came on for him, there is the enduringly awkward sensation that he is a player who mislaid his confidence some time ago and has no idea how to get it back, even if he has at least scored this season.So long as Hazard is in this sort of form, perhaps it doesn’t much matter. Perhaps the best thing a Chelsea centre-forward can do at the moment is to get out of the way. Goals from wide areas, after all, are an increasingly important part of the modern game. As Alex Ferguson pointed out a decade ago, offering an explanation for his use of Wayne Rooney in wide areas that didn’t involve him acknowledging that Cristiano Ronaldo never tracks his full-back, it can be more dangerous for a forward to attack from out to in, rather than starting centrally and pulling wide in the search for space.Attacking on the diagonal is a way of creating acceleration room when space is tight, and often means a forward targeting a full-back on their weaker side. Giroud’s movement facilitates that and draws defenders away but there comes a point at which a centre-forward has to do more. All Chelsea forwards have to live in the shadow of two great predecessors. Both Didier Drogba and Diego Costa, in different ways, were adept at creating space for others, at hassling and harrying opponents, at winning aerials. Both of them did everything Giroud does effectively at least as well as he does, but both also scored goals.And, however you dress it up, whatever tactical schemes you may have, however charmingly quirky it may be for a centre-forward to play well and not score over a brief period, there does come a time when you need your striker to break a game open, steal a winner or salvage a point by pitting the ball in the net. Effective minimalism is what Daniel Sturridge did on Saturday: five minutes plus injury time played, one touch, one shot, one goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/decc4fb0c5b9810ab35a51de66fd0a80f74c486d/0_333_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39ed1dcb4f3edc7c8163a28c19b01588","title":"birmingham city v manchester city womens super league live","story":"What to make of that in the context of Man City’s season, though? Do they take it as a positive that they’ve come from 2-0 behind twice now to claim points, or is it a negative they were 2-0 down in the first place? Nick Cushing said before the game that they needed to get on the front foot from the start, but they most certainly didn’t do that and required a solid effort to come back. Still, three points is three points. Cracking game, that. Manchester City looked sluggish in the first-half but after their first goal were very solid and determined. That abysmal own-goal knocked them back for a while, but as the game progressed they got stronger and stronger. Birmingham, on the other hand, were too passive even before they went 2-0 up, so in some respects they had it coming. Still, after that second goal few would have predicted the final score. 90 mins + 2: The game just petering out a little now...90 mins + 1: Ladd tries to weave her way through the Man City defence, moving from the middle out wide. She hits a sort of cross-shot thing that briefly has Roebuck worried, but in the end she watches it go out for a goal-kick. 90 mins: Three minutes of added time: can Birmingham salvage something?88 mins: Out of basically nothing, Birmingham are nearly level.

Roebuck saves, and there might have been some post involved too. 87 mins: Berger almost makes a horrendous balls of a pass out, dragging a clearance straight to Weir. Mercifully for her, it was far enough away from the midfielder that she couldn’t do anything of note with it. 85 mins: Birmingham really haven’t been able to respond since the first Man City goal. The visitors are in entire control, and Weir feels emboldened to try an outrageous chip from well outside the box, but realistically it was never going to really work. Berger saves with ease. 82 mins: Change for Birmingham: Shania Hayles is on, Marissa Ewers is off. 80 mins: Man City have the ball in the net, but Emslie was about a light year offside. Still, it came from a Stanway cross who was played in by an absolutely delicious Walsh pass from deep. Almost deserved a goal on its own. 79 mins: Minor note: Birmingham manager Marc Skinner is wearing a Stone Island coat. Just because it works for Pep Guardiola Marc, doesn’t necessarily mean it will work for you...77 mins: Inches away from a fourth for Man City! Weir lines up a free-kick just to the right of centre, she curls it over the wall, beats Berger but it bangs against the inside of the post and out again! 75 mins: Stanway opens out her body on the left side of the area and tries to curl a shot into the far corner, but hits it straight at Berger. Man City want more here. 73 mins: Another large dollop of fortune, but they certainly have deserved the goals on the balance of play. Wullaert drives towards the edge of the box on the right, she shoots and the ball loops up off the behind of Harrop, and leaves Berger with no chance. 71 mins: Man City on the front foot now: Emslie wriggles free of some trouble in the box and cuts back to Walsh, but her shot is weak and blocked. The camera cuts to a man wearing a sky blue bucket hat in the crowd. Textbook. 67 mins: Subs for both teams: that’s Parris’s last action, as she’s withdrawn in favour of Claire Emslie, while for Blues Lucy Quinn replaces Mayling. 65 mins: City are level! Weir gets the ball just outside the box and is presented with a crowded area in front of her. But she shows some sensational close control to skip around three defenders, before squaring to Parris who has a simple task of sliding the ball into the bottom corner. It’s Nikita Parris’s goal but Weir did all the work. 63 mins: Wullaert tries a shot from way Downtown that we’ll file under ‘ambitious’. It scuttles along the floor and Berger saves easily. 60 mins: Scratch that controversy: Roebuck pretty skilfully managed to keep her arms out of the way, and in fact stopped the ball with her chest. 59 mins: A moment of controversy, perhaps: Wellings is brilliantly put through on goal, but Roebuck charges out of goal - outside of her area - to stop her. At first look she appeared to use her hands to do so, but the protests weren’t especially enthusiastic. 58 mins: This is an extremely generous interpretation of the goal...57 mins: Man City certainly have a bit more purpose to them now: a corner from the left is skimmed over nicely, and Berger has to palm it away from a few players waiting eagerly to head in the equaliser. 54 mins: Man City came back from 2-0 down last weekend and might be doing it again. The ball breaks out to Caroline Weir around the penalty spot, she shoots, it’s charged down by Ewers but it loops up in the air and although Berger gets a hand to it, she can’t stop it going in. Game on!Big deflection! But Man City are back in it!53 mins: Good chance for Man City, but Stanway wastes it: she cuts in from the right, reaches the byline with a couple of options for a cut-back, but instead she tries either a shot from an absurd angle or low cross that is easily cleared. 52 mins: Man City getting frustrated now? Ladd smartly wheels around on the halfway line, but Walsh sweeps her ankles away with a needless foul. She’s booked for it. 49 mins: Staniforth puts a corner over from the left, and Meaghan Sargeant gets up for the header at the back stick, then loops a perfectly-judged effort into the far corner, via a pleasing kiss of the post. Big problems for Man City now, particularly given their lack of options on the bench. And this time, entirely intentional! Change for Birmingham at half-time: Charlie Wellings is coming on, replacing Follis - could be an injury-enforced one, as Follis was on the rough end of a kicking a few times. The strains of ‘Feel It’ ring out again, which only means one thing: the second-half is about to get underway. Slightly odd half, that. Neither side have been especially good, separated only by that moment of high farce early on, Abbie McManus hoofing a pass from the opposition half back to her own keeper, who was beaten by the bounce. Actually, that might be a bit generous: for reasons best known to herself, Roebuck - comfortably in her area - tried to stop with her head rather than using her hands. Anyway, Man City have struggled to create anything of real note, but Birmingham have dropped back and seemed happy with their 1-0 lead. That could be dangerous if they continue the same approach after the break. Peeeeeeeeep! With the last kick of the half, Parris is set free behind the Birmingham defence after a mistake by Berger, but the keeper redeems herself by saving the shot. 45 mins + 2: Birmingham - who have looked troublingly passive for the last 20 minutes or so - give the ball away in midfield and are fortunate that Weir’s cross is poor, allowing Berger to nab it again. 45 mins: Stanway pops up on the right and tries to put a low cross into the ol’ corridor of uncertainty, but Berger - seemingly recovered from that bash to the ribs - comes out to claim easily. Three minutes of stoppage time. 44 mins: Man City still struggling to create anything. Wullaert has looked the most likely to spark anything creatively, and again she tries a big ball from the right. It’s cleared quite easily, but at least she’s trying something. 41 mins: Man City go close, close, close! That corner comes over from the right, Beattie gets up and meets the header, from which point the ball disappears into the thicket of legs in the six-yard box. It pops out after a brief scramble, and while a few players claim it had gone over the line, their appeals are turned down. The replay suggests that Staniforth just - just - managed to clear it off the line. 40 mins: Lordy, another injury: Jill Scott goes down this time, her ankle having taken a battering from - I think - the studs of Ewers. She gets back up and makes a decent run down the right, winning a corner, but she doesn’t look comfortable.39 mins: This does not look like a good laugh at all...36 mins: Great chance for Parris: terrific ball into the box by Walsh, which Parris takes down on her chest but the touch is a little heavy. Ann-Katrin Berger comes out to take both ball and player (fairly), but while Parris falls on that shoulder again, it’s Berger that needs treatment for what looks like a whack in the ribs. Like City they’ll be reluctant to make the sub, mind: Birmingham don’t have a keeper on the bench.

In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e82d37996babd34e7edd85cbf0e391ee929cf1f/0_325_4873_2924/master/4873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=083281202f0cb1755afcfffbb178f574","title":"could this be the last day of school west bank khan al ahmar","story":"After years of resisting Israeli demolition orders, a tiny village seen as vital to Palestine’s hopes of statehood faces destruction. But at the local school, it is still very much business as usualOn Monday morning, in the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, a few miles outside Jerusalem, the latest deadline for the community’s survival will expire.The most recent ultimatum was delivered to residents last Sunday by an Israeli government that has long pursued them through the courts. The villagers were told that they have until 1 October to demolish their homes and leave, following the rejection of a last-ditch appeal in Israel’s supreme court.First established in the early 1950s by members of a semi-nomadic tribe that the UN says was displaced from the Negev desert, Khan al-Ahmar was not recognised by Israel as a residential area following its occupation of the West Bank during the 1967 war. Since 2009, residents have been fighting demolition orders.Home to almost 180 people, Khan al-Ahmar – located in the occupied Palestinian territories – has long been a symbol of the plight of the Bedouin community, both in the occupied territories and Israel. The village has also become an embodiment of the prospects for a two-state settlement, with EU governments including the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain recently appealing to Israel once again not to demolish the village, warning of “the prospects of the two-state solution”.As the legal process has ground to an end, one focus has been Khan al-Ahmar’s school – known as the “tyre school” – built as a temporary structure out of about 2,000 discarded car tyres and clad in clay.But even as threats to demolish the community have escalated, learning has continued within the highly marginalised community, even on what might be the school’s last day.Photojournalist Quique Kierszenbaum, who has been reporting on the situation in Khan al-Ahmar for a decade, has visited several times amid the latest threat to the village and its school.“The kids are very aware of the situation. Some of them told me: ‘They’re going to destroy the school and the army is going to come’. You have a lot of activists visiting, including foreign activists, with people sitting in the playground of the school, where they used to play football.“But soon as they got into the school it was very normal. Which was surprising. Once classes started it was almost as if nothing was happening.“The feeling, after covering this for 10 years, is that there is always pressure and that the court could issue another pause. But it does feel like it may be near the end.“But at the school the feeling is yes, it might happen, but it is not happening today so we’ll just keep studying. We’re not going to stop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/951d5c3164a0888bc119a829677f4c75c731ab6c/0_537_8439_5066/master/8439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3991fae167c321ec0923f0c7d2d38e37","title":"a london flats smoke and mirrors trickery i like to seek out the unusual","story":"A giant glass cube gives a sci-fi twist to this London flat, partly reflecting its former resident Tom Baker, AKA the DoctorIt takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the black that wraps around the walls and ceilings of Linda Allen and Darin Brown’s flat, which occupies the ground floor of a Victorian redbrick in London’s Belsize Park. Then there’s the slightly disorientating effect of a wall of mirror glass between the living room and their bedroom. Except, this shiny expanse isn’t a wall at all. Linda and Darin got rid of that and replaced it with a glass-clad cube. “We wanted it to look as if a big shiny box had dropped down from outer space,” explains Linda. “We left a gap at the top and the bottom so it appears to hover, like a separate entity.”While the box-within-a-flat idea sprang from Linda’s imagination, the final structure is actually far more down-to-earth and useful. On the living-room side it provides deep storage for the TV, shelves of books and “the kind of stuff that everyone has, but doesn’t want to look at every day,” as Linda puts it. On the bedroom side, mirrored doors conceal a utility area with washing machine and dryer and then an en suite, lined, naturally, in yet more mirror glass.Linda came up with the design ideas for their flat so it fell to her to try to explain this box-within-a-flat idea to their architect, Roger Crimlis of Architect Your Home. “In the end, I climbed inside our old wardrobe, crouched down and said: ‘Imagine something like this but bigger, so it’s a whole separate room.’ Then, he got it and ran with the idea,” she says.Even before their big glass box landed, Linda and Darin were drawn towards less conventional finishes for their home. When they had the ramshackle extension at the back of the ground-floor flat rebuilt as a dining area, they stipulated that the building materials – black steel beams, gritty concrete and bare brickwork – were left exposed rather than plastered over. “When designing our place, I wanted a raw, unfinished feel,” says Linda. Rather than hanging pictures directly on to the bare concrete wall, paintings are suspended with wires and strong magnets attached to the steel beams.In the living room there’s more rough brickwork, partnered with lots of wooden panelling, all painted in matt black (Hudson Black by Abigail Ahern). The couple also added further architectural elements – plinths, pillars and corbels – that peep out from the shadowy corners of their home.The smoke and mirrors trickery of this flat hasn’t always been Linda and Darin’s style. The couple met in their native Canada and lived in the US and Paris before settling in London seven years ago, where Darin works in digital marketing and Linda is an artist and interior designer. “All our homes have been different but tended towards a minimalist white look,” says Linda. “The feel of this one was inspired by the building itself and its Victorian architecture.”When they first moved to the UK, Linda and Darin did the “tourist thing” of visiting historic manor houses at weekends. “I especially liked ones with lots of dark corners, secret doors and hidden servants’ staircases,” says Linda. As a tribute to that tradition, she worked a hidden WC into the design of this home. “It’s behind the panelling by the front door. Once you know it’s there you can see the joins in the woodwork, but otherwise you wouldn’t guess it was there,” she says.Further inspiration came from the discovery that a former inhabitant of the flat had been the actor Tom Baker, who played Dr Who in the 1970s. “Having the presence of Dr Who wafting around in the ether gave me some extra creative licence,” says Linda, gesturing to the Tardis-like panelling and the spider-from-Mars chandelier. “We’re paying tribute to the house’s past.”Linda and Darin have added yet more atmosphere by furnishing their flat with vintage finds. “I like to seek out the unusual – things that other people might overlook or not see the beauty in,” says Linda. “At an auction, at the point when most bidders lose interest and the room goes quiet, that’s when I perk up.” Their latest finds include several vintage paintings, a war-time campaign desk and the set of replica terracotta warrior busts lined up in their bedroom.The weathered and peeling wall cabinet in the kitchen is another vintage find (from a tailor’s shop), while the island is a former haberdashery counter. The neat compartments are now used for cutlery, jars of spices… and a row of fluorescent tennis balls for dog walks. The copper sink – visible from all angles thanks to the counter’s glass sides – was bought by Darin on a trip to Florida and the taps are vintage American. “I wanted to work antique storage into this area because a kitchen deserves interesting pieces, too,” says Linda.Linda originally trained in industrial design and worked as a footwear designer for brands such as Adidas, Nike, Dr Martens and Hunter, but now concentrates on her own art and interiors. “I’ve always been able to visualise things in 3D,” she says. “Even when I was little I was fascinated by boxes and would stack them together to make bigger structures. This flat is a super-sized, shiny version of my childhood games.”See Linda’s interior design work at madforsquirrels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4619a08bdfb602500e82ce0daf14721244657314/0_117_3426_2055/master/3426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=984108870785e8a279d825a083e52814","title":"how a simple night in with friends went horribly wrong","story":"My first adult gathering since my son’s birth started off badly when I shushed my guests at the front door and made them take off their shoes in case they woke himAn effort was made. My wife had gone out and I actively pursued company for my night in. Called people, even. This was pretty big the first adult-oriented gathering since the baby. In fact, the first in a while – even before my wife was pregnant, I was socialising less and less. Having spent my childhood in a madhouse with 10 other children – my siblings – I gravitated to even larger gatherings in my 20s. Then I was never happier than in the pummelling crush of a warehouse rave, charging through damp thickets of shoulder sweat to find the venue’s hot, beating heart.Nowadays, that prospect is as palatable as being waterboarded. Some nagging sense persists that my weary steps and stolen yawns would betray me as an interloper, one younger patrons would regard from afar. Like tenant farmers glimpsing their reclusive lord, they would spy my harrowed form and wonder what mysterious business urged this strange old coot to withdraw from public life.Hosting, too, has become infrequent. Visits to meet the baby are common enough hour-long pop-ins where we chat about his sleep patterns over tea and swiss roll. But not those visits of yore, when treasured friends showed up, half pissed, so you could loudly row about provisional driving licences, over a fancy box of wine.Before Charlie and Dave arrived, I put the boy to bed and noted how little he or I had slept in the preceding days. Then the doorbell rang and I found myself glaring at them on the threshold, telling them to be quiet and demanding – with a fury I hadn’t anticipated – that they take off their shoes.All good hosting begins with making your guests hyper-aware of each sound they make, not least because those sounds are then rendered deafeningly loud in the awkward silence you’ve engendered. And so it was that, straining every muscle in our legs, we couldn’t have made more noise as they came in if we’d been playing rugby in Victorian ing suits.For my guests, the evening must have had all the bracing excitement of arriving too early at your friend’s house and having to wait downstairs in the company of their taciturn gran. Had you been a fly on the wall, you’d have witnessed one wiry insomniac and two scared mutes, sitting metres apart, in near silence. Of course, had you been a fly on the wall, I also would’ve asked if you could rub your legs together a bit quieter.When I texted to apologise the following day, they said they greatly enjoyed their evening of panicked tedium, and being evicted at 10pm was a boon for their commute. My dream of a casual night-in with pals may have been dashed, but these are baby steps. Soon we’ll be back to the good old days and invites will go out. I’ll provide the wine – but would it kill you to take off your shoes?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5516f8ea194802a7e29f954cf6321624f45ecd/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a71c4693685ec78975f822a833c26f","title":"i want to get married but my partner wont go through it again mariella frostrup","story":"Your partner’s intransigence is unfair – but start by examining your own motives, Mariella Frostrup tells a woman who says she’s ‘always wanted to be a wife’The dilemma My partner and I have been together for three years, have a child together and are trying for a second. He was married before he met me and his orce was nasty and dragged on for years. It wasn’t finalised until just after the birth of our child. I desperately want to be married, but he does not. I have told him it’s not a deal-breaker – and it isn’t. Marriage does not make a family and us not being married doesn’t mean we don’t love each other any less. He has said that marriage is a big deal and I should respect the reality of what he’s been through.I can’t really explain why I want it so badly, but I can’t help it. I’ve always wanted to be married, to be a wife, to wear the dress, etc. It eats me up inside that he gave some other woman this commitment but not me, the mother of his child. I feel I’m being selfish and I probably am, but every time the conversation arises I feel hurt. I love this man and want to spend my life with him. Can I have the happily ever after even if we never get married?Mariella replies You know the answer to that. Marriage is no guarantee of future happiness as any bitter orcee will attest. Outside your partner’s experience you’ll find plenty more examples of the emptiness of the “till death do us part” promise. Like love itself, our desire to make it official doesn’t stand up to rational scrutiny. I’m sure you know plenty of unmarried couples who negotiate their unrestricted union just fine and plenty of married ones who should be separated for their own safety. That doesn’t mean I don’t have sympathy for your cause. At it’s best, getting hitched is about both of you publicly declaring your commitment to each other and, for some of us, that matters a whole lot more than it probably should. As with religion, an institution like marriage relies on our insecurities for its survival. The fact it’s available as a choice to be made, or a goal to be achieved, has the effect of making us covet marital status.Your partner has experienced the worst of this romantic merry-go-round and its aftermath so it would be rather worrying if he was eager to return to that situation. That doesn’t mean he’s in the right, just that his reaction is understandable. As I’m sure you’ve reminded him, it’s not the institution of marriage that broke up his last relationship but whatever incompatibilities or issues he and his ex failed to resolve. Much as I don’t approve of our blind devotion to a perhaps outmoded way of getting the world to respect our relationship, neither do I believe it has disruptive powers unless we bring them with us.You have every right to feel undervalued, not by his preference not to marry again at present but by him telling you that it’s because it’s a “big deal”! I’m sure he meant it benignly, but there is something irksome about a partner suggesting that publicly swearing eternal devotion is a bigger hurdle than having a child together. You are jointly responsible for a new life and if that’s not the biggest deal, then he’s got his priorities misplaced. His excuse for not offering you a ceremony, the illusion of security and, more importantly, the rights, inheritance and everything else that come with “tying the knot” (interesting language in that metaphor) is not convincing.What you can do about his intransigence is another matter. Understanding your own motives would be a good place to start. Your reasons for wanting to be married are as irrational as his are for not. I suspect that approaching the topic more logically might give you a better hearing. You need to close that distance between you with some sensible thinking. This isn’t a competition between you and his ex wife – you’ve already won that battle conclusively by becoming a family, so stop comparing your situation to hers.The more you make your heart’s desire sound like a calculated move to gain territory on your opponent, the less appealing it sounds – particularly to someone who has run the gamut of love turned sour. Slipping a ring on a lover’s finger is the easiest expression of devotion to enact bringing another life into the world and living up to your role as a parent, one of the hardest. If it’s commitment you feel you’re being denied, then look at your child’s face. There’s no greater manifestation of love than choosing to make a baby together.I suspect your problem may just be one of timing. It has only been three years and it sounds like a large part of your time together has been taken up with a bitter orce battle followed by your pregnancy. That’s quite a lot to be preoccupied with. Why don’t you try to enjoy the fact you’ve found each other and focus on the family you are building. If you genuinely mean it isn’t a deal-breaker, then don’t make it one.Life is long and everything is up for grabs – just not always at the moment we desire it. If confirming responsibilities in the eyes of the law is partly your motivation, there’s always a civil partnership. If it’s white lace you’re chasing (thanks Joni M), then you need a better reason to pursue it than to achieve equal status with his ex-wife."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76fd0c60b3ee5b796b9e1cc68d955cedde552a32/0_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eefe3c77f35fe5814d4c47a85fb2f82f","title":"the local community website that is right up your street nextdoor","story":"From lost dogs to wild garlic and the desperate need for a top tiler, nextdoor lets you peak behind the curtains of your neighboursA dog is roaming our street, barking away.” Every evening after brushing my teeth, I get into bed and explore my new neighbourhood. “Some people are now scared of coming out as they may be attacked. The dog is beige in colour.” To walk through nextdoor at night is to map not just my local streets but its minds, minds that appear to flip fairly evenly between lost pets and new bathrooms, with regular loo breaks for paranoia. I love it. And what’s more, it makes me love them, love it, my new home, where Laughter Therapy is now available in the scout hut for the special price of £10, and foxes scream at night.It’s a year since we moved in – we discovered this only when the house’s previous owner texted to say happy anniversary. I should have realised, the light is the same. There is this brightness that we didn’t get in the city, a lowness of sun that causes shadows the length of the M1. Walking to school in the morning takes twice as long as it should because my daughter wants to wait for the shadows to catch up. She’s just started in reception, but it doesn’t feel entirely new, as it’s the school that I went to, and my sister, and my dad – I keep waiting for the rush to come, the hit of nostalgia that will leave me gasping against a wall, but nothing yet. Everything is in place to make me cry – on her first day two weeks ago, each parent was sent away with a small plastic bag, inside which was a teabag, a toffee, a poem and a tissue, for the tears. The equivalent of, having scratched you with a nail, offering a little sachet of salt for the wound. Still I didn’t cry.She is in the classroom below the one where Katie showed me how to hide in the pretend oven to avoid a teacher looking for a rogue poo in someone’s pants, and there’s the playground where I would be She-Ra between the hours of 12 and one, and the hall smells the same, wood polish and crayons, and the toilets are tiny, for bottoms the size of perhaps a bagel, and still, no tears. All I feel is a raw sense of joy at the relentless circularity of time, seen in this low yellow light, which I expel in noisy hellos to strangers’ babies.In his often-quoted book Bowling Alone, social analyst Robert Putnam looked at the decline in membership of churches, trade unions, and 10-pin bowling leagues, linking social involvement to quality of life. He concluded that the internet had encouraged a breakdown in both. I would refer him today to Nextdoor, where, in the US it’s been reported, one neighbour donated an organ to the person 10 doors down, and a shocking camaraderie is visible simply in the plumbing recommendations.It reveals as much as it accommodates. On my local page, I monitored a full and frank debate about the effect of immigration that sat underneath a blurry photo of a family picking wild garlic. There’s a stretch of woodland just north of here that, every spring, is carpeted with garlic. You can smell it from the tube station, green and piercing, and we collect it in plastic bags and eat it with chicken. But one neighbour, seeing a family picking, he believed, more than their fair share, posted their details on Nextdoor, “after the police said they weren’t interested”.And so began a thread three streets wide, about these people coming over here and stealing our weeds, and the politics of sharing, and how much garlic was too much. It reflected something I noticed during the local elections, when council candidates pointed out the changes between those settling down in the suburbs today compared with their parents’ generation. While 30 years ago, couples saved up to move to the suburbs, buying a house and voting right, today’s housing crisis means there are more people like me who come dragging our feet, bringing our politics with us. In this thread on Nextdoor, the conservatives were debating with the less so’s, and all in the shadow of posts about a new holistic healing workshop and whether or not to report a suspicious van.Part of the beauty of this website is that I can engage on my own terms, ie eating cereal braless with a sheetmask on. But mainly, its value is as a gentle democratiser, bringing together neighbours at the top of a highrise with a sprawling family down by the park, those whose role it is to soothe the woman who posts daily warnings of distant crimes, and those that will absolutely burst if they don’t recommend a good tiler. These have become my bedtime stories, the badly spelt desires of people in my postcode, the domestic chatter that hovers one floor up, and it adds a dull but glorious texture to my Aldi shop, to my walk to school, these maps of items wanted: “Retirement flat for quick sale” “Trying desperately to find a man called Des” “Missing Dog  found dead”.It’s the 50th anniversary of the country hit Harper Valley PTA, pop’s best ever response to slut-shaming, and my favourite song as a ball-breaking child. The song’s lyrics tell of a snooty PTA letter written to one Mrs Johnson, accusing her of ‘drinkin and runnin round with men and goin wild’. So our heroine replies by listing their hypocrisies one by one ‘...And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?’ Soundtrack of 2018.My favourite scandal this week: the ongoing debate about the sexuality of Sesame Street’s Ernie and Bert. On one side, they weren’t written that way, on the other, well, so what, they helped spread acceptance of same-sex relationships. And on the third side, all puppets are gay so there.Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c143be8edef27b3166acda1e7f68f386980201bf/0_546_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc8ee227d160d8c09e3f770345c0d57d","title":"the slow pleasures and melancholy of autumn gardening","story":"Fading light and failing growth brings its own beauty to the gardenSo the autumn equinox is over, October mere hours away.

I watch the slowing of September seed now sluggish in its growth. Plants that surged only a month or so before are struggling a little more.There is beauty here in fading. The garden failing, falling. Sunflowers swooning, drooping amaranth over, once-pink seed heads rusting like abandoned tractors in the rain.Even the nasturtiums are surrendering. Their grasp almost arthritic on the sweet pea poles. Soon they’ll be a mess of ghostly tendrils undone by overnight frost. I’ll gather them and carry their corpses to the compost. I’ll collect and dry the seed, though it is unnecessary. They’ll burst through in the spring without human help.Coriander is coming, hardy chervil, too, Japanese mustards, pak choi and tatsoi.

Many big social media companies issued advice but did nothing to enforce it, he said.“The terms of reference of Facebook and Instagram say you shouldn’t be on it if you are under the age of 13. But they do nothing to police that. The guidelines for WhatsApp say you shouldn’t be on it unless you’re 16. But again, they don’t lift a finger.”Concern is also growing in government and medical circles about the effect of “recreational” screen use on children’s ability to learn and acquire knowledge. A study published last week in the Lancet Child \u0026amp Adolescent Health, based on a survey of children in the US, found higher levels of cognition in children whose “recreational screen time” was less than two hours a day.A report for Ofcom last year found that children aged between five and 15 in Britain spent an average of 15 hours a week online and half of 12-year-olds had a social media profile.In academic circles, debate continues over whether social media has more negative than positive effects.The use of mobile technologies such as smartphones had, it said, also been linked to anxieties about conforming with social norms and the need for “likes” – external validation of personal content posted online.However it concluded that because young people were increasingly conducting their lives online, it would probably be “futile” to attempt to protect children and young people from all online risks.“This indicates that the focus of public policy should be on how to develop resilience in young people to maintain their emotional and mental wellbeing and live safe digital lives.”Some tech companies have recognised that parents need control over how much time their children are spending online. Apple has introduced a new “screen time” feature that allows parents to restrict the amount of time children spend in front of their screens online. Facebook recently introduced a number of new tools to help users manage their time on Facebook and Instagram.These include an activity dashboard showing average time spent on each app, a daily reminder to give users an alert when they have reached the amount of time they want to spend on that app, and a new way to limit notifications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04504c2e1c92a86a3eb4b6b76ade3f9c35651432/0_103_5826_3497/master/5826.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83abc293e18151388bcfc284352cf901","title":"daily mirror brexit tightrope labour split second eu vote","story":"Where does the Daily Mirror stand on Brexit? Since February 2016, when the then prime minister, David Cameron, announced the date for the EU referendum, it has been fascinating to monitor the way in which the paper has downplayed its belief in the virtues of remain.The reason? While the Mirror, going back to the 1960s, has been consistently pro-EU, its editors are aware that a great swathe of its largely northern-based working-class readership is known to be antipathetic to the EU.So throughout the campaign leading up to the vote, it stuck to its pledge “to cover the debate with an objectivity absent in the din generated by fanatics”. Its leading articles favoured remain, as did its political columnist Kevin Maguire, who countered the Brexiters’ “project fear” mantra by rightly calling their campaign claims “project fib”.But the Mirror’s overall coverage was low-key. It did not fight the remain corner with anything like the passion and commitment evident among the pro-leave titles. Unless it wished to antagonise a large slice of its audience, it had little choice but to sit on the fence.It greeted the referendum result by urging “reconciliation rather than recrimination” after, according to the Mirror’s editor, Alison Phillips, its readers voted “by a fairly small margin” in favour of remain. Maybe. I am assuming that’s a guesstimate, but I think it fair to assume it was close to the mark and explains why she also says Brexit “has been really tricky for us”. It has also proved tricky for the Labour party.There, of course, is the other major headache for the Mirror. For the best part of 70 years it has been Fleet Street’s most loyal supporter of the Labour party and became a fervent cheerleader for Tony Blair’s New Labour. Now, with Blair’s nemesis, Jeremy Corbyn, as leader, the paper has tried to avoid raining on his parade by refusing to condemn his radical agenda while daring to criticise him when it thinks appropriate, such as his failure to act more swiftly and effectively over accusations of antisemitism.To deal with the deep schism among its readers over Brexit and to negotiate Labour’s bitter internal struggle Phillips has had to turn into a journalistic tightrope walker, a tough act for any editor, but especially so in a red-top tabloid that has traded in the past on political single-mindedness. (I know that all too well because it was the case when I edited the Mirror almost 30 years ago.)How then does Phillips perform her double feat of funambulism? In a Media Masters podcast interview last week, when asked if there is a Daily Mirror view of Brexit, she wobbled slightly, but there was no hint of falling off.She stressed that the paper, despite its remain sympathies, had refused to adopt “a narrative where leavers are demonised as racist, stupid and parochial”. She claimed to understand why people voted to leave, asserting that “populism was fuelled by people who felt they were ignored”.Her concern throughout recent months, she said, has been to avoid what she deems the “elite thinking” that the masses are bigoted, unkind and vulgar. “It is vital that we enable their voices and views to be heard,” she said, “because they find their home in the Mirror.”This acceptance of the leave voters’ beliefs has made Phillips cautious about supporting calls for a new referendum. “We are very nervous about a second vote,” she said. That nervousness is evident in the paper’s avoidance of the issue. Instead, it has chosen to concentrate its fire on rightwing Tories, such as Boris Johnson, who favour a hard Brexit or the no-deal option.An editorial two weeks ago about “the Brexit fiasco” was scathing about Theresa May’s “discredited Chequers proposals” and demanded new thinking in the negotiations, but it made no reference to the insistent calls for another vote. Similarly, after EU leaders rejected May’s plans, the paper reiterated the need for the referendum result to be respected, which happens to have been Corbyn’s long-held position.Last week, during the Labour party conference, there were signs, albeit reluctant, of a change of direction by the Labour leader. These had been signalled in Maguire’s column in which he pointed to the wisdom of Corbyn supporting a second referendum. However, no leading Mirror article touched on the subject. As with all papers, its print audience is dwindling, but it has no wish to hasten the desertion by telling half its current 558,457 buyers that they should vote on EU membership all over again.Jumping across to Phillips’s other tightrope, coping with the Labour party ision, she has managed to keep her paper faithful to Corbyn. She concedes there are “issues that ide the two sides of the party” but believes there is “still a lot that unites them”.She said, adopting a familiar partisan position: “The first thing we always keep in the front and centre of our mind is that a Tory government is bad for our readers because they’ve been on the wrong end of austerity for 10 years … A Labour government would be good for them.”If that sounds wishy-washy, she would say that, wouldn’t she. Phillips actually goes further by scorning the Blair “project” as “too slick and too professional”. In her view, that was a major contribution to “ordinary people” (AKA Mirror readers) turning away from politics.“There is something to be said for a bit of reality, for authenticity. That’s what Jeremy Corbyn offers,” she said. “What we need is a popular left in both print and politics, a sense that we understand real people’s lives, we talk like they do, we shop in the shops they shop in, we know what normal people are thinking and feeling.”On Friday came yet another reminder about the Mirror’s particular concern for its circulation heartland. After it was revealed that the government spent £40,000 trying to conceal how rarely its northern powerhouse minister, James Wharton, visited the north of England, the paper contended that “the Tories’ commitment to the north has always been skin deep”. It said: “If Wharton had spent more time there, he would have realised how it is starved of funds compared with the south.”There, in a couple of sentences, is the reality Phillips is seeking to address. It may be based in London, its senior editorial staff may want to remain in the EU and it may not be wholeheartedly behind Corbyn, but it must not cut itself off from a readership that lives outside the capital, favours Brexit and is keen to give Corbyn a try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2a0a50d54d51bf111bd2cb1589d70528452a61b/0_177_4424_2654/master/4424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de758950bcbb3cd697d5b4feef3440b7","title":"salome review strauss english national opera","story":"Coliseum, LondonAdena Jacobs floods her stage with blood in an English National Opera re-imagining that cannot quite live up to its early intrigueOperatic history is dominated by male narratives of female sexuality, none of them more confrontational, perhaps, than Strauss’s Salome, in which transgressive love turns fatally obsessive and can only find eventual consummation in necrophilia. To open a season that promises, to quote artistic director Daniel Kramer, an exploration of “the patriarchal structures, relationships and roles of masculinity within our society”, English National Opera is presenting a new staging by the Australian director Adena Jacobs, whose work is rooted in reimagining the classics from a radical, contemporary and feminine perspective. Jacobs’ thesis – and few would disagree – is that Salome can only express and fulfil her desires in terms of the objectifying male constructs with which she has been brought up. Whether Jacobs adequately realises her concept is a different matter.Her staging sets it out wonderfully well. Armed men stand beneath a tank, in which a naked body floats – whether it is male or female is unclear. Our instinctive desire is to ascertain the figure’s gender, which is Jacobs’ cue to draw us into voyeuristic complicity with what immediately follows. Allison Cook’s androgynous Salome emerges, pale and nervous, from behind the soldiers as Stuart Jackson’s Narraboth nervously twists an ominously bloodied handkerchief between his fingers. The subsequent encounter with David Soar’s Jokanaan is riddled with tension. A camera attached to a muzzle placed over Soar’s face projects an image of his mouth on to the backcloth, which turns from black-and-white to colour as Salome’s fascination grows. Cook’s explicit expressions of desire render her alarmingly vulnerable, but Narraboth transforms them into pornography by filming her every move.When Michael Colvin’s neurotic Herod and Susan Bickley’s haggard Herodias arrive, however, the tension evaporates and the production founders into a stream of hallucinatory images that disrupt narrative continuity and dramatic focus. The images can be both unsettling and banal, though they fail to cohere into a meaningful whole. Colvin slips and slithers in Narraboth’s blood, which the Jews have unavailingly tried to wash from the floor. A decapitated pink pony is strung up, its entrails turning into flowers as they spill from its body (blood and flowers soon become interchangeable in ways reminiscent of the works of Jean Genet).The dance, in which Cook laconically strikes a series of provocative poses while four dancers gyrate round her, is genuinely chilling, though Jacobs never re-establishes the tension of the opening scenes in the escalation into nightmare that follows, and the ending is curiously anticlimactic.Cook is a mezzo rather than the more usual soprano, which means she compensates for the lack of a genuine high pianissimo with some unsettling phases in those dark lower registers to which Strauss makes his heroine frequently descend. But she’s a fine vocal actor, immersing herself in the role with admirable commitment and abandon. Jokanaan lies high for Soar, and his voice is overamplified when he’s singing in his underground prison, though Colvin and Bickley are superb. She wonderfully suggests Herodias’s fraying dignity. He sounds all the more sinister for singing so elegantly and refusing to shout, like so many Herods. Martyn Brabbins conducts with great intensity, his interpretation gathering strength as it goes. The ENO Orchestra play outstandingly for him, with every shift in colour beautifully realised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c41fdf45df762caddc03f2e21c2673ed08abb4/1988_1380_5625_3375/master/5625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86ae39e65fe4804a851c212cd9d8d7b0","title":"what happened when jeff goldblum met jay rayner interview","story":"One is a food critic, the other a Hollywood star … so what happened when they played jazz together?Jeff Goldblum has huge hands. I know this because we are finger to finger at the keyboard of a Steinway grand piano in a glitzy central London hotel lobby, and he easily outs my meaty paws. We are working our way through Herbie Hancock’s classic jazz tune Cantaloupe Island, the myriad heavy silver rings on his long fingers flashing under the lights as he takes a solo. If you want to get properly up close and personal with someone, play a piano duet with them. He hums the tune under his breath and rocks his shoulders into me as he plays. When it’s my turn to solo, he somehow manages to wrap his broad, 6ft 4in leather-jacketed frame around me to throw in some bass stabs down the bottom of the keyboard. He grins and laughs. Jeff Goldblum is in the room. And he’s enjoying himself.No wonder. Goldblum the film star, the one who misplaced his mantra in Woody Allen’s Annie Hall, who gave us all nightmares as he gene-spliced himself with an insect in David Cronenberg’s The Fly and battled aliens in Independence Day, is about to release his first jazz piano album, and he can’t quite believe his luck. “I’m grateful for the whole damn thing,” he tells me.Our duet took place following an hour’s conversation at another keyboard tucked away in a bar, off the lobby of the Corinthia Hotel in London. Goldblum says he knows this instrument, a clunky electronic piano tackily set into the bar. “I’ve played it before. When I’m on the road I go early in the morning to a local jazz club or a piano like this and I run through my stuff.” He plays his way through 40 key jazz standards to keep them up to scratch. He’s done it for years. “At 5.30 this morning I was in the lobby playing on that lovely Steinway. I am nothing if not disciplined.”That’s the point. Through all the films, the huge grossers like Jurassic Park and Thor: Ragnarok, the cult classics like The Big Chill or Earth Girls Are Easy, through three marriages and his 65 years, playing jazz piano has been the constant. “I purposefully kept it under the radar,” he says. “I always wanted to be an actor. But playing the piano, that was never a career. I was doing it for fun and the joy of it and, you know, seeing how far it goes.”In October last year, Goldblum appeared on The Graham Norton Show plugging his scene-stealing part in Thor: Ragnarok as a hedonistic, manipulative Master of the Universe to be fair, Goldblum’s rarely met a scene he couldn’t thieve. “The producers for Graham Norton called and said Gregory Porter, who I think is great, was to be the musical guest. Would I like to accompany him? And I said, ‘Very much, yes I would.’”For many viewers, who didn’t know that Goldblum is a musician with his own ensemble and weekly LA club date, the moment came as a surprise. It is, to be fair, not the most comfortable of performances. Goldblum is stooped over the piano and leaning into the sheet music like it’s an exam he thinks he might fail, though he relaxes a little as he slips into a solo full of flurries and tight corners. “I was reading the hell out of that piece,” he says now. “I’d really only done it a couple of times.”Tom Lewis, head of A\u0026ampR at Decca Records in London, watched the show. “I think somewhere in my peripheral memory I was aware Jeff played, but the trigger really was that performance.” He later flew to Los Angeles, took in one of Goldblum’s shows at the Rockwell club with his ensemble, the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra – named after a friend of his late mother’s in Pittsburgh – and signed him for an album. “I was really impressed. He’s very accomplished, but he’s also exceedingly respectful to other musicians,” Lewis says. “What he’s really good at is being a band leader. There’s a little bit of the Count Basie swagger to him.”The result, recorded live with an audience at the legendary Capitol Studios, is a blast. There’s no doubting its jazz credentials. For a start it’s produced by Larry Klein, who has worked with Herbie Hancock and Joni Mitchell. It kicks off with Cantaloupe Island and finishes with Duke Ellington’s Caravan. There’s a haunting trumpet solo by the world-class German trumpeter Till Brönner on It Never Entered My Mind, but also huge crowd pleasers.Imelda May gives a brilliantly gravelly rendition of Nat King Cole’s Straighten Up and Fly Right there’s a blissful take on Nina Simone’s My Baby Just Cares for Me with vocals by Haley Reinhart, and Goldblum duets and flirts with Sarah Silverman on Me and My Shadow. “We’re not asking to be compared to contemporary virtuosos,” Goldblum says of the recording. “We’re not trying to impress anybody. We’re just saying, ‘Have a listen to this and see if you like it.’”The result is indeed very likable. For the most part he’s not the star soloist, just the pianist in a cracking outfit. Compared with the myriad albums by other actors and comedians attempting to prove they’ve got soul by over-stretching their mediocre musical skills, it’s that rare creature: an un-vanity project. And the man can really play. I suggest it’s odd that, after 30 years of shows in the US, he should end up being signed by an A\u0026ampR man from London. “Yes,” he says. “It’s random. It’s magical.”Jeff Goldblum grew up in Pittsburgh with three siblings, a mother who had worked in radio, a doctor father and a Steinway grand piano. “It was just there,” he says, when I express surprise at such an illustrious instrument. “I think it was an investment.” Both his parents loved music and theatre and insisted the kids took dance and music lessons. Goldblum was a poor classical student. “I had some co-ordination, but no discipline and I dreaded the lessons because I hadn’t touched the piano all week.”So what changed? What was the tune he learned that made him realise there was another way? All of us who turn to jazz piano have one of those: a tune that sends us down a new road. “Oh, oh,” he says, in that perfect Goldblum half stutter, the sound of an idea coming to him faster than his mouth can handle. “It was called Ally Cat.” He plays me the first few bars of something caught between ragtime and barrelhouse, full of stride piano left-hand chords, his long fingers flicking this way and that. “I went, ‘Wait a minute, wait a minute…’” – he is playing the part of himself when young. “I don’t care how long it takes me to play like that. It’s what I want to play.”He began reading his way through chord sheets for tunes from the Great American Songbook, songs like Stairway to the Stars, Deep Purple and Misty and paid close attention to Pittsburgh’s own jazz piano star, Erroll Garner. “I’m not really sure how I learned about playing chords, but somehow I did.” As with everything on planet Goldblum, he makes it sound effortless. At 14, he grabbed a phone book and called local bars explaining he’d heard they were looking for a pianist. It was a lie he didn’t even know whether they had a piano. Unsurprisingly most of them didn’t have a vacancy, but a couple booked him. Well of course they did.Remarkably, his parents drove him to the gigs. He makes it sound like a reasonable thing for a parent to do with their 14-year-old son. “Even though my parents were conventional in many ways, they had a love of music. They would check out the bar, make sure it was OK and leave me to it.”But acting was still the career of choice. At 17 he moved to New York, bought an upright piano for his apartment and took acting lessons from a renowned coach, Sanford Meisner. His approach, Goldblum says, was also useful for his development as a musician. “He taught me that acting is interactive. You come to life out of your presence with the other actors, by listening. I come from the era of ensemble acting, all those Robert Altman films.” To play with other musicians you also have to listen. The problem was that he had never played with anyone else.That changed through working with the actor Peter Weller (who would eventually make his name in RoboCop) on the film Buckaroo Banzai. Weller plays trumpet and had been encouraged by sometime clarinet player Woody Allen to start performing. “Peter Weller suggested we do something and I knew a guitarist so we started playing at this brunch place on Sunset Boulevard.” That was 30 years ago. Weller has moved on but the music hasn’t stopped. “Now every week when I’m in town we get together and play.” Only when they were offered bigger gigs at festivals and the Hollywood Bowl did they finally settle on a name. “Apparently we needed one.” Dear old Mildred Snitzer was accorded her moment in the sun, for an “orchestra” that rarely goes beyond seven or eight members.I ask him to play me something, and he goes into the lovely Jules Styne and Sammy Cahn tune I Fall in Love Too Easily. Despite the limitations of the instrument we’re on – the amplified sound comes out of a speaker behind us, which is just plain odd for a piano – his version is soft and lyrical. He throws in a vocal at the end. Does he like singing? “Oh sure, I like to sing. I like to do all of it.” Until relatively recently his weekly shows were, he says, random events. “I’d bring fake books” – volumes of chord sheets for well-known tunes – “and start flicking through and get the audience to tell me to stop and whatever it was we’d play. I like to cold read.” A few years ago one of his band members told him that he ought to talk to the audience more. “And I thought he was right so I started going out 30 minutes before and playing word games with the audience.”You can find grainy video snippets of those shows online. What’s most striking is just how completely Jeff Goldblum he is. It’s the same today here in the bar. He is exceptionally comfortable in his own tall, imposing skin. For such a star, he’s brilliant at the tricky business of being himself. He is a superb Jeff Goldblum, the Jeff Goldblum you want him to be – intense, amused, interested – and yet he manages it without being smug or overbearing. When it came to recording the album, that presented challenges. “Larry Klein came to see the show at the Rockwell and he immediately said that if we put Jeff in a sterile studio, it wouldn’t work,” says Tom Lewis from Decca. “We had a choice. For the sake of the record do you take microphones to the Rockwell or do you take the Rockwell into the studio?” They went for the latter, importing the whole club into Capitol Studios, where Sinatra and Nat King Cole recorded.Next Klein turned to the tunes. “Larry said, ‘What’s your identity?’” says Goldblum. “So we settled on the 1950s60s Blue Note stuff.” Originally this included a lot of difficult material by Thelonious Monk, which he plays through to me. “Do you know this one? Or this one? Or this?” I admit I don’t. They’re tricky tunes. Clearly Klein decided the listener might feel the same way, because none of them made the cut.Goldblum admits the process has changed him as a piano player. “It’s made me focus on what I’m doing.” He is now taking lessons from fellow band members. I ask if he regrets not having spent time on these basics when he was much younger. “Oh no. No, no, no. That’s how it worked out for me. Maybe if I’d burdened myself, I wouldn’t be having as much fun as I am now. I’m kind of a late bloomer.”In 2014 Goldblum, previously married to the actors Patricia Gaul and Geena Davis, married the former Canadian Olympic gymnast Emilie Livingston, who now works in film. (She doubled for Emma Stone for the aerial dance scenes in La La Land.) “We’ve had two babies. I could have thought: ‘I wish I’d done that before’, but it happened when it happened. I like to say I’m right on schedule.“My approach to music has bled into my acting and it’s nourished it. I’m looser and deeper. I’m liberated in some way. I can be more effective.” That said, there is a fundamental difference. “Acting can grip you with identity issues. What’s this going to lead to? If I fail, what’s that going to mean?” And the music? “I don’t need anything to come from this. I’m happy to have done it and who the heck knows who will buy it? Decca would probably like people to buy it.” The band will tour. There will be shows in London, Paris and Berlin. It means he gets to play.“I’m not an observant Jew,” he says. “But we have a saying: Dayenu, which kind of means if nothing else would happen, I’d be entirely satisfied. What sort of peevish nincompoop would I be if I wasn’t satisfied? It’s an embarrassment of riches.”We fool around at the piano together for a while. We try out Sweet Georgia Brown. He shows me Erroll Garner’s Misty. We talk nerdily about chord voicings and diminished scales. He has a musician’s openness every conversation at a keyboard is an opportunity to learn something new. Finally, we’re told we can get on the Steinway in the lobby, where they’re serving afternoon tea. Together we advance on the young woman hired to entertain the guests with a bit of French classical. She looks up, slightly startled. I say, “This is Jeff Goldblum.” She nods slowly, as if I’ve stated the obvious. She says, “Would you like to play…?” Goldblum fixes her with one of his fabulous grins, eyes wide behind his thick-framed glasses. “Well thank you. I would like that very much.” Would Jeff Goldblum like to play the piano? Well of course he would.Jeff Goldblum and the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra: The Capitol Studios Sessions is released on 9 November.

It is a deal like no other, they have not done it with anyone else. We believe it does not destroy the single market and we need to have that conversation with them.”Overnight, May’s pre-conference announcements were overshadowed by comments by Johnson in an interview with the Sunday Times, in which he cast doubt on the prime minister’s commitment to leaving the EU compared with his own beliefs.“Unlike the prime minister I campaigned for Brexit,” he said. “Unlike the prime minister I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.”On Sunday, May said she was the one ensuring Brexit could be delivered. “I do believe in Brexit, but crucially I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on behalf of the British people, while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of it,” she said.The prime minister also admitted her party could not rule out a hard border in Northern Ireland in the event of no deal, but said there was not an alternative proposal on the table apart from her Chequers plan for a free trade area for goods, governed by a common UK-EU rulebook.“If we get to the point of no deal … we as a United Kingdom government are still committed to doing everything we can to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” she said.“But there is only one plan on the table at the moment that provides for that frictionless trade across the border and indeed between the UK’s other borders with the EU.”Johnson, the most keenly watched challenger to the prime minister, has called for May to ditch her plan and broker a deal similar to the one the EU has with Canada, but which would require customs checks on the Northern Irish border, which he says could be simplified with technology.He said May’s proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was “entirely preposterous” and called the entire plan “deranged”.May said it was wrong for critics of her Brexit plan to portray the alternative as a “free trade deal” and said the other alternative proposed was not a Canada-style deal, which took seven years to negotiate, but a very basic free trade agreement.“People often differentiate Chequers from a free trade deal, but at the heart of Chequers is a free trade deal,” she said.“If you have a free trade agreement, you have to agree the rules you’re going to trade on. Canada for the UK is not on the table from the EU. What is on the table is a basic free trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and single market.”The former Brexit secretary David Davis, who departed the cabinet over the Chequers plan a day before Johnson, said he would vote against the prime minister’s plan as it stood.“It will be a very, very exciting autumn in Westminster because the government, if it sticks with Chequers, will lose the vote,” he told Sky News. “Losing votes is always difficult for governments, but governments have lost votes in the past.”He also cautioned his former cabinet colleague Johnson and said he would back May in any vote of no confidence. “Where I differ from Boris is that he is conflating the two,” he said. “This is such an important issue we must keep it away from internal Tory party battles and from leadership issues.”The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, also made a thinly veiled dig at Johnson in her interview on Sunday morning, especially his admission that he did not fully appreciate the implications of the withdrawal agreement, where leaders agreed to implement a “backstop” to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market to avoid a hard border, should no deal be reached.“I don’t sit around the cabinet table, I’m not in government. I do attend political cabinet. But I knew what was being said in December, I’m not quite sure how the foreign secretary didn’t,” she said.“He hasn’t even mentioned the fact that he was foreign secretary for two years and was in the room helping to influence this and, indeed, was praising it as soon ago as December.”The Labour chair, Ian Lavery, said the interview showed May was “tinkering around the edges” rather than rebuilding Britain. “The Tories are clearly too busy fighting among themselves and have neither the ideas nor the desire to offer real solutions to the problems they have caused,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5258ec46587bf7c236ad5f43c2969e394fb5ea45/0_148_4035_2420/master/4035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ef69239a7d8d30e1a2a4f7b1ea4c615","title":"lewis hamilton wins russian grand prix mercedes team orders sebastian vettel","story":"Lewis Hamilton won the Russian Grand Prix, taking the flag after Mercedes used team orders for him to pass Valtteri Bottas who was second. Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel finished third, which extends Hamilton’s world championship lead over the German to 50 points with five races remaining.Kimi Raikkonen was in fourth. Max Verstappen put in a storming drive from 19th on the grid after penalties for power unit replacements, to carve thorough the field and claim fifth place. His teammate Daniel Ricciardo, who also started at the back, was sixth.Hamilton’s scored a solid victory having briefly lost second to Vettel, he came back with a fine pass. But the crucial moment was when Mercedes ordered Bottas to allow him past to ensure the win. The team have avoided using team orders previously but clearly felt they had to maximise Hamilton’s advantage over Vettel. The team principal, Toto Wolff, was apologetic to a visibly disappointed Finn. “Difficult day for you and for us, let’s discuss it later when we come together,” he said.It is Hamilton’s third win at the Russian Grand Prix and the 70th of his career. He took the flag twice here for Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, both seasons when he went on to win the title. With five wins now from the last six races he is an almost unassailable position to do so again and claim his fifth world championship to equal Juan Manuel Fangio.The victory means Mercedes continue their run of being unbeaten at Sochi since the race joined the calendar in 2014. Hamilton’s eighth win of the season is ominous for Ferrari. Both teams brought aero upgrades to the race, largely centred on the front wing but for the first time this season, Mercedes seem to have gained a real advantage. The Ferrari has struggled, particularly in the technical final sector for grip, where Hamilton has been strong through the last part of the lap all weekend. He exploited it but did not take great pleasure in the manner of his victory.Mercedes had been equivocal about using team orders before the race and Hamilton has been clear in the past he did not want then to be employed. However, having faced such tough competition from Ferrari and Vettel this season and with Bottas clearly out of the title fight, the team opted to ensure Hamilton moved one step closer to closing out the championship. They are in a superb position to do so. On this evidence their car looks exceptionally strong going forward, while Ferrari must find more from their new package.Bottas had got away cleanly from pole but Vettel, from third, made a superb start in the Finn’s slipstream and pulled alongside Hamilton who had started alongside Bottas. But the British driver was just able to hold second through the opening corners.Bottas opened a gap immediately, 1.5 seconds clear of Hamilton with Vettel settling in behind a further two seconds back by lap six. The front runners aiming for a one-stop were, as they had in Singapore, managing their tyres through the first stint.Bottas pitted first and took the soft tyres on lap 13, with Hamilton and Vettel staying out. Ferrari opted to go aggressive and went for the undercut. The German came in a lap later and put in a very quick circuit on his new soft tyres while Hamilton could not match him on track. He came in a lap later to emerge just behind Vettel, losing second place.However, confident with the grip of his new rubber and the pace of his car he charged. Vettel locked up at turn 13 allowing Hamilton to close, enabling him to go for the pass through turn two which Vettel defended. But Hamilton finally made it stick superbly under braking into turn four. Vettel’s defence into two, moving on the straight, was investigated by the stewards but they took no further action.Verstappen, yet to pit, held the lead but Bottas, Hamilton and Vettel once again settled into two-second intervals from one another. By lap 23 Hamilton was catching Bottas and on lap 26 he was ordered to let Hamilton past. The British driver was quicker than Bottas and the team clearly wanted a buffer to the Ferrari. Chief strategist James Vowles told Bottas they were concerned over a risk to Hamilton with a tyre blister and the threat from Vettel. It was a ruthless decision but in no way unexpected.Hamilton was quicker than Verstappen but unable to pass and had to manage the gap until the Dutchman pitted on lap 43. At which point the British driver, with track position, had done enough, back in the lead he was able to control the race and was comfortable to the flag. Vettel tried to push after Bottas but could not threaten the Finn and he remained in third.Sauber’s Charles Leclerc put in another strong performance for seventh, in front of the Haas of Kevin Magnussen. The Force Indias of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez were in ninth and 10th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d57dc8c7b17307cf059a2825a02cfb9ec8664f/0_464_7040_4224/master/7040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44474e02b68e0e9a7b25b0977c065499","title":"cycling mens world road race championships live","story":"42km to go: There’s now a group of nine or so riders getting away, and they’re just two minutes and 40 seconds behind the rump of that lead pack.45km to go: Michal Kwiatkowski is also having issues. Who’s going to be left at the end?!46km to go: Haven’t mentioned the favourite, Alaphilippe, yet. He’s just couched in there, not making any kind of move yet. A bit of a concern here meanwhile about Simon Yates – he’s dropping off and I fear that probably means no way back on a day like this. He’s out of the running.46km to go: The peloton is really starting to string out and split now. Van Avermaet has a few interested parties on his tail here. There’s all sorts going on up there. It’s time to attack!48km to go: Damiano Caruso and Omar Fraile Materanz are up there now in that Van Avermaet break – it’s those three pushing at the moment, chasing hard. They’ll surely be joined soon.49km to go: The Yates brothers are starting to make a bit of a move. Roglic is still with us by the way despite that earlier tumble, still looking strong, competing like the force that he is.50km to go: Looks like four may become three up top. Britton is slowing up, so we seem to have Asgreen, Laengen and Van Rensburg up there now.51km to go: There’s now a four-strong breakaway group from the peloton, Van Avermaet joined by Italian and Spanish riders. We still have those four riders at the top but the gap is narrowing. There are estimated to be about 80 riders left in the peloton.54km to go: Two laps to go now for the peloton and Olympic champion Greg van Avermaet leads a bit of a charge. He’s really laid it down – now the attack is on.56km to go: Ryan Mullen is now done. He spent much of the afternoon in the breakaway group but won’t continue. He can be happy with his afternoon’s work.61km to go: That’s the biggest crash yet, involving four riders – Ben King is among them ... as is Primoz Roglic, the sixth favourite! He’ll get up and on again but has this dealt him a decisive blow?63km to go: Cataldo looks behind him, hoping for a hand, but nobody else wants to push quite as hard as him just yet.65km to go: I think Asgreen, Laengen, Britton and Van Rensburg are those front four. Leading the peloton for a long time there was Britain’s Tao Geoghagan Hart, but now the Italians and Spaniards have taken over – Dario Cataldo making the running here – and attacking at greater speed than we’ve seen so far.68km to go: It’s less than six minutes now, that gap. They’re now down to just four up top and it’s getting harder and harder to keep going.70km to go: The crowd is getting thick enough in some areas to cause some minor road encroachment, although there haven’t been any scrapes yet. Most of all they’re providing a really, really good cycling atmosphere.71km to go: No, Koshevoy now pulls off the lead group and it’s down to six from its initial 11. Asgreen, the Dane, now leads the race.The masses are gathering in the press room as the race moves towards the business end. It’s a multi-national media contingent befitting a world championships – some German spoken here, a bit of Italian there, some French over in the corner. The main topic of conversation is the lack of a press buffet. During the Grand Tours, finish towns at each stage ply media with delectable local delicacies – hoping to earn a mention in the race coverage and boost their tourism credentials. Either the Austrians are so confident with the charm of Innsbruck they don’t feel the same need to provide hospitality, or I have somehow missed a separate buffet room. Either way I don’t expect much sympathy from readers...72km to go: Seven minutes, now, between the two groups. Will anyone else in that front pack start falling away? They’ve really lasted the pace formidably so far, though the faces look etched with pain.74km to go: Fominykh, the Kazakh rider, looks like falling away from the lead group now – which would bring it down to seven. Adam Yates, by the way, remains right at the back of the peloton.75km to go: The peloton now has three laps to go, and they just catch up with Mullen as they cross the line.Paul Griffin is definitely wide awake: “Coincidentally of course, the Britton-Ludvigsson-Asgreen-Fominykh-Laengen-Hnik variation was the controversial, short-lived chess opening concocted in 1973 by the great Grand Master, Jazz saxophonist, and situationist arsonist Van Rensburg Koshevoy, which involved the unexpected deployment of an alto sax filled with paraffin, and a lit bellicoso cigar. Though initially successful, it was quickly proscribed by the International Chess Association causing viewing figures to plummet. Health and Safety gone mad.”I knew all that.77km to go: Bit of a crash in the thick of the peloton there, where it’s really bunched up, and it’s Ruben Guerreiro going over. Fortunately there’s no harm to him and it’s so compacted that he can get back into the thick of it soon enough.78km to go: Van Rensburg still leads overall, by the way. And still looks pretty good ... for now.79km to go: Marcus Burghardt has a problem and seems to be having a bike change. It’s not a quick one – but on he goes and he’ll have some job catching back up with an increasingly speedy peloton.80km to go: Still eight riders in that leading group, and still a good seven minutes ahead of the peloton.81km to go: They’re dropping like flies – Lucas Postlberger and Georg Preidler, the two Austrians, both retire within seconds of each other. The peloton are enjoying a nice, relatively relaxing descent at the moment after all that hard climbing.85km to go: Dumoulin is among those starting to move up near the front of the peloton, Nibali too, and in the next couple of hours these are among the guys you’d expect to start attacking hard.88km to go: Three laps left and the peloton look pained as they ascend. Expect them to start thinning out considerably before long.92km to go: I think Sagan will finish this lap, take the applause, than bow out. No shame for him – what a competitor he is and what a set of achievements in previous years.92km to go: It looks as if we may be seeing the end of Sagan! His glorious reign seems to be over ... he’s dropping well away from the pace now and I wonder whether or not he’ll finish. The peloton is disappearing out of his view.94km to go: Mullen has slowed up and, after a superb few hours’ effort from the Irishman, drops out of the lead group. It’s down to nine now. And, no, it’s down to eight – Dunne also slips away. He’s done brilliantly too.95km to go: Barguil is done, he’s come off. No big surprise after that fall a few minutes ago.95km to go: Connor Swift, the Briton, now takes his turn to lead the peloton. They’re cranking things up. Matej Mohoric is up there too.96km to go: The gap is now down to about nine minutes. The pace is just starting to ratchet up a bit. I think we can say this race is starting ...97km to go: Barguil is still with us, albeit going gingerly and – at the moment – with nobody really around him. Glad he is OK.99km to go: The distance to cover is down to two figures! And the peloton are whittling that gap down closer to 10 minutes. Stannard has dropped back after leading it for some time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1a1e1eb8e2e7f766013f8164ee67ad6acb27cf1/153_0_2558_1534/master/2558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c9a28b1aff5a8a89ca9117825b20a93","title":"f1 russian grand prix live","story":"Hamilton wins after Bottas told to let him go byWell ... thank you for joining. It has been wonderful. It wasn’t the most exciting race overall but some lovely team order and Verstappen subplots to keep us interested.Until we meet again.Here is the race report from Giles Richards:Verstappen: “The goal was always to be fifth but the way we did it, I can be pleased with that.”Bottas got the fastest lap, so he’s had a great day, really...Wolff is on: “We should be over the moon with the one and two but it went against Valtteri, it should have been a win for him.”Hat tip to Verstappen. He made what was pretty run-of-the-mill race into something relatively interesting. Great to go from 19th to first and then fifth.This chat about team decisions. Yes, it is unfortunate for Bottas but this is top level sport, there is no room for sentiment. They have to do everything to win and it includes tactics. He’s going to need more champagne ...Champagne everywhere! What a playful scene. Putin has legged it to save his suit from a drenching, which is upsetting.Deputy prime minster of Russia seems a bit of a token role, I’ll be honest. The drivers are on the podium. Hamilton is on the top step and waiting to spray Putin with champagne. Vlad must not enjoy God Save The Queen. Not his sort of tune.And now Lewis Hamilton is shaking hands with Putin, who is touching the driver on the shoulder. Run Lewis!Bottas: “Personally, everyone saw it, it was quite a difficult race.”Hamilton: “It’s a difficult day as Valterri did a fantastic weekend and he was a gentleman to let me go by.“He did a fantastic job and deserved to win.”Hamilton and Bottas are set for a little chat here. Hamilton is a little subdued as he knows he owes his teammate one.Happy birthday to Max Verstappen. What a race from him. He started in 19th but finished in fifth and even led for the most laps. Incredible.Wolff is already onto Bottas to explain why he made him step aside. It will all be done in private but Wolff seems a little quiet at the moment, possibly worried that it is his house which will be blown down.Lap 5353: Thanks to Bottas being moved aside by team orders, Hamilton has picked up the win. The Briton is now 50 points clear of Vettel in second in the Championship standings! Lap 5253: Not much to see here. Everyone is just going through the motions here. Bottas asks “How are we going to finish the race?” He wanted the win but the team comes first here.Lap 5153: Hamilton is just easing himself round well ahead of Bottas in second. Tactics have won him the race but it has been surprisingly easy for him in the end. Lap 5053: Putin in Sochi there, getting ready to congratulate Hamilton for his victory and explain his admiration for Salisbury. Hamilton is not in any trouble here. Vettel has just lost 1.5 seconds lapping Magnussen and the Ferrari driver is left annoyed that Haas car did not get out of the way quicker.Lap 4953: Not long to go now. Hamilton is getting ever closer to extending his lead in the Championship to 50 points. Vettel, however, looks set to give his all to get beyond Bottas in second. Could be a lively final few laps.Lap 4853: Lerclerc is once again showing what a talented driver he is with a solid race in seventh, which is where he started. What a future he has ahead of him.Lap 4753: There will be no question when it comes to Driver of the Day. Regardless what happens in the closing stages, Verstappen will win that. Although the birthday boy’s new tyre are not helping him chase down Raikkonen.Lap 4653: Everyone will be pleased that this race has not been sullied by rain after a few fears early on that the clouds by gift the track a deluge. Hamilton is looking comfortable at the moment, but who knows what might happen?Lap 4553: Vettel really needs to pull something out of the bag here to keep his Championship hopes alive and he does not have many laps to do it. Lap 4453: Verstappen comes out in fifth now and he is set to chase Raikkonen, which should be fun. Hamilton is now in the lead. Bottas is 1.6 second behind his teammate.Lap 4353: Verstappen tries to get the last bit of momentum out of his tyres before they give up on him. He pits!Lap 4253: Hamilton has had enough of sitting behind Verstappen, as the Dutchman’s tyres are finally coming to an end. He made a failed attempt to go past him, failed and the had a shocking middle section. Hmmmm...he lost a lot of position and time there. Poor from him.Good news! Putin is here and chatting with Bernie. What great banter that must be.Lap 4153: Hamilton is still being slowed a little by Verstappen’s work in front. Can Vettel take advantage of the pace? Lap 4053: A new nose for Ricciardo there. No wonder he’s been relatively slow by his standards here in Sochi. It doesn’t really matter as he’s lost in No Man’s Land in sixth, almost a minute behind Raikkonen in fifth.Lap 3953: Hamilton set the fastest lap of the race but seconds later, Vettel beat his time. Lovely stuff.Lap 3853: Verstappen is looking relatively comfortable at the moment. So much so he’s been told to “keep it up”.Lap 3753: Verstappen has kept his tyres in great condition by managing them superbly since his early aggressive driving. Perez and Ocon have swapped after trying to chase Magnussen. Lap 3653: Red Bull are getting the tyres ready. Both Verstappen and Ricciardo are yet to pit. Verstappen is still quicker than everyone at the moment. Lap 3553: Hamilton is looking comfortable in second (de facto leader) and is extending his leader over Bottas. For time interval fans...Lap 3453: Now or never for Perez to go past Magnussen before he has to allow Ocon back ahead of him.Lap 3353: All pretty quiet, so here’s some earlier drama.Push the button!Lap 3253: Hamilton says he has some “hesitations” when it comes to the engine. His team are looking into it. Will it make a difference? He has spoken of having some blistering on a tyre. He won’t want a defect to slow him down.Vettel has just completed the fastest lap of the race!Lap 3153: Verstappen’s first lap is being replayed, showing how he has the great balance of arrogance and skill when it comes to overtaking. Lap 3053: Bottas is being left behind a little by Hamilton. He must be feeling very frustrated. My 21st birthday is just looking more and more pathetic by each passing lap. I think I went to Bilbao’s stickiest nightclub. Lap 2953: Verstappen is still leading in Sochi, which is a feat in itself. When will he pit? Lap 2853: Bottas asks who made the decision to let Hamilton go past him. He is not happy with the team orders, which is fair enough as he had a good chance of winning.Dan asks: “Surely VET is getting the message that HAM has the upper hand on him this season. Is it all over..?”I hope not as this is going to be very dull raceseason if it is.Lap 2753: Hamilton is pushing his speed a little now he is second as he will want to get a bit of track between him and Vettel.Lap 2653: Vettel is now upping his game to try and challenge Bottas as he really needs to put Hamilton under pressure. Lap 2553: Hamilton has overtaken Bottas to go second! Team orders there in full swing.Gasly explains that his car wasn’t good from the start, claiming a brake failure. Sounds like it Hartley had the same issue. Terrible stuff for Toro Rosso.Lap 2453: Everything is pretty calm at the moment.Fun for ninth placeLap 2353: Bottas is being slowed by Verstappen in front, which might be a little frustrating.Enda asks about the weather. It’s all looking good at the moment, clouds staying away.Lap 2253: Verstappen is still going very well and maintaining his lead at the front. He needs a tyre change at some point. He has a chance of challenging for the podium but he will need to have the race of his life. Lap 2153: Hamilton is opening up a little time gap over Vettel, so he will be feeling relatively relaxed with the situation as they sit in third and fourth.

He tries to bash out, but his ball hits the face and drops back into the trap. This is over, surely a sorry end to a fantastic match. He’s forced to throw a Hail Mary, seeing if he can somehow make it over the water from the bunker. He opens up a 7-iron and ...JT blooters a fantastic drive down the middle of 18. He’s in prime position! Rory takes a 3-wood for safety ... and sends his tee shot into the thick stuff down the right. Chances are, he’ll have to lay up, but we’ll see. This would be a crucial win if JT could convert his advantage into a first point of the afternoon!But what an up and down by McIlroy on 17! He flops out gorgeously to three feet, and tidies up for his par. Thomas sees a putt stop right by the cup for the third hole in a row, and Europe escape with a half! Back on the par-three 11th, DJ pulls his tee shot 70 feet wide of the flag ... then sends a tramliner into the cup! He punches the air and flexes a muscle in celebration! Poulter had sent a nice tee shot to 15 feet, but he can’t make the birdie putt, and all of a sudden he’s had his pocket picked, and he’s one down!The USA can sense something might be happening here. DeChambeau goes two up over Noren through 5. Woods levels his match with Rahm at 12. Watson grabs a hole back against Stenson at 6. Finau punishes Fleetwood for his profligacy at 11 with a birdie to snatch the hole, nipping the comeback in the bud. Reed goes one up over Hatton at 7. And Thomas has drawn a delightful shot into 17, while Rory is through the back and in thick nonsense. A great chance for the USA of going one up with one to play! The American supporters are the ones making themselves heard right now. Le Golf National has fallen pretty quiet in the last half-hour.Thomas watches in horror as his birdie putt on 16 shaves the hole. Not sure how that one stayed out, either! He was raising his putter in Jack Nicklaus style for a nanosecond there. But Rory can’t captalise again. Not sure how these two keep halving holes in par! Mickelson, having raked in a monster to win 6, hands the hole straight back to Molinari at 7 by pushing a short one left. Fleetwood misses a makeable putt of birdie at 11, having nearly pitched straight in with his tee shot. A real chance of rattling Finau passes by. DJ wins the 10th to level up against Poulter again. And Olesen is relentless! He birdies 9 to hit the turn five up on Spieth. Not many folk would have predicted that one.Thomas puts the pressure on McIlroy, sending a heatseeker over the flag at the par-three 16th. That’s given him a 15-footer coming back. But Rory doesn’t flinch, landing his ball 20 feet wide left of the flag, and allowing the slope of the green to take it back a bit. Another putting competition coming up! Not sure this is where Rory is at his strongest, but anything can happen at the Ryder Cup. Meanwhile it’s three birdies in a row for Stenson against Watson he moves three up through 5. And Hatton rolls in a 20-footer on 6 to level his match against Reed.This is fast and furious, and good luck predicting how it’s going to end up! McIlroy and Thomas have reached the exciting closing four-hole stretch, and pepper the 15th flagstick with their approaches. This is a huge moment. Thomas goes first, from eight feet. And he carefully sets his ball on route ... but it defies gravity to brush the right edge of the cup. How on earth did that stay out?! Rory should take advantage, but his five-footer horseshoes out. That is very poor, and Rory looks accordingly frustrated. Poulter hits the flagstick with a chip at 9, but DJ makes a 15-footer to halve the hole. And Fleetwood rattles in a long one on 10 Finau can’t make the 15-footer he’s left with, and his lead is now a mere four holes.Finau is routing Fleetwood, who looks spent after his heroics of Friday and Saturday. A fifth hole in a row, and he’s five up at the turn. Patrick Reed wins 5 to move one up on Tyrrell Hatton. Bryson DeChambeau takes the lead over Alex Noren at 3. Yet another hole for Olesen over a strangely out-of-sorts Spieth he’s four up through 7. Mickelson rakes in a monster left-to-right curler on 6 to stay in touch with Molinari. And Casey takes iron off 13 for safety, yet finds the drink down the left. Koepka takes the lead in that match.Rose and Simpson share the 11th in par. Simpson concedes a three-footer, which was pretty generous considering what’s at stake here. The confidence of a man who’s three up. Speaking of generous, here’s McIlroy handing a hole back to Thomas, tugging a short birdie putt to the left at the par-five 14th. That’s doubly wasteful, because he’d fought hard to get back in position at that hole, Thomas having found the green in two, McIlroy forced to wedge close from deep rough with his third. But they’re all square again. If these matches ended now, Europe would be comfortable winners. But they’re not going to! And most of them are on a knife-edge. So goodness knows how this will end. The Ryder Cup, folks!Koepka wins the 12th, pretty much as expected. These first two to-and-fro matches look like going right to the wire! As does match four, because Tiger makes his eagle at 9, and punches the air in delight. That 3-wood deserved nothing less. He’s just one hole down against Rahm now. Meanwhile another short putt missed by DJ, this time at 7, and the pressure applied by Poulter’s approach tells. Europe are one up in that match again. Another hole for Molinari against Mickelson he’s three up through 5. Stenson makes the first birdie of the penultimate match, at 3. And another hole for Olesen against Spieth, who has bogeyed his last three holes.One of the shots of the week from Tiger! From the centre of the par-five 9th fairway, he flashes a 3-wood right at the flag, taking on the bunker and rough guarding the pin position back right. His ball lands on the small landing surface, and he’ll have a great look at eagle! Meanwhile Rory wins the putting competition on 13 to go in front again in the lead-out match. Or maybe it’s more accurate to say JT loses it: he trundles his birdie effort six feet past, and can’t make the one coming back. Rory couldn’t make his shorter birdie effort, but par suffices.McIlroy and Thomas continue to trade haymakers. What a fight this is! JT’s second to 13 is pin high, 15 feet from the flag. Rory responds by spinning his ball back to ten feet or so. It’ll be a putting competition. Poulter responds to that missed short putt by lashing a 9-iron straight at the flag on 7. Casey’s second at 12 is dreadful, finding thick rough from the centre of the fairway Koepka is 15 feet from the flag in two. It looks like that one will be level again soon enough. And on 8, Finau trundles in a long birdie putt to move four up on Fleetwood.Poulter yanks a putt left of the cup from six feet at 6. Most uncharacteristic behaviour from the living Ryder Cup legend. And that’s the hole to DJ. They’re level again. Meanwhile Tiger knocks in a very missable par putt on the 8th to salvage a half that keeps him in range of Rahm.Thomas’s second into 12 bounces off to the left, and into thick cabbage. He chunks his chip coming up. With Rory close in three, the hole’s surely Europe’s! But JT bumps a sensational chip in from the fringe, one of those that was on an inexorable journey from the second it left the face of his wedge! That’s a quite brilliant effort from Thomas, who is still a Ryder Cup rookie, it’s easy to forget. Rory makes his par to the half, and trudges off in the deflated style. Could that be a huge momentum-shifter in this wonderful match?Finau is firing on all cylinders now!  He arrows his approach at 7 straight at the target, and for a second it looks like he’ll be making eagle from the fairway. But his ball stops just short. He’ll kick that in for birdie, while Fleetwood is in deep filth down the right ... and then hacks out to the left. He nods to Finau and concedes the hole. He’s three adrift now. Better news for Europe at 10, where Casey birdies to grab the lead, while Molinari wins another hole against the seriously flagging Mickelson at 3. And Olesen nearly chips in at 5, but he wins the hole anyway because Spieth bogeys.Elsewhere, Poulter lips out from eight feet at 5 DJ claims the hole. Olesen bests Spieth at 4. Fowler takes a hole back off Sergio at 3. And a wild, wild, wild drive at 7 costs Tiger another hole. It’s all change.And here’s another example of the extreme pressure these players are under. Rose sends his putt off the green at the par-three 8th! He seriously overhits one from 20 feet, and it flies another 20 feet past then down a swale! Simpson makes his birdie anyway, so Rose is spared chipping back up. But the Players champion is in total control of the third game. He’s been sensational this week.Birdie for Casey at 9, and the second match turns all square. Another tiddler missed by Fleetwood, this time on 6, and that record five-point haul looks a pipe dream at the moment. Meantime, a classic matchplay situation develops at the par-three 11th. Thomas lands his tee shot ten feet behind the flag. Rory then plops his 15 feet past ... but the bank takes it back to six feet! Thomas has the chance to turn the screw, but misses his birdie putt. But Rory can’t take advantage! A half in par, after two magnificent tee shots. The pressure of Ryder Cup golf, right there.Rose is always out of position at 7. And with Simpson sending his second over the flag to eight feet, he has to rake in a monster to force his opponent to make his birdie. A gorgeous effort nearly drops, but it stays high on the left and the hole’s conceded. Rahm meanwhile nearly makes a long one on 6, but it’s a couple of blades of grass wide, and he halves the hole with Tiger. It’s a good scrap, this. And speaking of tense tussles, the marvellous opening match is all square now, Thomas having sent his second to 12 feet, the hole his reward.An opportunity for Poulter to win 4, having fired his second straight at the flag. A slightly oscillating uphill 12-footer. It’s never missing. Poulter celebrates as Poulter does.This is a brilliant battle in the leading match, no quarter given. And yet McIlroy and Thomas are able to walk down the fairway together after teeing off at 10, chatting amicably. It’s lovely to see. Brookline seems an awfully long time ago never mind Kiawah Island. Elsewhere, Spieth birdies 3 to level his match against Olesen. And Fleetwood lips out from three feet to hand a hole, and return the lead, to Finau.An out-of-sorts Fowler gifts Sergio the 2nd with a missed tiddler. Back on 1, a similarly struggling Phil Mickelson bogeys, handing Francesco Molinari a fast start. And up on 9, after those loose tee shots, JT is on the green in regulation, Rory in the bunker. But Rory splashes to a couple of feet, while Thomas doesn’t give his 25-foot birdie effort enough juice. A half, and they turn with Europe still holding onto a slim lead.Simpson sends a glorious second into 6 to ten feet. Rose responds by screeching his ball to a halt four feet from the cup. Simpson makes his birdie putt, and that clearly set Rose’s nerves a-jangling like a C86 band, because he nearly yips left. But the ball drops, and Rose stays in touch. He doesn’t look like he trusts his putter today, though trouble could be afoot if he doesn’t calm himself down over those short ones. Meanwhile Rahm is always out of position going down 5. He leaves Tiger with an opportunity to win the hole with birdie from 12 feet, but the putt’s left high on the left, another good chance spurned. Rahm then scrambles his par with a lovely ten-foot slider, and celebrates wildly. A street-fighting Spaniard in the Ryder Cup? Whatever next!Sergio Garcia’s off to a flyer against Rickie Fowler! A wedge pin high to eight feet, the putt carefully coaxed into the cup! Meanwhile on 4, Fleetwood brings his match back to all square by rolling in a 25-footer! Finau will feel a little aggrieved, having nearly holed out from the apron. And on the par-five 9th, JT sprays his tee shot into thick oomska down the right Rory takes an iron for safety and hooks it into even deeper filth down the left! What a business.It’s all happening! McIlroy’s tee shot at the par-three 8th is no good, toppling down the bank to the left. JT responds by fizzing his effort at the flag, 15 feet short. He chips up close, but Thomas makes his putt and celebrates in New Captain America style. A very careless three-putt by Rahm on 4. He looks to have handed the hole to Tiger, but breathes a sigh of relief as Woods pulls a tiddler from short distance. Thorbjorn Olesen birdies 2 to take the lead against Jordan Spieth. And Rose grabs a hole back at 5, a combination of Simpson being out of position from the tee, and his own fine approach to four feet.Fleetwood reaches 3 in two big bangs. And then he nearly guides home a long eagle putt with a huge left-to-right break. One more joule of energy and the hole would have been his. It still could be, because Finau, chipping on in three, leaves his pitch 12 feet short. And the USA’s gentle giant can’t make the birdie putt, so his lead is halved. Meanwhile on 7, Rory reaches the green in two, but a knuckle of rough jutting into his line means he has to take a wedge. He flops gracefully to kick-in distance, and steals a half at a hole the USA were hoping to win, JT having found the putting surface in two without obstruction. And Poulter wins 2 as expected, making a quiet par after DJ’s swim.DJ slam-dunks his tee shot at 2 into the water! That was nowhere near making it! Poulter makes sure he stays dry, sending his tee shot to the back of the green. Up on 4, Simpson is closer to making a 25-footer to steal the hole than Rose is to making his putt. It’s a half, but a chance spurned by Rose, who has looked out of sorts so far.Rahm finds the centre of the par-five 3rd in two. Tiger, having driven wild, can only lay up. He chips to 12 feet. Rahm nearly drains his eagle putt. Tiger needs to make his birdie effort ... and he strokes it in carefully. That’s got the great man out of a hole. Meanwhile Rose needs to wake up, and he finally applies a bit of pressure on his opponent by sending his approach at 4 to ten feet, no small feat given the way the pin’s tucked away back-right.Neither Poulter nor Johnson play good shots into 1. They’re both right at the back of the green, the former just on, the latter just off. Poulter lags up and his par putt is conceded. DJ leaves his putt five feet right. He’s left himself a nervy one, but in it goes. Koepka wedges close at 5 to birdie and win the hole. Rory and JT both spurn makeable chances to win 6.Birdie for Simpson at 3, and Rose is suddenly two-holes adrift. That missed tiddler still playing on the European star’s mind. Finau’s tee shot at 2 is pushed miles right, but he rolls a putt that must be the best part of 100 feet to a couple of turns. It’s enough for another par, and another hole, because Fleetwood can’t get up and down from the bunker at the back. An undistinguished start for one of Europe’s four-point heroes.It’s Ian Poulter and Dustin Johnson! DJ cracks an iron down the track the Postman delivers too! Still nobody’s missed the fairway with their opening tee shot, and half of the matches are now out. On 4, Koepka nearly rolls a 20-footer in for the hole, but it dies left at the very last turn. So unlucky. And up on 5, Rory makes a downhill left-to-right curler to scramble par and save the half! Astonishing! Rory is a notoriously streaky putter Europe will be pleased to see his flat stick appears to be rather warm today.Fleetwood goes the way of Casey at 1. Glug. Finau will win that hole unless he takes driver for his ten-footer. Tiger lags up from distance at 2 to share the spoils with Rahm. And Rory’s in a spot of trouble at 5, shortsided and in thick rough. He whips a chip over the flag to 15 feet, the best he could do, but unless he makes that one, Thomas will have two putts from 30 feet for the hole.Fleetwood sends his second at 1 into Casey’s Bunker. That’s going to be a tricky one, down the glassy green. Especially as Finau has wedged over the flag to 12 feet. On 2, Rahm shows Fleetwood the way to go he’s in the bunker at the back, and flips a delicate shot out, sending his ball dribbling down close to the flag. That’s delightfully judged.Tommy Fleetwood and Tony Finau are out! Both men hit the 1st fairway nobody’s missed yet. McIlroy’s drive at 4 goes into the thick stuff down the left. He does well to power out to the edge of the green. Thomas could only find the edge as well from the centre of the fairway, so he’s let Rory off the hook a little here. Neither player gets particularly close with their chips, then JT misses his eight-foot putt. Rory’s got a chance to win another hole, despite driving into filth! And he takes it! No emotion: he’s promised to keep a lid on it today, after yesterday’s shenanigans. We’ll see how long that lasts! Meanwhile Koepka two-putts for birdie to halve 3 with Casey. Yes he can! Tiger does very well to lag his long putt to kick-in distance, forcing Rahm to make birdie to win the hole. But the big Spaniard is never missing! A deserved reward for that stunning wedge into the green. Rose yips from short distance on 2 to gift a hole to Simpson. And Casey nearly holes a wedge on the par-five 3rd he’ll make birdie, but Koepka’s on the green in two, so you’d expect the US to halve the hole at least.Tiger’s second into 1 is decent, no more. He’s left himself a 40-footer for birdie. Rahm barges through the open door, sending a gap wedge to six feet! That’s a sensational shot. Can he convert?Rory and JT are both greenside at the par-five 3rd in two. The former by the collar, the latter in sand. JT splashes close, maybe six feet, but Rory leaves his effort 12 feet short. However he makes his putt, and seems to have found his equilibrium after that rocky start. But JT has suddenly misplaced his mojo he can’t make his little right-to-left curler, lipping out on the right, and Europe are now leading in the opening match! Back on 1, Simpson and Rose take two careful putts each for a half ... and up on the tee, Tiger Woods and Jon Rahm larrup gorgeous tee shots down the middle.Simpson and Rose crack fine irons down the middle of 1. Rose then finds the centre of the green. Simpson is forced to back off from his approach as the wind changes direction, and a wild cheer goes up elsewhere. Why so much whoopin’ and a-hollerin’? Because Casey trundles in a monster birdie putt on 2! Koepka can’t make a 30-footer, and the second match is all square again! Simpson eventually plays his second at 1, and that finds the middle of the green too. It’ll be a putting competition from 25 feet between him and Rose.Thomas very nearly holes out from the sand at 2, but he’s coming downhill and the ball ends up 12 feet past. Rory can only lag up for par ... but it’s good enough, because his opponent can’t make the one coming back. They’re all square again in the lead-out match. No good news for Europe at the 1st, though Koepka’s in the centre of the green but Casey has flown one in the sand at the back. That’s not the place to be ... a fact illustrated by his splash out, which whistles past the hole, off the green, and into the drink. Up on the tee, Justin Rose and Webb Simpson enter the fray. The FedEx Cup champion versus the Players champ. That should be a great match.Match number two is between Brooks Koepka (boos from the grandstand) and Paul Casey (yays, yippees, etc.) I wonder what’ll be going through Casey’s mind he’s already talked about this possibly being his last-ever Ryder Cup, given his age. Certainly on home soil. He’ll want to go out on a high, if that ends up being the case. Anyway, both chaps send their irons a good way down the fairway. Meanwhile up on 2, Thomas sends a nerve-fuelled iron into a bunker at the back of the par-three. The door’s ajar for Rory, who finds the middle of the green and will have a putt from 20 feet.JT’s putt has a right-to-left curl. It’s not easy, 20 feet away, a little downhill. But he drops it into the middle of the cup, and punches the air in delight! New Captain America is up for this! What a start! And it spooks Rory, who tugs a poor effort wide left. The US have the instant boost they were looking for!Thomas doesn’t fancy toying with the water, so sends his wedge into the heart of the green. Not miles from the flag, mind, 20 feet away. McIlroy decides to go straight at the pin, a shot with a slightly riskier tariff. And fortune favours the brave, as his approach lands ten feet past the pin. Advantage Europe, but both putts are makeable. “Bonjour Scott,” écrit Simon McMahon. “Je pense Docteur le Golf va être très occupé aujourd’hui. C’est vraiment SUR!!! Allez Europe!!!” Bof.And we’re off! JT receives the booing he’d expect, and smiles wanly. Rory is almost deafened by the roar of approval he’s given. And it’s the 2017 PGA champion to tee off, a determined look on his face. He whip-cracks a solid iron straight down the middle. The it’s Rory, who follows his opponent down the track. Rory’s a bit longer, so JT will be wedging in first. A chance to apply some early matchplay pressure ... or maybe he’ll open the door of opportunity for Rory. It’s on!It’s about to happen! The captains Thomas Bjorn and Jim Furyk, gentlemen both, take to the first tee and are greeted with the sort of ovation you’d imagine. Then Rory McIlroy arrives, at which point the Icelandic Thunderclap is performed. Hoo! Huh! What an atmosphere! Rory takes on Justin Thomas, who yesterday completed a reverse takeover of Captain America Industries, out Reed-ing Patrick Reed, taking on the gallery with a comprehensive series of pantomime shushes and ear-cups. Seeing Rory got involved in a spat with the crowd yesterday too, this could be a lot of combustible fun! It’s going to be a lot of combustible fun, isn’t it.Not long now. The atmosphere’s bubbling at the 1st tee, the 94-step-high stand packed full of increasingly intense spectators. It’s a wild scene. Speaking of which, take a look at these characters! Our gallery includes a picture of Morrissey dressed as the Queen. Seemingly he’s recanted on his position regarding her existential status.10-6. It’s the Ryder Cup scoreline that resonates! For example, Europe led 10-6 going into the singles at the K Club in 2006. And they led 10-6 going into the singles at Gleneagles in 2014, too. Europe won both of those Ryder Cups with ease. All hail 10-6!But that’s not what 10-6 is all about, is it. It’s the lead Europe held going into the singles in 1999 at Brookline. It’s the lead the USA held going into the singles in 2012 at Medinah. And we all know what happened back then. It’s golfing shorthand for that strange unease felt going into the final day with a healthy lead, knowing you should seal the deal, but if a few things don’t go your way early doors, if the opposition get on an roll, make a few putts, chip a couple in, quieten the crowd ... if the nerves begin to jangle ... oh me, oh my. Oh help!Put it this way: when Thomas Bjorn was interviewed at the close of play yesterday, he didn’t cite the K Club or Gleneagles. The first things that sprang into his mind were Brookline and Medinah. Oh, and Valderrama, where Europe did their level best to ship a second-day 10½-5½ lead in the singles in 1997, but just about scraped through.So Europe will be nervous, because it’s theirs to lose, and history teaches them the worst can happen from this position. The USA, by comparison, will approach their Sunday tasks with the belief they can nick it and register a victory for the ages they’ve got nothing left to let slip through their fingers. If they don’t manage it, well, the damage had been done already, and that’s another argument entirely. Jordan Spieth certainly sniffs blood, the USA having won the last two Saturday matches, trimming a 10-4 deficit to 10-6, just like the Europeans did at Medinah: “Team golf doesn’t necessarily say who inidually is playing the best golf. But inidual matchplay will. If we get a couple of points early, then the pressure shifts solely onto them. It starts to be a quiet and uneasy feeling around here ... and that will be our goal.” Ulp!Yet look at it this way. Players are going to be nervous at the Ryder Cup whatever it’s not as though the Americans will be totally immune from the odd cold shudder standing on the first tee. Also, there’s a good reason Europe have a four-point lead right now they’ve been the better team this week. The only US stars to truly impress have been Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, Webb Simpson and Brooks Koepka. Europe by contrast have been well served at stages various by Tommy Fleetwood, Francesco Molinari, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Henrik Stenson, Ian Poulter and Tyrrell Hatton. It’s been impressive stuff, especially when you consider the slow start they suffered on Friday. It helps to find the fairway, you see.All of which is a long-winded way of saying: both of these teams will fancy their chances both of these teams are chock-full of champions who can make it happen. Will Europe get the four-and-a-half points they need to reclaim the cup? Or will the USA pull off a New Brookline for a generation that can only remember the Miracle of Medinah?Here we go, then: the 2018 Ryder Cup singles! This promises to be dramatic, exciting, unbearable, exhilarating, intense, weird, fun, life-affirming and more proof, if any were required, that golf is the greatest sport in the world. Whoever you support, may we wish you the best of luck. Golf fever is raging ... because it’s on! C’est en marche! Won’t somebody please call Dr Golf?Finally, some parish notices. This MBM reporter makes no apology for ... outrageous pro-European bias outrageous pro-Sergio bias outrageous pro-American bias through the prism of a self-hating European paying no heed to think-of-the-kids sermonising should Hatton or Reed lose the place completely, and enjoying every second of the brouhaha too childish excitement childish tantrums childish tears. Hey, it’s all part of the fun. Get on board.And here’s your cast-iron, no-quibble, GARANTIE OFFICIELLE !!! There’ll be not a single mention here of Brexit. This solemn pledge also covers other original satirical observations and biting stand-up bits on: golf being a good walk spoiled golf not being a sport because players don’t require the aerobic conditioning of Eliud Kipchoge mashed potato bababooey people in golf clubs wearing clothing from the 1970s people in golf clubs having attitudes from the 1970s Donald Trump. None of that here. Let’s go!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17d0463d51deee5bae391b6672834991d15e910/180_184_3953_2371/master/3953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b255c140156c3b22345fc933d097ecd","title":"hogarths progress review keith allen nick dear rose theatre kingston","story":"Rose theatre, KingstonKeith Allen excels as the embittered old painter in the second of Nick Dear’s two plays following the life of William HogarthThere is a palpable irony to the umbrella title of Nick Dear’s two plays about William Hogarth. The Art of Success, originally staged by the RSC in 1986, offers a rumbustious portrait of the artist as a young man in his creative heyday. The new piece, The Taste of the Town, is a more sombre, reflective work showing Hogarth as an embittered oldster. Even though I preferred the dash and spirit of the first play, the two works offer an intriguing insight into the true nature of Hogarth’s genius.Hogarth was supremely a social painter and London was his canvas. That comes across with abundant clarity in The Art of Success, set in the 1730s. Hogarth, rejoicing in the acclaim for A Harlot’s Progress, is a wildly clubbable figure and, although newly married to Jane Thornhill, an enthusiastic patron of the city’s night workers. But Dear also highlights the paradoxes within Hogarth. Angry at seeing his work pirated, he champions the new copyright laws introduced by Sir Robert Walpole. At the same time, when Hogarth portrays a murderess on the eve of her execution, he finds she is the one who violently protects exploitation of her image.Like one of Hogarth’s own works, the play is really a conversation piece: a picture of the age as well as an inidual. Dear takes us into the brothels, the prisons and the drinking clubs while also reminding us of the punitive power of Walpole who, outraged by Henry Fielding’s stage satires, introduced a form of theatrical censorship that would last until 1968. Anthony Banks’s production offers a vivid panorama of 18th-century London and contains striking performances from Bryan Dick as a defiantly working-class Hogarth, Ruby Bentall as his genteel wife and Jasmine Jones as the aggrieved killer.Everything has changed by the time we get to The Taste of the Town. The time is the 1760s and Hogarth is now living in rural seclusion in Chiswick. He is, however, even angrier than he was as a young man. He is bullying and abusive to his wife, rages against his rival, Joshua Reynolds, and feels insulted by the town’s rejection of his attempt at classical portraiture in Sigismunda. Keith Allen plays him with the right foul-mouthed vigour and it is hard to disagree with the dismissal of him as a bumptious oaf.You feel Dear has fallen out of love with his hero. The real strength of the second play lies in its portrait of the people around Hogarth. Mark Umbers is very funny as the great actor David Garrick, who always steers the conversation round to himself.Ian Hallard, with cupid’s-bow mouth and dandified gestures, gives a lethally precise picture of Horace Walpole, sitting in his gothic construct at Strawberry Hill acting as an arbiter of taste. Sylvestra Le Touzel also makes Lady Thornhill, Hogarth’s mother-in- law, a figure of memorably whaleboned snobbery. Dear’s point is that the aged Hogarth was out of tune with the times and failed to understand that his supreme gift was for satire and sharp-eyed social observation. It’s a perfectly valid argument but it’s more fun watching the young Hogarth tearing through London like a rakehelly Raphael."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5553eed439c06a3bd245cd9f4535641b572b9961/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cf3dc149e03ba284570b7bc168ea620","title":"stephen rea british identity is dwindling brexit samuel beckett cyprus avenue","story":"The actor reveals deep-rooted passions as he talks about his role in Cyprus Avenue, what he learned from Samuel Beckett, Brexit and the TroublesI was reminded of the poem as I read Cyprus Avenue, David Ireland’s controversially violent play about Eric Miller, an ageing Ulster loyalist whose sectarian extremism has shaded into psychosis to the point where he thinks his infant granddaughter is Gerry Adams. In the play Miller recounts a similar, but even more confusing, crisis of identity he experienced on a business trip to London, when he wandered into an Irish bar filled with “English voices, cockney voices, calling themselves Irish”. To his utter surprise, he found himself enjoying the experience and, seduced by the heady atmosphere of inclusion, ended up drinking Guinness and singing Irish rebel songs.“You’ve no idea what that does to a unionist mind like mine,” he tells Bridget, the young female psychiatrist who has the thankless task of probing his tortured psyche. “To be welcomed as Irish by English people calling themselves Irish. To be congratulated for being Irish, when you’ve spent your whole life at war with the Irish. It can be very confusing.” The whole experience was so threatening to his sense of identity, he tells her, that he woke up the following day “full of shame and regret” and never drank again.On stage, Eric’s psychologically revealing monologue is delivered with that air of bewildered stoicism that the actor Stephen Rea has made his own. In the light of all that happens afterwards, it is the pivotal moment in an absurdist drama that is a provocative but illuminating exploration of Ulster loyalist identity in extremis. It turns out that the part was written specifically for Rea by Ireland, a young playwright from the east Belfast loyalist heartlands.“I wrote it long before I knew him, with this platonic ideal of Stephen Rea in my mind,” he tells me. “I felt instinctively that Stephen could inhabit this character and bring him alive in all his confusion and vulnerability. When I first saw him do it, his immersion in the character was so total as to be actually scary.”Such is the disturbing power of Rea’s performance that Cyprus Avenue will undoubtedly be one of the hottest tickets in town when it returns to London’s Royal Court theatre next year following a critically lauded run there back in August 2016. In the interim, it has caused quite a stir in Dublin, Belfast and, most controversially, in New York, where the brutality of Eric’s language and his descent into savage violence ided audiences. There is a viscerally shocking moment early on when he calmly asks Bridget: “Why are you a nigger?” Night after night, without fail, the line drew a collective gasp of outraged disbelief from American audiences.“People were so offended by the play in New York that they stormed out of the theatre,” says Ireland. “There was vitriolic hated towards it on social media and I heard that two guys had a huge argument on the street outside on the opening night.”Over lunch in a Dublin restaurant, Stephen Rea seems blissfully unaware of these extreme reactions. He tells me that the fans who waited around to speak to him after the performances had been effusive in their praise for the play. “They loved it,” he says, “and what’s more they read it as a universal drama about extremism. In the Royal Court, I had the feeling that maybe some middle-class English people were leaving, saying: ‘Oh, that’s the Irish.’ In New York, they were saying: ‘It’s about us.’”He pauses for a moment, his face creased into a familiar frown of concentration. “There is no doubt that it is very much a Troubles drama,” he continues, “but it’s not a balaclava play. It goes to some dark places and takes the audience there, too, whether they want to go or not. It has the most immediate impact of any play I’ve ever been in. Or seen. It’s happening on stage and it’s happening to you.”Much of this is down to Rea himself. He pulls off the almost impossible task of humanising a psychopathic loyalist whose sense of Britishness is so dogmatic yet so fragile. “I do think some people thought he was sympathetic, yes,” he says, “because anyone human is sympathetic and that’s what I look for in a character, that trace of humanity.” So where is the humanity in Eric, who, by the end of the play, despite all that he has done, remains convinced of his own moral rectitude? “Well, he’s lost, absolutely lost. And he’s suffering. He’s in denial about whatever happened to him in the Troubles – the people close to him who have died, the cost of what he has done. But, he’s mad, too – it’s the psychosis of a certain strain of loyalist paramilitarism.”Vicky Featherstone, artistic director at the Royal Court, tells me: “Stephen is playing someone who is the opposite of himself, but he gets inside his skin to the point where, even as you are appalled by Eric, you can almost understand why he got to this point. Physically, psychologically, he goes so deep that you cannot but respond. It is the mark of a truly committed actor who never falters. He works so hard because he believes wholeheartedly in the power of theatre to challenge and transform.”The intensity that Rea brings to bear on the characters he plays is in stark contrast to his relaxed offstage demeanour. Now 71, he looks much younger and has an energy that is palpable when he talks about his work. His unaffected everyman air is such that the other lunchtime diners around us seem oblivious to his presence even though, earlier today, the news broke that his latest film, Black 47, a revenge thriller set during the 1840s famine, smashed all Irish box office records on its opening weekend.I ask him how Dublin audiences reacted to Cyprus Avenue when it played in the Abbey theatre earlier this year, the violence of the Troubles having arguably placed an even bigger psychological distance between the republic and the six counties than the creation of the border in 1921. “That’s an interesting question,” he says. “On one level, their reaction was the same as everywhere else – palpable horror because the audience never think he will go as far as he does. But, it was a different reaction from Belfast, where you didn’t have to explain a single word and they totally got the humour to the point where they were laughing maybe a bit too much.”It seems a volatile subject to explore in Northern Ireland, where the post-Good Friday agreement peace has done little to dent the entrenched sectarianism that still defines its politics. “Well, is volatile a bad word? Personally I would like to have taken it into east and west Belfast, out of theatreland and into those loyalist and republican communities. In a way, that’s where it belongs because that is where it came out of.”Born and raised in Belfast, Rea has made Dublin his home. Like Paulin, he is that rare thing: an Ulster Protestant with progressive socialist ideals that include a belief in a united Ireland, which the post-Brexit possibility of a hard border has only strengthened. He has just appeared in Hard Border, a short film commissioned by the Financial Times and written by Clare Dwyer Hogg, a poetic meditation on belonging and identity that is also blistering in its castigation of Tory Brexiters such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. “I’ll probably get flak for this, but it seems to me that, no matter how much they enforce Brexit, the British identity is dwindling,” he says. “It’s really the idea of English identity that needs to be addressed now. That English colonial racism is still there. Look how Englishness presents itself at the World Cup. They are always convinced that they are going to win and immediately start singing Rule Britannia. It’s crazy. The colonial racism is still there. It’s embedded.”In person, Rea is engaging and easygoing company, but one can sense his deep passion for radical politics and theatre. In 2020, on the 40th anniversary of Field Day, the theatre and publishing company he established with fellow Northern Irish writers Brian Friel, Seamus Heaney, Tom Paulin and Seamus Deane, he plans to host “a different kind of literary festival” in Derry.“It will be people from troubled areas – Palestinian activists, black American activists, Egyptian activists,” he says. “We need to look at these other struggles in terms of what is happening here, where everything here seems to be going backwards. I don’t think it is the time to do a dignified play like Friel’s Translations. We need to hear voices speaking directly of their experience. And we will learn from that, north and south.” He grows visibly emotional. “I have one girl I know who will read at the event. She’s a poet and an asylum-seeker. I want to highlight the disgusting way we treat asylum-seekers here. We are locking up poets. It makes me sick. We are the land of poets, we produce posters of our writers and poets for tourists, but we’re locking up poets because they are the wrong colour.”There is definitely something of the old, unreconstructed socialist about Rea. As Featherstone puts it: “Stephen is a socialist insofar as he has a truly democratic mind that questions the way we put on plays, discuss them and teach them. He has a genuine belief in working-class education and empowerment because he is a product of that himself. His generosity towards younger actors and his enthusiasm for new writing is extraordinary.”For all that, there is guardedness about Rea, and one senses at times that he is keeping his real thoughts in check. This reticence may be “the tight gag of place” that Seamus Heaney identified as a trademark of Northern Irishness, but more likely it is a form of self-protection against interviewers who broach the singular circumstance of his personal life. In 1983, Rea married Dolours Price, an IRA volunteer who had not long been released from prison having served seven years for her part in the bombing of the Old Bailey in March 1973. They were together for 20 years until their orce in 2003. They had two sons, who are now in their early 20s, and of whom Rea is fiercely protective.Price died in 2013, but not before she had granted an interview with political journalist Ed Moloney, with the proviso that it be broadcast after her death. A newly released documentary, I Dolours, is constructed around it. It shows how Price’s fierce commitment to the republican cause, which is only occasionally tinged with regret, is given context by her family history – both her mother and grandmother were imprisoned by the British. In jail, she was force-fed daily for months while on hunger strike, before being released on humanitarian grounds when the anorexia her treatment caused was deemed to be life-threatening. By turns mesmerising and chilling, particularly when she relates her role as a driver in the “disappearances” of suspected informers, her testimony provides latter-day evidence of WB Yeats’s dictum that “too long a sacrifice makes a stone of the heart”.In any interview with Stephen Rea, one is warned that the subject of his ex-wife is out of bounds on account of his responsibility to his sons, so we talk around it. He says, at one point: “At a certain critical point in my career, it all got very difficult.” I ask if his marriage affected his professional life in terms of the roles he was – or was not – offered. “Probably. Probably. But it was more that it produced in me a silence. Back then, I had some very aggressive interviews, mostly with English journalists but also from some Irish ones. I just decided for a time not to do any interviews.” He trails off and looks pained. “I’m uncomfortable with all this. I don’t like assumptions of what my politics are because they may change. Identity changes. It can change with a poem you might read or a song you might listen to. People will say, ‘Oh, that’s bullshit’, but it really isn’t.”I put it to him that his journey since has, to say the least, been a singular one for someone from his background. “Well, I’m happy with that. Unionists were, and still are, cut off not just from Catholics and from Ireland, but from the world. It’s pure isolation. And it is so drummed into the young that they cannot let go of these views.” Has it been a hard road to travel, though, given his roots? “No, it’s been a great road. A great road. I refuse to see people in a sectarian way. Always have. It would be an insult to myself to have to think that way. I just don’t see people in those terms.”As a teenager in the 1960s, Rea attended Queen’s University in Belfast. “I was a lousy student but I had great fun there,” he says. “It was absolutely transformative for people like me, whose parents had left school at 14, to be given a grant to pursue further education.” Among his contemporaries were several of the young leftwing activists of the nascent civil rights movement, including Eamonn McCann, Michael Farrell and Bernadette Devlin. “It was very exciting. You’d hear those young people speaking and you could sense how bright they were and how angry.”After a stint at the Abbey Theatre School in Dublin, he moved to London for a time, joining Freehold, an experimental theatre group. “We staged a very political version of Antigone. It was a time of squats, dole money and radical beliefs, which was great for creative freedom. I remember we all went together to the big anti-Vietnam war rally in Grosvenor Square in 1968.”On a visit home to Belfast in August 1969, he witnessed the cataclysmic outbreak of sectarian violence that marked the end of the short-lived civil rights era.“I was fired on by loyalists on the Falls Road,” he tells me. “There was a gathering and, after police had fired CS gas at the crowd, out of the fog came a bunch of loyalists on a truck firing into the area.” He shakes his head. “It all went off that night. People burned out of their houses, people fleeing over the border as refugees. It was mad – let’s shoot some Catholics and show them their place.”Throughout the 70s, Rea worked regularly in theatre and appeared fitfully in films and television dramas, landing a substantial role as an exiled Czech dissident in Professional Foul, a 1977 BBC play by Tom Stoppard. In 1982, the Irish director Neil Jordan cast him as the lead in Angel, a film set in Northern Ireland in which Rea played Danny, a saxophonist in an Irish showband, who witnesses the murder of his manager by a paramilitary gang. In 1992, Jordan gave him the lead in The Crying Game, a prescient film about gender, race and belonging set against the backdrop of the Troubles. “It was a huge thing for me,” he says. “I had no sense of how groundbreaking it would be when we were making it, but I think Neil had. It played with identity in such a forward-thinking way as a flexible, fluid, elastic thing. And, it had an enormous effect. I was even a gay icon for about three weeks in New York.”With hindsight, what does he consider his most important roles? He gives the question considerable thought, staring off out the window. “Well on stage, I played Playboy of the Western World at the English and the Irish national theatres. That was immense. Then, there was Brian Friel’s Freedom of the City at the Royal Court, which was the first time I met Friel. It was a play about Bloody Sunday in Derry just months after it happened. And Translations, of course, another Friel masterpiece. I remember getting the script and putting it down at the end of the first act, thinking ‘this is a masterpiece’. It remains a magnificent play, a masterful exploration of identity, which is our concern on this island, of course, our obsession.”At the Royal Court in 1976, he worked with Samuel Beckett on Endgame, a daunting experience made all the more so by the fact that he was taking over the role of Clov after Jack MacGowran, the playwright’s favourite actor, died. Did he converse with Beckett? “Well, I listened.” Did they socialise? “Oh yes. He was a great man for having a drink, but I was young and nervous of him in a way, even though he was a perfect gentleman.”The experience transformed him as an actor. “Beckett gave me two groundbreaking notes. I asked him what a line meant and he said: ‘Don’t think about meaning, think about rhythm.’ It’s genius, really, because language is rhythm. There was another line in which Clov says: ‘I’ll leave you.’ I wanted to know if he was going to the kitchen or going for good? Beckett replied: ‘It is always ambiguous.’ For me, that is foundational to how I have approached acting. All of this other stuff that people go on about – ‘What’s my intention? What’s my motivation?’ – well, maybe you don’t know. Maybe, it’s ambiguous.”That talent for ambiguity has stood Rea in good stead, whether as Francie Brady’s da in Jordan’s The Butcher Boy or the mysterious Gateshead in the labyrinthine television miniseries, The Shadow Line, for which he received a Bafta for best supporting actor in 2012 or, more recently, as the scheming Prince Vassily Kuragin in the BBC’s 2016 adaptation of War and Peace. Along the way, he also worked, and became friends with, another master of ambiguity, the late Sam Shepard, about whom he wrote a heartfelt appreciation for this newspaper following the latter’s death last year.“He was another Sam who was out on his own, really,” he says. “Old-fashioned in a way and enigmatic. He was quintessentially American but, as a dramatist, essentially European. He loved Brecht and Beckett.” Was it a shared passion for theatre that brought them together? “Maybe. Maybe. I don’t really know why we became close friends, to be honest, but we did. And we stayed close even though he was very separate. He’s a Scorpio. Keeps things close to his chest. Maybe a bit troubled.” I am about to say, “Just like you”, but hold my tongue. It’s implied. It’s understood. It’s a quintessentially Stephen Rea moment.Cyprus Avenue runs at the Royal Court, London SW1 from 14 Feb-16 Mar 2019. Tickets go on sale on Friday 5 October royalcourttheatre.

On my first cycling day, winds are blustering around 30-40mph, but my cycling guide and driver Mark Cox, with 30 years of cycling, sea kayaking and mountaineering guiding experience, has no qualms. Mark the “wind whisperer” can adjust the route to make sure cyclists are not riding into strong headwinds, he explains, which is why this trip is about half the official route. They have cherry-picked sections, avoiding busy roads and adding in a rest day to explore.North Coast 500 was launched in 2015 as an initiative to help the local economy and such is the marketing potential of this route, it is co-sponsored by Aston Martin. The switchback single track road from Achiltibuie to Drumbeg in Assynt is a great equaliser: no one can go faster than 25mph, so there is delightful synergy between car, camper van and cyclist, as we all want to give way to the other to stop and enjoy the white beaches, soaring peregrine falcons, cormorants, sea eagles and e-bombing gannets.While eyeing up the 20-plus range of freshly baked pies at the Lochinver Larder (yes please to fresh poached salmon in a creamy seafood sauce with dill and potato), I meet four lean Lycra-clad cyclists from the army on a “fun” cycling and camping training trip. They made me realise how Wilderness Scotland makes the NC500 very achievable: they book all the meals and accommodation, due to the overwhelming popularity of the route and relative scarcity of restaurants and hotels. They also provide bikes, which are valeted every night by the guides, and picnic refreshments en route, such as cafetière coffee (specially blended by the Inverness Coffee Roasting Company).On my last day, as we head east along the top of Scotland, I get my first glimpse of Orkney, then cycle past old flagstone-cutting mills – a reminder of a 200-year-old worldwide industry exporting Caithness flagstones. Suddenly my thoughts of kitchen-floor upgrades are supplanted by the sight of the bright red, green and blue houses of John O’Groats, which lies on the UK’s most northeastern tip. When I arrive at the iconic white signpost, there is an informal queue of cyclists lining up for photos. I feel an incredible sense of adventure and achievement at having cycled through such dramatic and varied landscape and also a sadness that the journey is over. Mark comments: “It’s the camaraderie and the craic of the group which makes the week. It’s handshakes at the beginning and hugs at the end.”So when is the best time to go? Pretty much anytime, thanks to the wind: the feared west coast midges, whose biting clouds can ruin a day, won’t come out if there is a whiff of a breeze above 6mph – one thing you can rely on.The North Coast 500 cycling trip begins in 2019. The six-night tour includes bed and breakfast accommodation, lunch, some evening meals, a guide and support rider. Bikes are available for hire. From £1,695 (wildernessscotland)There is something tremendously satisfying about pedalling from one side of an island to the other, so it’s no wonder the English coast-to-coast is top of so many cycling bucket lists. The problem with the “official” C2C route – and also its selling point – is that it’s thigh-tremblingly hilly. Happily, there is an alternative for those who want to traverse the north in a challenging but rather less masochistic manner: Hadrian’s Cycleway.Named after the Roman wall guy, the 174-mile Sustrans route starts in Ravenglass in southwest Cumbria. Pleasingly signposted with a centurion’s helmet and the number 72, it hugs the coast to the Solway Firth and heads east to South Shields, very loosely following the route of Hadrian’s brickwork.Since I’m allergic to panniers, I went with CycleActive, who organise self-guided trips with luggage transfers and accommodation. They bin the first 23 miles and start at Whitehaven on the grounds that a) Hadrian probably went nowhere near Ravenglass, b) Whitehaven is easier to get to, and c) 151 miles with 7,171ft climbing is quite enough, thank you very much. Like most right-thinking people, they go west-to-east because there’s more chance of a tail wind. Their version ends in Tynemouth because what better way to toast the achievement than fish and chips in a proper seaside resort?The trip takes three days, perfect for the two-wheeled dilettante. Day one is flat – it was a good few hours before I’d burned off the deservedly award-winning breakfast from Brookfield Guest House in Penrith, from where we had been bussed to the start. I borrowed one of CycleActive’s bikes, a Trek hybrid with mountain bike suspension and knobbly tyres: a bit of a tank for getting up hills, despite low gearing, but perfect for the many miles of gravel and muddy cycle paths the route encompasses.Until this trip, I’d never been north of Maryport. Now I could work for the Solway Estuary tourist board. The red sandstone beaches! The double-fronted Georgian houses! The view of the Galloway hills over to Scotland!Night two was in Carlisle, memorable only for the dreamy slow-cooked beef shin I had at Foxborough, a friendly restaurant. By that point I’d still not seen any of Hadrian’s wall, despite 61 miles in my legs. He’d turn in his mausoleum if he knew that the start of his legendary fortification, in lovely Bowness-on-Solway, is now marked with a dog poo bag dispenser bigger than the sign.It took another 20-odd miles before I saw any of Hadrian’s handiwork, near Birdoswald Roman Fort, on day two, the hilliest third of the trip. I paid £8.30 to visit the fort: an expensive crash course in Roman history. Carry on instead to Vindolanda, an archaeological treasure trove which was a key military post built on the northern frontier of Britain several decades before Hadrian got into wall-building.Roman ruins are not usually my thing but I loved the snazzy sandals the archaeologists have dug up, and the wonderfully banal letters written on wooden tablets, especially a Roman woman begging her pal to come to her birthday party. Pro tip: if you’re planning some sightseeing, don’t wear slippy cycling shoes you can’t walk in. I’ll be billing the Romans for some new cleats.I began day three refreshed after a night in the beautiful Carraw Guesthouse, which is built right on the wall, a few miles off-route but well worth the detour. It was a long day in the saddle with some weaving in and out of industrial estates – but overall an adventure of Roman proportions.The three-day, three-night tour costs £325 including accommodation and luggage transfer. Bike hire is £90 or £135 for an electric bike (cycleactive)The long, rocky driveway to beautiful Blackwood Forest in Hampshire was the perfect preparation for some healthy relaxation during our cycling holiday, forcing us to slow down. When we were finally in the 270-hectare wood and at our cabin, we could feel this was going to be our little oasis, the still immensity of its dense beech tree canopy muting the nearby M3 to a distant murmur.Forest Holidays is a back-to-nature set-up with cabins sparsely dotted among the woods and there are three walking and bike trails (the longest is 6km) within the grounds. “Did somebody say ‘hot tub’?” became our four-year-old’s catchphrase during our stay – her cheeky attempt to get us back from the cycling and into the tub on the patio whenever possible. We also had a log burner and a gas barbecue, too.We were a little wary about how much cycling our 10-year-old daughter would be able to manage given that she mostly just pootles around a local park and hasn’t been on the road yet, but apart from a few slightly steep sections where she got off and pushed, she was fine. None of us is exactly king or queen of the mountains so we were very happy indeed with the gently undulating trails and the top-notch mountain bikes we hired. I strapped our four-year-old daughter into a little single trailer attached to my bike and she happily bumped along admiring the scenery – though she occasionally insisted on getting out and running alongside us while we cycled. (I didn’t think we were going that slowly – you could say she’s quite energetic.)The tracks are very safe and you only come across a few cars (and other cyclists for that matter) on the gravel roads in the forest and they’re going so slowly that it’s not a worry. There are plenty of other nearby trails outside of the forest if you’re more adventurous or your children are used to the roads.Stopping to see some horses in a nearby paddock, all was calm and quiet until our elder daughter breathlessly informed us of a snake she’d seen slither back into the undergrowth. Hmm, perhaps it was a slow-worm? “No, Dad, it was a snake!” It was probably not the best time for me to remind them of The Gruffalo (“A snake saw the mouse, and the mouse looked good”) and I could see our youngest getting agitated so we swiftly took off again.Alison, our brilliant and sprightly Forest Ranger, took us out early that evening on a short tour and engaged us all in the history of the forest and its flora and fauna – explaining why yew trees are often found in churchyards, the difference between the meadow and forest plants, the different types of deer, the purple emperor butterflies she’s seen here – and confirmed that, yes, it was almost certainly a slow-worm my daughter had seen.On Sunday, after making the short drive to Winchester for lunch and a wander around the beautiful cathedral grounds, we headed home for another cycle around the forest and back to our hot tub for one last well-earned soak.A three-night break in a Golden Oak three-bed cabin at Blackwood Forest costs £695. Bike hire from £18 (forestholidaysblackwood-forest)Whizz around a velodrome, bounce down a mountain trail or follow a sedate path by the sea…1. The velodrome experience It’s unlikely you’ll break a cycling speed record on your commute, but you might at a velodrome. The indoor track at the Lee Valley VeloPark, dubbed the Pringle because its curving roof resembles a crisp, is where Sir Chris Hoy and Dame Sarah Storey won London Olympic golds. It’s also the fastest in the world. All abilities are catered for, including kids hour-long taster sessions cost £45. You can also experience perilous speed at Manchester’s National Cycling Centre, the busiest velodrome in the world. Taster sessions cost £10.50 (visitleevalley.org.uk nationalcyclingcentre).2. The car-free experience What better place to cycle than one of the few places in the world that is joyfully car-free? Get a ferry from Guernsey to Sark, the least spoilt of the Channel Islands. Locals (all 600 of them) get around on foot, by bike or on horse-drawn carts. Bike hire is available all year, and trails will take you pretty much the whole way around the island, through plush forests, to broad sandy beaches. However, cycling the cliff-top paths is forbidden, a local advises – it’s walking only – and cycling after dark is best avoided as there is no street lighting. The upside is that Sark is a “dark sky island”, so it’s ideal for star gazing – you can cycle by day and enjoy the spectacular sight of the Milky Way by night (Bikes can be hired from atobcycles or avenuecyclessark).3. The downhill experience If it’s adrenaline and nature you’re after, head to Coed y Brenin (“the forest of the king”), a mountain bike mecca in Snowdonia National Park. You can choose from eight trails – one, for beginners, takes in the magnificent waterfalls on the Gain and Mawddach rivers and is based on open forest roads. The centre’s most challenging trail is suitably titled the Beast of Brenin, physically and emotionally challenging but with spectacular views of Snowdonia (beicsbrenintrails).4. The trans-UK experience If you fancy the long-haul challenge rather than a one-day affair, try EuroVelo – a network of 15 long-distance cycling routes that criss-cross Europe. The destinations sound romantic and ambitious – Ireland to Russia (EuroVelo2) or the North Sea Route (EuroVelo12) that begins in Bergen, Norway, passes through Denmark, Holland and Germany, and ends in the Orkney Islands – complete the journey and you’ll have clocked up 5,900km. For a gentler option you could stick to the British one, taking you from east Anglia up to Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness, before you have to navigate the North Sea ferry system. “Sample wee drams in Scotland,” the EuroVelo website advises. You’ll need to sample a lot more than that (eurovelo).5. The family-friendly experience The Camel Trail is popular with families for good reason – you can cycle for 17 miles one way under the cover of a canopy of trees for part of it following an old railway line along the north Cornwall estuary, then along the River Camel and the sandy shores of the Camel Estuary. The flat terrain makes it perfect for young children and there’s a range of bikes available: “tagalongs” for children who’ve just started cycling, trailers for toddlers and tandems for adults and teens, from £28. The reward? Reaching the picturesque harbour town of Padstow with its cobbled streets, cosy pubs and cafés: homemade Cornish ice cream for the kids, Rick Stein’s fish and chips and a pint of Tribute from the St Austell Brewery for deserving grown-ups (cameltrailcyclehire)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6037eeaaf178c8594e47fa3092d46c52d51fbb63/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8f1fd266530a3b9ef14a088dc9c1082","title":"tom daley talks fatherhood on lauren laverne first desert island discs","story":"Diver tells host becoming a father has given him a new emotional distance from sportTom Daley interview: ‘If I hadn’t met Lance, I don’t know if I’d be ing now’Tom Daley, the first Desert Island Discs castaway to be interviewed by Lauren Laverne, reveals fatherhood has given him a new emotional distance from the competitive world of sport.The er and his husband, the film-maker Dustin Lance Black, announced the birth of Robert Ray in June.“There are bigger things than Olympic medals,” Daley tells Laverne. “My Olympic medal is Robbie.”Speaking on BBC Radio 4, the British champion, 24, describes fatherhood as offering an “amazing, magical experience every day”.Choosing tracks including Elvis Presley’s Suspicious Minds and Ellie Goulding’s How Long will I Love You? for his stay on the island, Daley added that he believes he now trains with more focus at the ing pool.“I feel incredibly lucky to wake up and see our little Robbie Ray in his little bed. He is just the cutest little thing. So I want to make sure that every little second I am away from him in training, I am doing the best that I can do, to make sure it is damn worth it,” he says.And Daley pushes his luck with Laverne when it came to the luxury item the programme’s venerable format allows him to request. As a keen cook who, he said, hosts a Monday night dinner club for between 12 and 16 guests at his home every week, Daley asks for an entire fitted kitchen.But Laverne puts her foot down. “I am new to this. It is my first day,” she says. “I have really got to stick to the rules and I think a full kitchen is a stretch. I can do you an oven.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380afbd4589f3a54df76a330b698ec98aeb99084/0_197_6628_3979/master/6628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1038593cfaa890f138b738fda9435d1e","title":"brazil sees black female candidates surge after of rising star","story":"The last time Renata Souza saw her friend and colleague Marielle Franco, they hugged and kissed and said they’d see each other the following morning.They were scheduled to meet with higher-ups from their political party to finalize Franco as a vice-gubernatorial candidate for the state of Rio de Janeiro.But minutes after they parted, a reporter called Souza to tell her that Franco had been murdered.A breakout star on Rio’s political scene, Franco was a black woman from one of the city’s poorest favelas who defied the odds to become the fifth most voted-for councilor in 2016.She was an outspoken critic of Rio’s heavy-handed police and had recently become the chair of the committee overseeing the city’s federally mandated military intervention.Franco and her driver Anderson Gomes died instantly when two men opened fire on their car on 14 March in what police believe was a targeted assassination.No arrests have been made, but as Brazil prepares for legislative elections, Franco’s legacy can be seen across the country: an unprecedented number of black women have registered to run for office – and many invoke her example on the campaign trail.As well as choosing a new president next Sunday, 7 October, Brazilians will also elect 513 congresspeople, 54 senators and more than 1,000 state legislators.Although she was a local politician, Franco’s murder fuelled an urgent conversation about racial and gender representation among Brazil’s elected officials.Souza is now running for a seat as a state legislator. “I always thought about being on the frontline myself, but Marielle’s murder brought a sense of urgency. I hesitated for months, but knew I had to run,” she said.“Now I feel her every single moment – in every flyer I hand out, every speech I give, every conversation, every joke.”Souza and Franco met as teenagers in a college prep course in Maré, the Rio favela where they both grew up. They both won scholarships to one of Rio’s best private universities and went on to pursue graduate degrees. They became outspoken human rights activists and became involved with a newly founded leftwing party, the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL). After Franco was elected in 2016, Souza became her chief of staff.“I feel a responsibility to continue what we’d been building for the 18 years we were activists together,” Souza explained. If elected, she will focus on legislation related to reducing the number of homicides of poor, black residents in Rio’s periphery.The first bill she hopes to pass would ban police operations during the hours when children are going and coming from school.Ahead of next month’s election, a group of women launched Black Women Decide, a collective aiming to raise black female candidates’ profiles and present data about the challenges confronting black women in politics.Juliana Marques, a member of the collective, says the dynamics of funding create a vicious cycle, as parties tend to invest most money in incumbent candidates.“The rules of the game are rigged. But we’re the largest portion of the population – for the sake of democracy, we should have lawmakers that are at least somewhat similar to the demographic makeup of the population.”“Marielle was our voice. It was such a blow to lose her, but I never expected in my lifetime to see so many black women running,” said Martilde Guilhermina, 59, at a rally in Rio, where Souza and other black female candidates were speaking. “Politics is a space where we black women have always been denied access.”Igor Soares, a high school teacher, said: “You don’t need to look far in Brazil to see how erse it is … I’d like to see politics reflect that more, in order to make Brazil less racist and less machista.”After a recent rally in Rio, Dani Monteiro, a 27-year-old from a Rio favela also running for a seat in the state legislature, said: “Most of the representatives in the state legislature are white men. They can’t even imagine living the reality we live – they don’t live with constant shootings, having to protect your kids from stray bullets.“We don’t yet know the scale of what we’re doing: we’re in the eye of the storm now — but I really think we’re a part of a historic moment in Brazil,” Monteiro said.Franco’s legacy has reached far beyond Rio: hundreds of kilometers north in the Amazon region, Vivi Reis, who is running to be a deputy in the lower house, also cites Franco as a political inspiration.“Her murder was a way of trying to shut us up, in the most brutal way, but it’s done the opposite of that. Now we’re screaming louder.”"},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsToday\u0026rsquos graduates want more from work than just the pay chequeStudents are well-positioned as the growing economy increases employment demand for graduatesHow can graduates make sure they\u0026rsquore appreciated and what do their bosses expect in return?Personal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryHow graduates can make sure they are skilled-up and job-readyEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersWhat is likely to pay off the most \u0026ndash investing in furthering your education or starting your career instead?Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsInternships can be an effective way to gain work experience and increase your employability \u0026ndash but is there a downside?Jobseekers can take steps to maximise their chances of getting hiredHow employers use interviews to gain an understanding of what makes people tickAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interview"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3646231.1538217314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit no deal could halt production at uk toyota plants","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Burnaston plant in south Derbyshire is one of nine the Japanese car giant has in the UK. Photograph: Matt CardyGetty ImagesToyota has said that production at its UK factories would be disrupted for weeks or maybe months if Theresa May failed to strike a Brexit deal.The Japanese car manufacturer is the latest in a list of foreign car companies to say there could be temporary stoppages and maybe even job losses if there are checks at Dover and Calais as a result of no deal.“My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,” Marvin Cooke, the managing director at the firm’s plant in Burnaston, near Derby, told the BBC.Asked how long the production stoppages would last, he said: “We can’t predict – it could be hours, days, weeks – even months.”His warning follows statements by Jaguar Land Rover and BMW over the consequences of no deal for the British car manufacturing business, which employs more than 186,000 people directly and more than 856,000 indirectly.Greg Clark, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the Chequers Brexit proposal was “a very practical set of proposals precisely calibrated to avoid those checks”.He said he disagreed with the assessment that the EU had rejected Chequers and said there would be a heavy toll to pay across the EU with car manufacturers if a deal was not struck.But he admitted that Britain would lose its potential as one of the world’s leaders in car innovation if there was no deal. “To see that slip through our fingers is something that we would regret for ever,” he said.The Burnaston plant in south Derbyshire is one of nine the Japanese car giant has in the UK and is the home of the Toyota Auris and the Avensis. Toyota has plans to take on 400 new staff as part of a £250 million investment in a new production line for an updated Corolla.It produces cars worth £12 million a day with components arriving every 37 minutes as part of the “just-in-time” production process, which means car manufacturers do not store parts in on-site warehouses.Instead its factories rely on smooth delivery of parts from within the UK and especially Europe, from where 1,000 lorries a day cross the channel with parts for car manufacturers in Oxford, the Midlands, the north and the north-east.Mr Cooke said Toyota was looking at its options for storage but said checks and delays would add costs to the bottom line permanently.“It would reduce our competitiveness. Sadly, that would reduce the number of cars made in the UK and that would cost jobs.”Last week Honda said it would look to stockpile some components as a contingency. Earlier this month JLR announced that 2,000 staff would move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant just hours after it was accused of “scaremongering” by a hard Brexiter MP.BMW announced it was planning to shut its Oxfordshire plant for a month to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts. –  Service"},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

Extra officers are likely to be drafted in to meet the deadline.They could just about drop everything else they\u0027re doing, every other background check for generals to get the next star, and cabinet secretaries and US attorneys, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. If they want to put 500 agents on this tomorrow they could do that.One of their first tasks will be speaking to possible corroborating witnesses. Mark Judge, Mr Kavanaugh’s friend, was said by Prof Ford to be in the room when the then 17-year-old Mr Kavanaugh allegedly hustled her into a bedroom, closed the door, pinned her to the bed and attempted to rip off her clothes.Christine Blasey Ford, preparing to testify before the Senate judiciary committee on ThursMr Judge, who has been hiding out at a beach house in Delaware for the past week, declined to speak at Thursday’s Senate hearing, but has said he is willing to speak to the FBI.He denies all knowledge of the attack recalled by Prof Ford, saying her accusations are “bizarre” and politically-motivated, adding: “It’s no situation I recall ever being in.”Prof Ford told the committee that she crossed paths with Mr Judge at a Safeway supermarket a few weeks after the attack, and that he looked ashen upon seeing her. The FBI could ask Safeway for their employment records, in an attempt to narrow down the time frame of the attack, Prof Ford being unable to recall the exact date that summer.Investigators are also likely to speak in the coming days to Leland Keyser and P.J. Smyth, high school friends who Prof Ford said were at the party. Both have said they do not remember being at any such party, but are willing to cooperate.The FBI cannot compel anyone to speak to them, or obtain search warrants, unlike in a criminal investigation.Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, voted with a caveat Another team will likely try to determine the house at which the party took place, scouring housing records to find where friends of Prof Ford and Mr Kavanaugh lived at the time, and searching for a property that fits her description of having a bathroom upstairs, with a narrow staircase and a bedroom opposite the bathroom.And Prof Ford’s account is not the only one being investigated by the FBI, a source close to the inquiry told the New York Times.Deborah Ramirez, in an interview with The New Yorker, alleged that Mr Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a night of drinking when they were both students at Yale. Agents are now expected to seek interviews with his university friends, roommates and fraternity brothers about his drinking habits at Yale, and his behaviour at parties in Lawrance Hall, where he lived that year and where Ms Ramirez claimed the episode occurred.Another woman, Julie Swetnick, on Wednesday became the third woman to accuse Mr Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, although it was not clear whether her claims were also being investigated.Their report, known as a 302 after the number of the form that agents fill out, will likely be dry and factual.“They will report what the results are - whether they are exculpatory or not,” said Robert Cromwell, a former agent who oversaw these types of investigations. “The results will stand on their own.”Brett Kavanaugh was criticised for being angry while testifying to the committee on ThursdayFor Prof Ford’s supporters and the Democratic party, it is an essential document, to guarantee the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.But for Mr Kavanaugh’s die-hard defenders, such as South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, it’s a time-wasting distraction.“You can have the FBI, the CIA, and the foreign legion,” he said. “And they’re not going to tell us more than we already know.”Essentially because Jeff Flake, a Republican senator from Arizona, changed his mind at the last minute and said he would only vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh if the FBI investigated first. The idea was floated in the Senate committee hearing by Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware.“I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “falling apart” amid entrenched partisan gridlock.Their reluctance is all due to timing. The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 – if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush’s personal secretary.There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.It\u0027s still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.Key to Mr Kavanaugh’s future are the votes of Mr Flake, plus two undecided Republican women - Susan Collins, for Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Mr Flake held out the possibility of rejecting him for the role.“I’m a conservative. He’s a conservative,” he said. “I plan to support him unless they turn up something - and they might.”And adding to the complexity, two Democrats in heavily-Republican states – Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia – are both up for re-election this year, and are reportedly undecided about Mr Kavanaugh.Then the process starts again. Waiting in the wings are believed to be Amy Coney Barrett, Raymond Kethledge and Thomas Hardiman, chosen from a list of 25 judges selected by the conservative Federalist Society.But that does mean that Mr Trump will not get his first choice of Supreme Court justice in time for the midterms – and you can bet he will use that to galvanise his base, urging his supporters to vote and ensure that he has sympathetic Republicans in Congress.A surge in turnout might be a problem for Democrats.Conservative Party conference day one live: Theresa May refuses to rule out Chequers compromise as she tells critics \u0026#39I do believe in Brexit\u0026#39Pakistan civil servant \u0026#39caught on CCTV stealing wallet from visiting foreign delegation\u0026#39Indonesia tsunami: Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivorsComment: It has only just dawned on the Government that leaving the EU was designed to be difficultMy son was recruited by a county lines drug gangSign up to the \u0026#39s Conservative Party Conference WhatsApp updates for all the latest news, exclusives and analysisYemen\u0026#39s Houthi rebels step up persecution in paranoid Sana\u0026#39aMacedonians head to the polls in key name change referendum that could offer EU and NATO accessionMore TV dramas should explore fathers\u0026#39 struggles with parenthood, BBC\u0026#39s The Cry producer saysMore pressure on HS2 after Commons leader Andrea Leadsom calls for it to be scrappedComment: The terrible truth is that there\u0026#39s no escape from the Facebook data vortexComment: Blame the housing crisis for the tragic decline in pet ownershipMosque has trustee on board who sold phones stolen from teenagersComment: The Eurocrats are expecting us to drop Brexit.

My son has no prospects. We have big economic problems. So I thinking joining the EU and Nato will offer us a better future,” Tiho, a 56-year-old taxi driver in the capital, said.But others deeply resent having to add a geographical qualifier to their country’s name, saying that the title North Macedonia is a humiliation and diminishes the country on the world stage.Greece accuses Macedonia of appropriating its ancient heroes such as this giant statue of Alexander the Great in SkopjeIn a concession from Athens, the language of the country will officially be recognised as Macedonian and citizens’ nationality will be Macedonian.“No one wants to change the name – why would you?” said Simonida Kacarska, the director of the European Policy Institute, a think tank in Skopje.“But the issue has been going on for 27 years and people are sick of it. This is a chance to resolve it. We are making a compromise.”The question that will be put to voters in the referendum is: Are you in favour of membership in the European Union and NATO by accepting the deal between (the) Republic of Macedonia and Republic of Greece?The break in the impasse between the two countries came in June, after months of talks between Zoran Zaev, the Macedonian prime minister, and his Greek counterpart, Alexis Tsipras.Both leaders have stuck their necks out politically and face trenchant opposition from domestic critics.In Macedonia, conservative opposition parties and nationalist groups have called for a boycott of the referendum.“It’s emotional. This is a country whose language and identity have been contested by its neighbours,” said Prof Kacarska, who gained her PhD at Leeds University.“Part of the population is concerned that the change of name will change certain identity markers, even though our nationality and language will be recognised as Macedonian.“The emotional attachment to the issue on both sides is incredible. It is still very high and will be for some time.”Such is the historical animosity between Macedonia and its larger neighbours – Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece – that they are known as “the four wolves”.An ethnic Albanian woman casts her ballot at a polling station in Skopje, MacedoniaPolling stations are open until 7pm local time, with the result expected to be known late on Sunday evening.Nikola Dimitrov, the foreign minister, voted in the centre of the capital, describing the referendum as a “historic cross-roads” and the potential start of a new chapter for the country.“I hope that this will be a smooth democratic process and that people will make the choice to move forward finally.“This is a big, big day for Macedonia and for our friendship with Greece and our other neighbours. I’m excited. It’s also my birthday, so I hope there is an omen in that too.”A key issue is turnout – if it is less than 50 per cent then the referendum result may be seen to lack legitimacy.Mr Zaev, the prime minister, has said that if the no vote wins, he will resign.If the yes vote wins, Skopje will have to make changes to its constitution and then put the deal to parliament for approval.It would also have to be ratified by the Greek parliament, where Mr Tsipras’s coalition partners have said they will vote against it.It is not clear if the prime minister will be able to gather enough votes from other parties to have the accord accepted.Conservative Party conference day one live: Theresa May refuses to rule out Chequers compromise as she tells critics \u0026#39I do believe in Brexit\u0026#39Pakistan civil servant \u0026#39caught on CCTV stealing wallet from visiting foreign delegation\u0026#39Indonesia tsunami: Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivorsComment: It has only just dawned on the Government that leaving the EU was designed to be difficultMy son was recruited by a county lines drug gangSign up to the \u0026#39s Conservative Party Conference WhatsApp updates for all the latest news, exclusives and analysisYemen\u0026#39s Houthi rebels step up persecution in paranoid Sana\u0026#39aMore TV dramas should explore fathers\u0026#39 struggles with parenthood, BBC\u0026#39s The Cry producer saysMore pressure on HS2 after Commons leader Andrea Leadsom calls for it to be scrappedComment: The terrible truth is that there\u0026#39s no escape from the Facebook data vortexComment: Blame the housing crisis for the tragic decline in pet ownershipMosque has trustee on board who sold phones stolen from teenagersComment: The Eurocrats are expecting us to drop Brexit.

But in a new BBC drama  the emphasis is on how the father of the child feels and copes with such a tragedy.The Cry promises to hook Sunday evening audiences with the harrowing story of a missing child, told through the pain of both parents.The four-part physcological thriller sees young parents Joanna, played by Victoria star Jenna Coleman and Alistair, played by Ewen Leslie, faced with their child’s disappearance when they travel from Scotland to Australia with their son.Adapted from Helen FitzGerald’s 2013 novel, the series takes a new approach to the story, with new scenes included to show the father\u0027s emotional struggles.As the story unfolds the couple face public scrutiny in a small Australian community, changing their relationship for good.The Cry tells the story of a missing child told through the pain of both parents“In the book, Alistair’s point of view is never portrayed, it’s told inside Joanna’s head,” said Claire Mundell, the show’s executive producer.  “Alistair was vital to the programme. He is also a complex character trying to do the best thing in a terrible situation. “We felt we could add him in to understand this situation properly, it’s not just about the mother.”At first though, the story - which has echoes of one man’s search for his disappeared daughter in the BBC drama The Missing - feels very personal to Joanna who battles with postnatal depression as one part of her experience as a young mother.But Jacquelin Perske, who wrote the screenplay for The Cry, also wanted to focus on the couple’s experience together.She said: “Joanna is not just the victim, we are supposed to see how both of them deal with a very real situation. “They are an extremely average couple hit with terrible circumstances. When one parent is not coping, the other will start to wonder what they can do to help.”The book\u0027s portrayal of Alistair is only through Joanna’s eyes, so the team were left with a fair amount of creative freedom to build their three dimensional version of Alistair. Their choices were integral to how he develops as the story unfolds.Mental health is a strong theme that runs through the new Sunday evening show Mundell said: “We could have easily made Alistair into a monster but that wasn’t interesting to us. “The writing and Ewen Leslie’s performance give more depth to Alistair’s character, he is trying to do what he thinks is the right thing and we see his character go on a journey as well.”Naturally mental health is a strong theme that runs through the show, the narrative es into how our health suffers in traumatic situations. Mundell said: “The story explores mental health full stop, not just male mental health.“Both characters are in a situation of extreme pressure and we wanted to examine how that plays out.”Their focus lead to copious extra research to get it right. Perske specifically cited hours of research into the symptoms of postnatal depression, she said: “I needed to look into what happens if you don’t seek help or treat it.“If people have gone through that, I needed to make sure the story had veracity.” Perske hopes viewers with their own battles will find comfort in how they have approached mental health.She added: “Getting the story right means it can be comforting and even cathartic for women that have been through a similar experience. “It validates them and tells them that they are not alone. This is a very real thing, lots of people go through it and it’s very much a troubled experience.”Conservative Party conference day one live: Theresa May refuses to rule out Chequers compromise as she tells critics \u0026#39I do believe in Brexit\u0026#39Pakistan civil servant \u0026#39caught on CCTV stealing wallet from visiting foreign delegation\u0026#39Indonesia tsunami: Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivorsComment: It has only just dawned on the Government that leaving the EU was designed to be difficultMy son was recruited by a county lines drug gangSign up to the \u0026#39s Conservative Party Conference WhatsApp updates for all the latest news, exclusives and analysisYemen\u0026#39s Houthi rebels step up persecution in paranoid Sana\u0026#39aMacedonians head to the polls in key name change referendum that could offer EU and NATO accessionMore pressure on HS2 after Commons leader Andrea Leadsom calls for it to be scrappedComment: The terrible truth is that there\u0026#39s no escape from the Facebook data vortexComment: Blame the housing crisis for the tragic decline in pet ownershipMosque has trustee on board who sold phones stolen from teenagersComment: The Eurocrats are expecting us to drop Brexit.

They proved so popular, it was hard to take them down. Women of all shapes and sizes grinned from the walls on their bikes: Muslim women with headscarves tucked under helmets, mothers with children strapped on\u0026nbspchild seats. Most were wearing wet-weather gear. This is Glasgow, after all.“So many people engaged with these portraits,” says Shgufta Anwar, a development officer for Bike for Good, a social enterprise that gets people cycling. “I think they were so popular because we’re trying to normalise women on bikes in the area and it isn’t the norm, at the moment.”Anwar runs many of the programmes out of Bike For Good’s community hub,\u0026nbspwhich opened in May last year\u0026nbspon Victoria Road on Glasgow’s Southside. The organisation was founded by Greg Kinsman-Chauvet after he learned to ride a bike\u0026nbspaged\u0026nbsp30 and found it to be a life-changing experience. He liked cycling so much he moved to Glasgow, sold his car and quit his job to volunteer.The charity arm of Bike for Good started with a small stall in Barras Market in July 2010, teaching people the mechanics of the bike and how to cycle safely. It has since expanded to include a for-profit social enterprise that makes money refurbishing bikes and selling them on. Anything that can’t be used is stripped and sold on as parts, to stop as many bikes and parts as possible from going to landfill.\u0026nbspBike for Good now employs more than 50 people. It is one of several cycling organisations in Glasgow working to meet the Scottish government’s target: for bikes to be used for 10 per cent of journeys made by\u0026nbsp2020, up from the current figure of 2 per cent. (As things are, hitting that target will take 350 years.)But there are positive signs on the front line. The Southside branch of Bike for Good is already outgrowing its premises and looking to relocate to somewhere larger. The main reason it needs more space? More bikes. For most, the key barrier to cycling is not owning a bicycle.\u0026nbspNextbike, a rental city bike scheme, offers over 500 bikes at 63 stations across the city for an annual fee of £60. This is too pricey for many. So Bike for Good joined with other cycling organisations in the city to offer loan bikes for £3 to refugees and other communities on Southside. It tops up the Nextbike supply with its own refurbished loan bikes, which have grown in number from 10 to more than 40.“For some people £60 is nothing, but for some people £60 is everything,” says Anwar. Then there are other barriers. Some people live or work far from the bike stations, others don’t have a smartphone to make the rental or good enough English to understand the process. Bike for Good worked with the other cycle groups to find interpreters to speak to potential cyclists. They welcome newcomers into the Southside hub to hire the bikes, rather than forcing people to sign up\u0026nbspon the phone. The work is ongoing. In its first phase of the project, surveys showed some people without financial barriers were taking the cheaper bikes. Now they are looking at targeting specific groups.\u0026nbsp“We’re also running training because a lot of people lack confidence on the roads,” says Anwar.\u0026nbsp“It’s not just, ‘Here’s a bike, off you go’, it’s support for them as well.”Govanhill is the most erse neighbourhood of Scotland, with more than 50 languages spoken across just 13 housing blocks. It is also the focus of the South City Way, a £6.5m\u0026nbspinvestment by the Scottish government into improved cycle paths to connect different parts of the city and promote cycling as an environmentally friendly, healthy activity. Anwar and the Bike for Good team now have a big job on their hands: to encourage the erse communities of Govanhill to believe that cycling is for them.“One particular culture barrier we had was clothing. People don’t want to wear Lycra, they want to be able to cycle in whatever they wear,” says\u0026nbspAnwar. Most of the Bike for Good fleet are step-through bikes with a low bar. “The ladies love these bikes, particularly for the Muslim and Asian communities because they’re wearing something a bit looser and longer on their figure.”Uber to shift focus to electric bikes and scooters for short tripsHow e-bikes make you feel like you\u0027re incredibly good at cyclingLack of bike lanes \u0027putting off more than half of potential cyclists\u0027Pedal Pathways, Bike for Good’s cycling group aimed at women, has now worked with more than\u0026nbsp200 women from across Glasgow. Sixty per cent of those surveyed said their health and wellbeing had improved thanks to the sessions, which can include yoga, bike maintenance, healthy food and, of course,\u0026nbspa bike ride.\u0026nbsp“The majority of people that come into us with barriers are ladies,” Anwar says. “Some of them are estranged, some of them are not talking to anyone other than their family members, or they’re migrants, they might have been through horrific experiences. The social aspect is really important.”For some of these communities, cycling is something people do if they can’t drive, Anwar says. “People say, ‘Now we have cars, why would you cycle?’” she says. “So you have to get them to think of the health aspect and the environment aspect. It’s about getting people to realise that at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what you look like, you’re all the same underneath and you’re there for a common purpose, which is to ride a bike.”bike for goodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Therefore, we intend to vote against Unilever’s proposed resolution.”Investors should not despair – Unilever can still stay in the FTSE 100Unilever hikes idend and announces €6bn share buy-backLondon may be losing Unilever’s HQ but it must not lose its sharesUnilever, which has been based in Britain for almost a century, reviewed its dual-headed corporate structure in the aftermath of an attempted $143bn takeover from Kraft Heinz last year, as Dutch laws offer more comprehensive protections against hostile takeovers. Bosses have since tried to convince investors that their proposed Dutch incorporation will “create a simpler, more agile and more focused company”.Unilever needs at least 75 per cent of votes of London-listed shareholders in order to get the green light for an exodus from the capital.Mr Sadan added: “As a supportive shareholder in Unilever for more than 25 years, we have engaged with the company on a number of issues including its decision to unify its corporate structure. \u0026nbspWe asked the company to ensure that any approach they take safeguards the ability of our clients to maintain their investment and benefit from Unilever’s continued success.”LGIM’s decision to vote against the relocation plans of the UK’s third largest company mirrors the opposition expressed by other shareholders, including Brewin Dolphin, Lindsell Train and Columbia Threadneedle.Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: “We aren’t convinced that the move will realise tangible benefits for shareholders and plan to vote against.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

You can only imagine the producers’ faces as they watched Craig and co annihilate one dance after the other, failing to find anything to get excited about.\u0026nbspIt picked up after the first few numbers though, and Danny, Faye, Joe and Ashley all got rave reviews. They loved Kate’s sultry tango with Aljaz too.\u0026nbspThe relief got to Tess and she started laughing uncontrollably at one of Claudia’s only mildly amusing jokes, which was a bit awkward. Oh and Rob Beckett read out the Ts and Cs while Bruno managed another reference to Bodyguard. (When will he move onto Killing Eve like the rest of us? Maybe Halloween week?).Here’s what everyone is talking about as they await tomorrow night’s results…Joe Sugg is really having a moment. Sure, he’s been a YouTube sensation for some time, but now the mainstream are falling in love with him too. Everyone adores him, even though he’s dancing to Cotton Eye Joe, dressed a roof thatcher – superstardom beckons.His jive really hit the spot tonight, but Seann and Katya’s failed to impress. They weren’t in time to the music and panic set in. It didn’t help that they danced to Elton John’s I’m Still Standing, the music used for Jill Halfpenny’s iconic glitterball-clinching routine in series two, which is still being talked about more than a decade later. Surely Katya should have known better. Still, the judging gave Shirley and Seann a chance to make up, as she now likes his hair. Which is a relief for all of us.But Danny is hot on their heels. Faye and Giovanni’s Viennese Waltz will have alienated viewers who like a traditional approach – it was really an Argentine tango piece of storytelling trapped within a waltz. Of course it was beautifully executed though, and the judges loved it. Ashley’s silver tassled cha cha to Boogie Wonderland was an instant crowd-pleaser and allowed her to claim the top spot on the leaderboard, relegating Faye to number two. But don’t make the mistake of thinking this is a two-horse race – Danny is absolutely killing it. He’s feeling all those rehearsals in his feet and legs, but out on the dance floor he looks fabulous. One to watch.Vicky Gill and her team do an incredible job in the Strictly costume department, but every serues nightmares still happen. Janette Manrara is a salsa specialist and Dr Ranj is a brilliant student, so their routine should have been a highlight. But disaster struck when part of Janette’s dress got stuck on the heel of her shoe, restricting her movement for a good 20 seconds. Dr Ranj must have been secretly horrified but, props to him, you couldn’t see it on his face. He did a brilliant job, to much acclaim from the judges, but you can’t help feeling it could have been better. Shame.Janette Manrara\u0027s dress got stuck on the heel of her shoe as she danced with Dr Ranj Singh. (PA)Lauren has spoken very openly about two things so far this series. One: how she wants to inspire other girls with disabilities to feel that they can dance. Two: that she’s a competitive athlete by trade and wants to win. It was probably a heady mix of these two considerations that made her agree to sit on AJ’s shoulders during their Charleston and then fall face forward towards the floor with only one hand to catch herself. It really was a wow moment. If only the rest of the routine had been as exhilarating…Susannah and Anton finished at the bottom of the leaderboard, with Graeme and Oti, Seann and Katya and Katie and Gorka just above them. Tomorrow night we’ll face the first dance-off of the series (which seemed to come as a shock to Dr Ranj, like a child discovering Santa Claus isn’t real) and two couples will be fighting to make it through to Movie Week next time. Anton has his own very loyal army of fans, so don’t expect to see him waving goodbye tomorrow. It’s the couples in that dangerous mid-leaderboard position that should be worried.

But NOA\u0027s pitch is that it\u0027s not a competition at all, and that audio can be about showing off some of the best traditional journalism in an entirely new setting.While audio is perhaps the oldest of all forms of media, the ways it is being delivered to people isn\u0027t at all. The advent of Amazon\u0027s Alexa, for instance, heralded an entirely new form of listening within the home, favouring on-demand cuts of information that can be requested by shouting while doing the washing up traditional radio still exists but it is increasingly being delivered over the internet when people ask, rather than as traditional broadcast.And the growth of ways to listen has come with an expansion of the listening public, too. With on-demand audio, people have come to see (or hear) that there are various times of the day that go largely unfilled, and it\u0027s apps like NOA – as well as other major audio companies like Audible – that are rushing into stop them being so silent.Amazon Alexa will now listen for strangers in your houseNOA works in a relatively simple way: its team take the best of their partners\u0027 written content, have a narrator record it, and push it out into the world. Its audience can then listen however and whenever they want, simply by opening up the app on their phone or asking Alexa to do it for them.The great thing about it is the time you have each day to consume visual content is limited, says Gareth Hickey, co-founder and CEO at NOA. You might take a quick look at a screen in the morning, and an hour or two in the evening. And that time can be filled up not just with news or other media like on demand television and Netflix, but also social media, emails and WhatsApp.Audio, however, doesn\u0027t have to compete: it can be done while driving, walking, exercising or doing something else entirely, and so can be a complement rather than distraction.About half of NOA\u0027s consumption comes between 7am and 9am. That gap in the day there just gets a lot of traffic – it\u0027s people that are usually commuting.There are of course many companies vying for that time too, many of them new. Everything from the shortest podcast to the longest of Audible\u0027s audiobook is intended to take on that market.But there is an awful lot of that time, too, and it is often spent doing a variety of different things. That means that companies like NOA seeing themselves as complementing podcasts rather than challenging them.That\u0027s useful become some companies like the New York Times have invested heavily in podcasts.They try much own that experience, and they\u0027re doing a great job with that. They\u0027re putting a huge amount of thought and time into getting that right.Instead, NOA focuses on the traditional articles that continue to do so well for those publishers. It is not about the kind of lengthier chats that often make up the meat of podcasts, but rather taking the quality content that news organisations are already producing it and recording it so people can listen to it another way.The style of content that we tend to lean more and more towards is the opinion, analysis, features, he says. The kind of articles that you might come across on a busy Monday afternoon and might not have the time to read.When people do come to those articles, they tend to spend a decent amount of time: about 85 per cent of people coming to an article will finish it, and they\u0027ll stay for an average of four-and-a-half minutes.NOA, of course, has some of the same struggles as every other news publisher. One of them is ensuring that people feel they can make their way through the vast amount of information that\u0027s out there in a way that\u0027s comprehensive and meaningful – without feeling completely overwhelming.One of the things we\u0027re moving towards has been an attempt to bring finish-ability to news topics, he says. It\u0027s all very well reading one piece about Brexit or business or whatever else, but with those huge issues it cane difficult to know where to start or where to end.One approach that NOA has been taking is to gather those topics up into playlists. One about electric cars, for instance, might include a more general overview on the industry, a e into the cobalt shortage that is threatening the batteries that power them, and a look at the latest scandal Tesla and Elon Musk have become embroiled in.It all helps to make people feel like it\u0027s possible to reach the end of the news, even if it\u0027s just to find that some more news has happened. When there is such an often overwhelming amount of stories – and stories about those stories – NOA like other more traditional publishers in seeking ways to cut through the noise.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They were sent back over a distance of around 180 million miles.They come after the space agency successfully landed two rovers on the asteroid, dropping them from a spacecraft floating just above the surface.The rovers dropped down onto the asteroid by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft are the first mobile exploration robots ever to land on an asteroid\u0027s surface. The images they are sending back are the first time that anything has ever autonomously moved and taken pictures themselves on asteroid, too.One of the pictures includes the shadow of the antenna and pin of the rover itself.​ The pin – which is the long line that can be seen sticking out of the rover – helps increase friction when they engage in the hops that they use to jump around the surface, among other purposes.Jaxa, the Japanese space agency, says that both of the rovers are in good condition and are transmitting images and data. The pictures they are sending back have confirmed that they are moving themselves around the asteroid\u0027s surface.The rovers will spend their time exploring the planet\u0027s surface by being joined by yet another visitor,\u0026nbspcalled Mascot, built by scientists in Germany and France, that will further explore the surface.The new pictures are the second batch to be sent down by the\u0026nbspHayabusa-2 spacecraft.

Lusher\u0026nbspfinds\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspeast London building’s history, rooted in the poverty of the Victorian era, is repeating itselfClick to followThe IndependentThe early residents of Toynbee Hall, with Rev Samuel Barnett sitting to the right of his wife HenriettaIt stands where gastropubs now jostle beside the old East End of Petticoat Lane market, where streets are overshadowed by the gleaming towers of the modern City of London.\u0026nbspAmid such bustle, it is easy to overlook the lower rise, altogether more modest Toynbee Hall, and still easier to miss its significance.\u0026nbspYet this is the place that provided formative experiences for two key architects of the welfare state, William Beveridge and Clement Attlee. \u0026nbspThis is the place that can claim a pivotal role in the creation of social justice initiatives such as\u0026nbspthe Child Poverty Action Group.\u0026nbspIt is where the Poor Man’s Lawyer scheme started in 1898, and where free legal advice is still offered today – along with debt counselling, investigation of social problems and many other community services.More than a century after Toynbee Hall opened in 1884, it remains a place of pilgrimage for researchers and innovators the world over, seeking out the institution where so much began, and where so much is still being done.\u0026nbspAnd now, after a £17m restoration and redevelopment, chief executive Jim Minton is determined the reopening of the Grade II listed building should be marked by an exhibition showcasing Toynbee Hall’s history as a “powerhouse for social change”\u0026nbspand suggesting what it could do in the future.“So much did happen here and so much has been inspired by here,” he says.\u0026nbsp“This is a great moment to open the place back up again, to show the community what they have achieved and to say, ‘Let’s achieve even more in the future’.\u0026nbspBecause the problems have not gone away”20th century (Toynbee Hall Archives)There is, of course, a certain irony in that last point.Toynbee Hall was created to help lift the East End out of poverty but continues to confront\u0026nbspthe same issues of low incomes, high debt and poor housing that affected the area in 1884 – with contemporary twists.Since the\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvote,\u0026nbspsays Minton, “our free legal advice service has started dealing with questions from people from other parts of Europe who have heard something, or been told something by their employer.”While in the 1880s the head of Toynbee Hall described casual labour – the system that saw men massing outside dockyard gates hoping to be picked for a day’s work – as “the hardest problem of east London”, there seems something of a modern echo when\u0026nbspMinton notes: “Over the past 10\u0026nbspyears, we have seen a significant change towards in-work poverty, among people in insecure employment, or on zero-hours contracts.”And yet, when Toynbee Hall opened in the 1880s, it did so during a decade that was supposed to herald a new and better beginning.\u0026nbsp“It was the end of an epoch,” recalled Winston Churchill.\u0026nbsp“The great victories had been won.\u0026nbspSlaves were free.\u0026nbspConscience was free.\u0026nbspTrade was free.\u0026nbspBut hunger and squalor were also free and the people demanded something more than liberty.”Minton\u0026nbspsees parallels today with 1818: low income, high debt, and poor housing\u0026nbsp(Toynbee Hall)In 1883, Reverend Andrew Mearns\u0026nbspwould shock middle-class Victorians with\u0026nbspThe Bitter Cry of Outcast London, his pamphlet exposing the horrors within the “rotting and reeking tenement houses” of London’s “great dark region of poverty, misery and immorality”.In 1888,\u0026nbspJack the Ripper would add fresh horror with his Whitechapel murders, virtually\u0026nbspon Toynbee Hall’s doorstep.\u0026nbspAnd in the\u0026nbspparish of St Jude’s – occupied despite the\u0026nbspbishop’s warning that it was “perhaps the worst district in London” – Reverend Samuel Barnett and his wife Henrietta were\u0026nbspwell-placed to separate grim reality from lurid sensationalism.The reality was plenty bad enough.\u0026nbspIt featured whole families living in a single room, whole neighbourhoods sharing a single lavatory, with sewers running down the middle of streets.\u0026nbspAnd yet the casual labourer was often paying more in rent per cubic foot than the rich of South Kensington.\u0026nbspThe precariousness of his income meant landlords felt justified in charging higher rents to cover themselves against inability to pay or moonlight flits – an early example, perhaps, of what is now known as the “poverty premium”.In 1883 Rev\u0026nbspBarnett was able to return to his old university to speak at the Oxford Union, and to win by unanimous vote the motion that “the condition of the poor in our large towns is a national disgrace”.\u0026nbspAnd he found a receptive audience when, in November 1883, he came “as a prophet”\u0026nbspto talk to a small group of graduates at St John’s College, Oxford, urging them, as one listener recalled, to “share the life of that dim and strange other world of east London”.For the Barnetts, this “university settlement”, proposed eight months after Karl Marx’s death, would help show the people demanding something more than liberty that they did not need to go as far as revolution.“The poor,” Rev Barnett\u0026nbspwrote in 1895, “think progress is to be won by revolution.”\u0026nbsp But\u0026nbsphe believed\u0026nbspprojects such as\u0026nbspToynbee Hall could help preach “the good news of a unity greater than rich or poor … Humanity will help the poor see the rich as their brothers, and God as their father.”Gustave ​Doré’s\u0026nbspimage of the slums of Victorian London may have been sensationalised for a middle-class audience but the reality was\u0026nbspbad enough (Alamy)Rev Barnett and the\u0026nbspforceful, equally accomplished Henrietta\u0026nbsphoped the young Oxford men would do in the city something akin to what the gentry was supposed to do in the countryside: befriending the poor and showing them how to lead better, fuller lives.\u0026nbspThe Barnetts’ vision, however, also contained large doses of humility.Before devising any bright ideas of their own, the Oxford men were supposed to learn from the poor among whom they were going to live.\u0026nbsp“The needs of east London are often urged,” Rev Barnett told them, “but they are little understood.\u0026nbspHe who has, even for a month, shared the life of the poor can never rest again in his old thoughts.”And so began the building, in the heart of the East End, of something resembling an Oxbridge college.\u0026nbspNamed Toynbee Hall, after the Barnetts’ recently deceased kindred spirit Arnold Toynbee, the Oxford historian credited with coining the term “the Industrial Revolution”,\u0026nbspit opened its doors for the first time in 1884.\u0026nbspRev Barnett was the first warden.\u0026nbspThe volunteer residents\u0026nbspdined in a hall adorned with the crests of their old Oxbridge colleges.\u0026nbspThey were soon offering help, solidarity and a rather mind-boggling array of activities to the East End.In one of the most definitive accounts of the early years of Toynbee Hall, Professor Emily Abel described how East End errand boy Ernest Baker found himself assisting in the running of the Toynbee Hall Elizabethan Literary Society.The Natural History Society broadened East Enders’ horizons by taking them into the countryside, and under the tutelage of some of the more vigorous volunteer residents, the Toynbee Travellers’ Club introduced the London poor to the joys of mountain climbing in the Swiss Alps.As Prof Abel noted, Toynbee Hall’s early residents did not always avoid being clumsily patronising –\u0026nbspone suggested the Shakespeare Club could counteract east Londoners’ “inability to amuse themselves rationally”.Created with Sketch.NHS at 70: Pride and worry as free health service celebrates birthday Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nurses test the hearing of

cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalAmong those present was a shabbily dressed character who said his name was Richter.\u0026nbspIn broken English, he berated Morley for supporting the imperialist foreign policy of Britain and other “capitalist nations”.“Go down to Limehouse or Shadwell and see how the people live,” said Richter.\u0026nbsp“Their slums, impoverishment, degradation and prostitution!\u0026nbsp That’s where your foreign policy should lie.\u0026nbspThey are the victims of your capitalist organisation which is just as powerful and cruel as the force of arms.”Morley and others politely begged to differ –\u0026nbspso politely that Richter was invited back to Toynbee Hall for tea a few days later.William Bowman, a Toynbee Hall resident who was present at the tea, recalled how Richter, “who seemed hungry”, tucked into the cakes and was particularly fascinated by the buttered muffins, which he had never tried before.But he wouldn’t budge from his belief in violent revolution.“History has shown,” he told the Toynbee Hall residents between mouthfuls of cake and muffins, “that no great change has been brought about without the shedding of blood and revolution.”Eventually he declared: “I have enjoyed this talk, but now my time is up.\u0026nbspI must go to visit my friends in Limehouse.”Richter\u0026nbspshook hands with the assembled company and departed.\u0026nbspOnly much later did the Toynbee Hall residents realise that they had in fact been having tea with the exiled Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin.In a gentler way, some of the stances taken by Toynbee Hall and its residents have been, if not revolutionary, then at least profoundly challenging to conventional wisdom.\u0026nbspEven as the hall opened, the Barnetts were\u0026nbspin the process of parting ways with the Charity Organisation Society (COS), which had started in 1869 as the Society for Organising Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicity.Much emphasis was placed on repressing mendicity\u0026nbsp– begging.\u0026nbspRather as some now rail against a perceived “benefits culture”, the social reformer Octavia Hill, a driving force in the COS, firmly believed that indiscriminate alms-giving “degraded” the poor, making them happy to rely on charity and unable or unwilling to support themselves through hard work.In a possible echo of the current debates around fit-to-work benefits tests, it was believed that extensive scrutiny of applications for “relief” was needed to distinguish the virtuous but luckless worker from the “clever pauper”.“The main tone of action,” maintained Hill, “must be severe.\u0026nbspThere is much of rebuke and repression needed, although a deep and silent undercurrent of pity may flow beneath.”In the eyes of the Fabian Beatrice Webb, the Barnetts “discovered that there was a deeper evil than unrestrained charity, namely unrestricted and unregulated capitalism and landlordism.”And so in 1888 the matchgirls of the East End found allies in Toynbee Hall when they went on strike, protesting against pitiful wages and factory conditions that included white phosphorous fumes destroying jawbones, giving\u0026nbspmatch-makers “phossy-jaw”.In an early example of Toynbee Hall residents learning from their East End neighbours, a group of them made their own investigations, then helped shape public opinion with letters to The Times detailing the matchgirls’ “deplorable conditions” and below-subsistence wages.\u0026nbspAfter its first warden Samuel Barnett died in 1913, it could be said that Toynbee Hall rose to other challenges.\u0026nbspOn Sunday 4 October\u0026nbsp1936 Oswald Mosley tried to march his uniformed blackshirts through the East End.\u0026nbspJewish groups, trade unionists and leftwingers mobilised to block the fascists’ path with barricades and cries of “They shall not pass!”When the police tried to clear a route for the British Union of Fascists, the “Battle of Cable Street” began.\u0026nbspThe fascists did not pass.\u0026nbspDefeated by the dogged East Enders, police commissioner Sir Philip Game was forced to tell Mosley to march west, out of the area.A week later, however, in what became known as the Mile End Pogrom, about 200 fascists smashed up Jewish shops and houses in the Mile End Road, even throwing a young child and elderly Jewish man through a window.Toynbee Hall warden Jimmy Mallon was appalled.\u0026nbspHe called a meeting at Toynbee Hall that led to the creation of a Council of Citizens of East London, which then issued a notice to be displayed in shops and workplaces.\u0026nbsp“Citizens of East London,” the notice warned.\u0026nbsp “Forces are at work to destroy the common sense and toleration and good humour on which we pride ourselves.\u0026nbspWe must work against these forces.\u0026nbspBoycott provocative demonstrations.\u0026nbspMaintain calm and good temper.\u0026nbspStand together for fair play.”Meanwhile, Jimmy Mallon joined a delegation that persuaded the government of the need for what became the Public Order Act 1936.It banned the wearing of uniforms for political purposes, as well as enhancing police powers to deal with marches.Profumo found redemption at Toynbee Hall, rising from dishwasher to chairman (Toynbee Hall Archives)Such achievements are, perhaps, one answer to the sour aside of East Ender and future Labour leader George Lansbury, who in 1928 wrote that Toynbee Hall was used as a stepping stone by ambitious young careerists who would eventually claim that: “The interests of the poor were best served by leaving east London to stew in its own juice while they became members of parliament, cabinet ministers, civil servants.”Had he lived long enough, Lansbury might have added that Toynbee Hall was also used by at least one ex-cabinet minister to forge a new, post-scandal career.It is often recalled that in 1963, after being caught lying to parliament about his affair with Christine Keeler, John Profumo began a new career washing dishes at Toynbee Hall, rising to become chairman in 1982 and “learning humility” in the process.\u0026nbspBut it is often forgotten how much Profumo achieved at Toynbee Hall.\u0026nbspHe raised funds, helped ease overcrowding through involvement in the Toynbee Housing Association, and backed potentially controversial schemes like the “Grendon outpost”, providing aftercare for former psychiatric-prison inmates.In what could have been another riposte to George Lansbury, William Beveridge freely acknowledged that his coming to Toynbee Hall, aged 24, in 1903 had been the stepping stone to other things.\u0026nbspBut in the same breath, he said that none of his later achievements would have been possible without the “special knowledge … gained in Whitechapel”.During his two years at Toynbee Hall, Beveridge was able, he later recalled, “to learn about the main economic problem of those days, not from books, but by interviewing unemployed applicants for relief”.And Beveridge’s recommendations were implemented by the post-war government of fellow Toynbee alumnus Clement Attlee, who spent a year as the hall’s secretary in 1910.\u0026nbspAttlee came to Toynbee Hall with prior experience of the East End, having been the manager of Stepney Boys’ Club and an assistant to Beatrice Webb.In his 1920 book Social Worker, the Oxford-educated former public schoolboy revealed some of the lessons the East End had taught him.I met a small boy in the street one day.Attlee (first left) at Toynbee Hall in 1910 (Courtesy of Anne, Countess Attlee)Echoing the Barnetts’\u0026nbspgrowing distaste for the COS, while seemingly anticipating some of the thinking behind – and modern arguments about – the welfare state, Attlee inveighed against\u0026nbsp“the suggestion that those in need of relief should be passed through a sort of sieve”“They will spend much time finding ways in which small wages may be made to go a long way, without considering whether those wages should not be raised, or recognising that the claim to a share in the better things of life which is expressed in the purchase of luxuries is a more hopeful thing than submission to low wages.”In the newly restored Toynbee Hall, Jim Minton expresses pride in the connection to men like Attlee and Beveridge. But he is careful to temper such pride with a recognition of the work still to be done.\u0026nbspDespite 134 years of “progress”, despite the wealth represented by those gleaming City of London towers, the East End – still – contains two of the three worst-rated UK parliamentary constituencies for child poverty.\u0026nbspAnd in 2015, the last time such official statistics were compiled, the east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham were ranked the worst local authority areas in the country for income-deprivation among older people.Child food poverty ‘sparks return of Victorian scourges’Nearly half of all children in London and Birmingham ‘live in poverty’Government must tackle ‘slum’ conditions faced by private rentersMy forefather’s life in Manchester’s slumsTower Hamlets, Toynbee Hall’s local borough, has about 2,000 homeless families in temporary accommodation and in 2015 just over a quarter of its population was found to be living in income deprivation.“We are talking every day to people who have financial problems,” says\u0026nbspMinton.\u0026nbsp“There are still huge amounts of poverty in east London.“The learning process that Attlee and Beveridge and hundreds of other less famous people would have gone through at Toynbee Hall,” says Minton, “would have been about challenging, and saying: ‘This is unacceptable.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening, and what can we do about it?’”“That,” he declares, “is very much the spirit we want to keep alive.”\u0026nbsp‘Toynbee Hall: A Powerhouse for Social Change’ is open Monday-Friday and on the third weekend of every month at Toynbee Hall, 28 Commercial Street, London, E1 6LSBattle of Cable StreetShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It doesn’t do either what the referendum led people to expect, bringing back control of laws, in fact it explicitly doesn’t do that.“It doesn’t bring back control of borders, so those two things straight away – there’s much more than that.”The former cabinet minister distanced himself from Mr Johnson however, who had in the morning papers appeared to attack the PM, as well as her proposals.Mr Davis said that regardless of his criticism of her approach, he would still back Ms May in any vote of confidence and criticized Mr Johnson for conflating leadership and policy issues.Brexiteers want a food fight, but won\u0027t face the truth about trade\u0027Significant\u0027 number of Tory MPs would back new Brexit vote- GrieveMay accuses her Brexit critics of ‘playing politics’- liveBritain to hold post-Brexit festival, Theresa May announcesAsked if Mr Johnson would make a good leader, Mr Davis said: “You take what he said this morning in the papers – he talks about cancelling HS2 and spending it on a bridge to Northern Ireland.“Well, I don’t want to do that, I think one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas, that cost a fortune and don’t do much good, and that would be one of them.”Ms Davidson called the language that Mr Johnson had used in his attacks on her plans unwise.She also questioned Mr Johnson’s claims that he only backed Ms May’s plans while foreign secretary last December, because the prime minister misled him over critical elements.Ms Davidson said: “This is someone who was praising what the prime minister had brought home in terms of moving on to the next stage last December, someone who was in one of the great offices of state, who was sitting round the cabinet table, who now says that he was in some way deceived.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“I don’t sit around the cabinet table I’m not in government…but I knew what was being said in December, I’m not sure how the former foreign secretary didn’t.”Ms Davidson called the PM’s proposals “credible”, adding: “There is a deal to be done and I support the prime minister in getting it.“Part of what the party should be doing is giving her space to get in and get the job done.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

Absolutely.”The EU sees Brexit talks as Britain’s ‘managed capitulation’The comments are the strongest evidence yet that moderate Tories are flexing their muscles to prevent Theresa May carrying out her threat to allow the UK to crash out of the EU if necessary.Some senior cabinet ministers are also believed to be alarmed that the UK could end up facing a no-deal Brexit “by accident” and want the prime minister to adopt looser, Canada-style\u0026nbsptrade proposals as a fallback.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, Ms Rudd warned hardline anti-Brexit Tory MPs that continuing to obstruct Ms May’s efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels could backfire on them.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think no deal will happen,” she said, arguing a Norway-style EEA deal\u0026nbsp– effectively keeping the UK in the EU single market – remained a possibility.And she said: “It would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexity people in my party were unable to support the prime minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“So I think they have to think very carefully about the consequences of not supporting a negotiated settlement.”The Independent has launched its Final Say campaign, to give the British people the crucial decision on any Brexit deal.

public to decide what they want us to do next\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsHeidi Allen has become the latest Conservative MP to back a Final Say Brexit referendum, arguing there is now “no alternative”.The prominent backbencher said that, with the Chequers proposals “dead” and the threat to jobs from crashing out of the EU without a deal, the decision had to be thrown back to the public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She told BBC Radio 4 that she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister but that it was now clear many in her party would not.Her comments came as the Conservative faithful gather in Birmingham for the party’s annual conference and after Mr Johnson’s latest broadside against the prime minister’s negotiating stance.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s

Therefore, we intend to vote against Unilever’s proposed resolution.”Investors should not despair – Unilever can still stay in the FTSE 100Unilever hikes idend and announces €6bn share buy-backLondon may be losing Unilever’s HQ but it must not lose its sharesUnilever, which has been based in Britain for almost a century, reviewed its dual-headed corporate structure in the aftermath of an attempted $143bn takeover from Kraft Heinz last year, as Dutch laws offer more comprehensive protections against hostile takeovers. Bosses have since tried to convince investors that their proposed Dutch incorporation will “create a simpler, more agile and more focused company”.Unilever needs at least 75 per cent of votes of London-listed shareholders in order to get the green light for an exodus from the capital.Mr Sadan added: “As a supportive shareholder in Unilever for more than 25 years, we have engaged with the company on a number of issues including its decision to unify its corporate structure. \u0026nbspWe asked the company to ensure that any approach they take safeguards the ability of our clients to maintain their investment and benefit from Unilever’s continued success.”LGIM’s decision to vote against the relocation plans of the UK’s third largest company mirrors the opposition expressed by other shareholders, including Brewin Dolphin, Lindsell Train and Columbia Threadneedle.Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: “We aren’t convinced that the move will realise tangible benefits for shareholders and plan to vote against.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We are investigating, and we have already contacted the Information Commissioner, and will be putting in a fuller report to them.We\u0027ve spoken to the company that supplied it, who themselves have put out a statement apologising for the error that they made.This will affect people where somebody has guessed or already known somebody\u0027s email address and was therefore able to log in as them. So, it will be a limited number of our delegates here and we are contacting the delegates to outline to them what has happened and what they can do about that.Asked whether he considered resigning over the app issue, Mr Lewis said: At the moment I\u0027m focused on making sure that conference goes well.

They want us to get on with it. The problem with a second referendum is that it will just reopen, I think, all the isions that emerged in 2016.\u0026ldquoWhat I want to see is a reasonable deal that allows us to get on with things, but also concentrate on some of those massive issues that people had around the country where they voted Leave.\u0026ldquoCommunities like Doncaster and\u0026nbspelsewhere\u0026nbspdidn\u0026rsquot feel they were getting a better share of the national wealth that they were entitled to.

She said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos going to be very difficult to have a general election, even if nobody wants any deal the Prime Minister brings back with, because of the fixed term parliament.\u0026ldquoI think a lot of MPs who might say publicly they might like a general election, but actually, in\u0026nbsppractice\u0026nbspdo they really want it, on both sides?\u0026ldquoThe electorate at the moment is very volatile and no-one can take for granted\u0026nbspthe electorate\u0027s vote\u0026nbspand how they are going to vote no matter what they did in the past.Brexit news: Labour MP\u0027s discussed whether there should be a People\u0027s Vote at conference (Image: EXPRESS\u0026bull)British entrepreneur John Mills commented on whether the People\u0026rsquos Vote was picking up \u0026ldquomomentum.

We\u0026rsquove got a long way to go in this process, ironically in a short amount of time.He added: \u0026ldquoI think the best way to get a sensible Brexit negotiated is to have a change of Government. Because if the Prime Minister has boxed herself in and has nowhere to go now\u0026hellipwe would have a very different kind of Brexit if a Labour Government was elected.The prospect of a change of leadership was echoed by Labour\u0026rsquos shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon who said a general election is a real possibility.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not in Labour\u0026rsquos gift to call for a general election but I think a general election is a real possibility and that\u0026rsquos our preference. If a Labour Government is elected in that early general election then what we\u0026rsquoll do is bring the country together.\u0026ldquoAccept and respect the referendum and secure a Brexit that meets the six tests that Keir Starmer has set out.Labour\u0026rsquos shadow communities and local government secretary, Andrew Gwynne, added that Labour did not want to \u0026ldquoreopen the 2016 referendum result as he called for a general election.Mr Gwynne also claimed the Government had \u0026ldquofailed miserably in negotiations with the EU.The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham made clear the Brexit result must be \u0026ldquorespected, claiming that the best outcome would be a \u0026ldquodeal.Mr Burnham added that there could only be a People\u0026rsquos Vote if \u0026ldquofurther down the line a no deal is looking like a possible scenario and would only be acceptable as a \u0026ldquolast resort.However, Labour MP for Exeter Ben Bradshaw claimed that \u0026ldquopeople\u0026rsquos minds are changing as they see the reality of Brexit \u0026ndash particularly the reality of the prospect of a no deal Brexit.He added: \u0026ldquoThe Government has completely failed to deliver Brexit in a competent way and we are facing the prospect of either a very bad deal or no deal at all which would be catastrophic for our economy.Labour MP Caroline Flint explained why the party should not back a People\u0027s Vote (Image: EXPRESS)\u0026ldquoAnd I think in those circumstances, parliamentarians, whatever their political colour, are going to do what they know is in the best interests of their constituents. If the prospect of the choice is between a crash out no deal scenario and another referendum, I think that\u0026rsquos what they would go for.Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton, Graham Stringer, said he did not think there was a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum on leaving the EU.Mr Stringer said the arguments of those calling for a second referendum did not \u0026ldquostack up. He said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think there will be a second referendum, nor should there be.Ronnie Campbell, Labour MP for Blyth Valley, added that the Labour Party needed to be \u0026ldquovery careful about\u0026nbspa second\u0026nbspvote on Europe.He said: \u0026ldquoIf they are saying it is a vote for a no deal, that might be a different matter, because a no deal, we don\u0026rsquot know what a no deal could look like, we could go off an oblivion.\u0026ldquoBut, not on Europe. We have had that referendum. We are leaving Europe. We have got to leave on the best terms possible. And if the Tories can\u0026rsquot do it, there is a Labour Government there waiting to be in.Kent Labour Councillor Brendan Chilton claimed that Leave would win any future Brexit vote by a bigger majority but warned the party about \u0026ldquoalienating working-class voters from the Labour Party.Prominent Labour politicians have joined calls for a People\u0026rsquos Vote after Brexit negotiations, including the London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Addressing the conference on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn insisted Labour would not overturn Brexit but questioned the conduct of the May Government during the negotiations with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoLabour respects the decision of the British people in the referendum but no one can respect the conduct of the government since that vote took place.As it stands, Labour will vote against the Chequers plan or whatever is left of it and oppose leaving the EU with no deal. And it is inconceivable that we should crash out of Europe with no deal \u0026ndash that would be a national disaster.\u0026ldquoThat is why if Parliament votes down a Tory deal or the government fails to reach any deal at all we would press for a general election.

little Amy is clever because she knows all the answers.What he doesn’t realise is that Amy does her homework with her family every night.American comedian Rob Delaney ignited a lively debate when he tweeted: “Why do they give seven-year-olds so much homework in the UK and how do I stop this?I want my kid frolicking and drawing and playing football.”Fellow celebrities Gary Lineker and Jason Manford agreed.Piers Morgan disagreed, calling the arguments “lazy parenting”.I have to disagree too with Mr Delaney and his supporters.Homework is essential for a child’s education because revisiting the day’s learning is what helps to make it stick.So Catastrophe star Rob and Gary Lineker are wrong in attacking compulsory home-work in primary schools.Sure, you’ll get the odd exceptionally bright pupil who will excel just through what she learns at school, despite not having that support at home.But this is very rare.Teaching is not just the teacher’s job.It takes a village to raise a child.Children learn all the time and the environment surrounding them determines how much they learn.Genes play a part in how clever a child is, but how hard they work also matters.Work hard and you’ll learn lots.Work less and you’ll learn less.Don’t make the mistake of thinking homework is for a child to do on their own.When parents use homework to bond and learn together with their child, the child understands that Mum and Dad value learning.And because a child wants to please their parents, the child’s interest in their home-work will grow, year on year.These children can see the benefit of homework and will enjoy doing it because it makes them feel better about themselves.Everyone loves to feel successful.Ten years ago, author Malcolm Gladwell introduced the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.We get better at what we practise, whether it’s football or maths.Our brains have a working memory and a long-term memory.If your times tables are stored in your long-term memory, you will quickly be able to calculate what it will cost to buy 12 apples instead of two.If that knowledge isn’t there, you’ll have to resort to counting on your fingers.The more knowledge stored in long-term memory, the better equipped you’ll be to think imaginatively and solve complex problems.Homework revisits what you learn at school to cement it into your long-term memory.I do agree that some home-work is pointless.Silly craft projects that involve gluing things together, which the parent will inevitably end up doing, hold no value for me.I also understand why some parents don’t like homework — they feel that it’s a battle.Parenting is hard.I get that.But we need to stop thinking of homework as a chore that the child is sent off to do, cutting into the parent’s precious time with them.It shouldn’t be the case on Sunday night that Mum says: “Oh God, it’s homework time — let’s get it over with.”Instead, learning should be part of daily le, and an enriching time for both the parent and the child.Reading with your child for 20 minutes should not be a chore.Asking them to count peas on their plate should not be hard work.While you’re out in the street, talk to them about the world around them.This is the sort of homework that is often set for very young children and it can be done without making it feel like a formal lesson.It doesn’t need to be half an hour sitting at a desk.It can just be ten minutes of enjoyable time together.Homework can be written down but can also be spoken or done online, leaving little marking for the teacher.Secondary-school homework can help you learn with your child.You can learn some French again or be reminded of the beauty of Shakespeare!How wonderful is that?By scaffolding the support at home, you can gradually wean them off it, just like taking off bike stabilisers.Eventually, they learn to work independently, so that when they get to GCSEs, they will be in the habit of doing their homework each night.If you don’t get them into the homework habit from an early age, you risk having a battle with a stroppy teen as they approach their exams.And no parent wants that.Those who are against homework will argue that their children have no time for other hobbies.This is nonsense.Children generally finish school at 3.15pm, and younger ones tend to go to bed at about 8pm.That’s nearly five hours of free time.Are they really spending it playing hockey or going to Brownies?I doubt it.Half an hour of homework in five hours of spare time is a drop in the ocean, leaving lots of time for other things.The real worry for parents should be how much time children are spending on social media — something that is so very dangerous and takes up hours of their time, unlike homework.Katharine Birbalsingh is head of Michaela Community School, North London, and has been dubbed the country’s “strictest head teacher”.She introduced an ultra-disciplined approach to

This, he insisted, would remain free under Labour — but not just to print what it liked. Thick as he is, ­Corbyn sees no contradiction.Then it was on to Jezza curing all our ills with freebies galore and mass job creation, all presumably funded by the same tax on the rich. Since Labour aides now privately admit their 2017 manesto secretly covered up a £1TRILLION bill, Corbyn’s assurances aren’t worth the autocue they are written on.This smug, cocky Labour conference is an annual reminder of just what a dishonest rabble they now are. Sickeningly posing as defenders of the dispossessed while plotting to annul their Brexit votes with a second referendum, brought about by orchestrating chaos.One moronic MP even demanded a General Strike to oust the Government. Frontbencher Richard Burgon stood and applauded. And he is the “next Secretary of State for Justice”, God help us.Corbyn is keen to rebrand his extremism as mainstream in an era when capitalism has “failed”. It is, in reality, a dog-eared hard-left roadmap to ruin on a scale we have never experienced.A Britain which would kill ambition and enterprise and drive out successful firms by stealing their property. Where investors would fear to tread and from which anyone who could would flee.Labour’s candidate for PM is a dim, vain, vindictive, unapologetically anti­-Semitic ball of rage who loathes scrutiny, lies habitually about his true beliefs and past terrorist connections and is, his aides admit, “not good in the mornings”.But the Tories must not mistake all that for a free pass. Corbyn’s plans have traction only because the Government has left the battlefield.Theresa May and Philip Hammond are timid tinkerers when we need radical steps to put more money in pockets and make homes affordable. Socialism is the last thing we need. Next to last are Tory “Corbyn-lite” tax rises.Record job figures, low inflation and interest rates add up to a society and economy far healthier than the dystopia of chippy Corbynite imaginations.But  the Tories don’t fix the problems that DO exist they’re sunk, and Britain too.WELL done to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson for swtly ensuring the kids of dying RAF officer Samantha McConnell will not be denied her pension.Now he must change the rules for good.So others like her get the same deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s crashed and burned.WE hope the poll revealing voters in ­marginal seats deserting the Tories over sky-high rents is enough to stir the ­Government from its paralysis.The Tories are consumed by Brexit.But away from that they must wake up and present radical ideas to beat ­Corbyn’s, especially on housing.They have an advantage.Theirs are more likely to be sane.And vanishingly less likely to put hundreds of thousands on the dole.But Theresa May must realise that voters have more pressing problems than Brexit which could cost her power.Next week the Tories must have a new story to tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past 12 months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past 20 years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number 10 for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet?”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But even  they get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for 2022. The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in 1951 or even the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend 45 minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I dont know what happened to her and my child. I hope they are safe.Horrying footage which emerged shortly after shows the terrying moment people ran screaming after the devastating tsunami smashed the region.The video - reportedly taken on top of a shopping mall - shows the wave building up just off the shore.Just a few seconds later, the 7ft high wave can be seen crashing into the beach, immediately flattening houses in its path and submerging the entire area.Dwikorita Karnawati, who heads Indonesias meteorology and geophysics agency, BMKG, said panic gripped the city after the wave struck.She said the situation was chaotic with people running on the streets and buildings collapsing.Nina, a 23-year-old woman who goes by one name, was working at a laundry service shop not far from the beach when the quake hit.She said the quake destroyed her workplace, but she managed to escape and quickly went home to get her mother and younger brother.The three of us ran, but got separated. Now I dont know where my mother and brother are. I dont know how to get information. I dont know what to do.The quake rocked central Sulawesi in Indonesia just hours after a smaller tremor killed one and injured another 10.The US Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.5 quake was centred at a depth of 6miles about 35 miles northeast of the town of Donggala, Sulawesi.Indonesias meteorology agency initially issued an early tsunami warning for people in Central Sulawesi and West Sulawesi provinces, but this has since been lted.Earlier on Friday, the same area was hit by a magnitude 6.1 earthquake that killed one person, injured 10 and damaged dozens of houses.An official with the local disaster agency, Akris, said: Many houses have collapsed. It happened while we still have dficulties in collecting data from nine villages affected by the first quake. People ran out in panic.Donggala resident Mohammad Fikri said by telephone that he ran from his house but there wasnt great panic in his neighborhood.He said: All the things in my house were swaying and the quake left a small crack on my wall.But this was not the first time. Last week we felt an earthquake that had a stronger tremor so this time we didnt panic, just avoided the buildings and now everything has ed to normal.A series of earthquakes in July and August killed nearly 500 people on the holiday island of Lombok, hundreds of kilometres southwest of Sulawesi.Indonesia sits on the Pacic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.In 2004, a big earthquake measuring 9.1 struck off the northern Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437932409.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"man finds biological dad super sperm donor 1000 siblings","story":"Ivo van Halen, from the Netherlands, was told by his parents only five years ago that he had been conceived using a sperm donation sparking a search for his biological father.However, he was left stunned after genetic testing in Rotterdam identied not just his biological dad but at least 60 half-siblings in the Netherlands alone - and the potential for many more worldwide.Ivo was then informed that his dad was in fact an incredibly prolic sperm donor who had donated to at least three clinics on a regular basis over 20 years.According to one Dutch government agency, he may have fathered up to 1,000 children through his donations, which were supplied to the UK as well as clinics across Europe.The 34-year-old IT professional is now on the hunt to locate as many of his siblings as possible.He discovered his biological truths by using a £60 DNA testing kit from Family Tree DNA, as donor clinics abide by anonymity rules.The testing company lists biological relatives who have taken the same test and goes as far as estimating the relationship - i.e. siblings, parents - using the proportion of shared DNA.People share 50 per cent of their DNA with a parent and around 25 per cent with a half-sibling.Ivo decided to give it a go and submitted a saliva swab, before sitting back and waiting for the results.One month later, he was given the shocking news that he was one of hundreds of babies fathered by the same donor.Speaking to the The Times he said: “I found my biological father and 42 half-siblings right away.”Ivo reached out and made contact with several of his half-siblings, but it took a while longer before he contacted his biological dad.The pair hit it off immediately, with a shared love of puzzles helping them bond.Ivo has also connected with many of his half-brothers and sisters - some of whom grew up close to where he lived as a child.  He said: Some of the others had known each other before they found out they were related and had almost dated. Thats one reason this sort of knowledge is so important.”He is now on the hunt to trace his British siblings, and will use other DNA testing companies in the hope of making more connections.The story of Ivos biological dad can be compared to that of British scientist Bertold Wiesner, who may have fathered 600 children after making donations to a fertility programme he ran with his we."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436737576-e1538236903776.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady the apprentice launch slippery excuses","story":"Sixteen budding entrepreneurs battling it out to win £250k of Lord Sugar’s own money as an investment to start their own business.Alan goes into partnership with the winner — and that’s where Claude Littner and I come in.We are there to make sure he chooses the right person, by watching what happens when the contestants are out on tasks.People know it’s that time of year when they see Claude and I out on the streets with a notepad, pen and film crew.We don’t mentor, we don’t coach or give any guidance, we simply watch what unfolds. And what is amazing to me is how often people try to wriggle out of things and deny a decision they made, in a bid to stay in the process. So when they sit in the boardroom saying, “I didn’t . . . ” we can say, “Oh yes you did . . . ”Some people ask me  certain scenes are staged, but the show is unique in that there are no retakes, there is no setting up of scenes and no trying to find the comedy moment — they just come naturally.All of Alan’s jokes come naturally, too. There is no script, no autocue, it happens as it happens.Luckily, we get on very well — Claude, Alan and I. So much so that we all went on holiday together this year.We’re all quite similar, we have all been married for a long time and we all share the same family values.It makes us a watertight team, although we each bring something dferent to the table.But, parking that for a moment, The Apprentice is also top-notch entertainment — this series more than ever. What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them?Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids 22 years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing 60 women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as 17.He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,  you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one cares  you have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £75 to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s going to die any minute. Say something. She might hear it. The phone is by her ear.’“I said, ‘Tashi I love you so much, darling. I’ll be with you soon. I’ll be with you.”“‘When you’ve got children, you don’t want them to be without you, do you? They haven’t flown the nest.They still need you.“I fell to the ground. I couldn’t talk, I was engulfed with grief. I knew then she was gone.’”Natasha died from a reaction to sesame seeds in a £3.45 artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought at a Heathrow Pret.The meal had no allergy warning on its packaging.Natasha fell ill on a British Airways flight as she, Nadim and a pal headed for a break in the south of France in July 2016. She died in hospital in Nice.At last week’s inquest coroner Sean Cummings slammed Pret for failing to alert customers to potentially fatal allergens.Pret was warned nine times about the dangers of sesame in its artisan baguettes in the year before Natasha died.Toy firm director Tanya, from Fulham, West London, said of the firm: “They screwed up, yes. Now they have the opportunity to do something good. They could lobby for a change to our labelling laws.“We know Natasha didn’t die on our watch. She died on Pret’s watch, all thanks to the absence of two little words.“If the label had listed ‘sesame seeds’ Natasha wouldn’t have touched it and she’d still be alive.“Nadim trusted Natasha knew what to look for.”For dad Nadim the moment they made that choice is replayed over and over in his mind.And the memory brings him to tears. He said: “I hate myself. I blame myself. I really love my daughter, in a way that’s like one flesh.“As a parent I’d die a thousand times, crucied, for her to live.“I spent 15 years nurturing the most precious thing in my le. As a human being, there’s nothing more important than that.“In that moment, how could it be that I failed her? I will live with that until I die, but so it is.“I’m so glad it wasn’t Tanya’s watch because I don’t think she could have taken it’.” Mum Tanya was at home when she got the call at 9.30am.She said: “Nad was crying and said, ‘Tanya you’ve got to come out here. Natasha’s not well. Something terrible has happened.’ Initially I thought, it’s not that bad, I wanted reassurance. But Nad was saying, ‘Start looking for flights. It’s really bad.’“I was praying. Please God, don’t take her from me.”As Natasha was taken to Nice hospital, Tanya raced to Stansted. She said: “The lady at check-in said, I’m sorry, the flight’s full.“I said, ‘You’ve got to get me to France, my daughter’s dying.“Then, we were told there was a delay for six hours. I was constantly crying. Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within two minutes and I had to say goodbye. And I did.“I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all unfolding.“I couldn’t howl, scream or cry as I was surrounded by families. I got on the plane. Tears were falling the whole time.Freshly prepared items at London branches of Greggs, EAT and fast food chains Wasabi and itsu had no allergy warnings on them.Even Pret a Manger is still using the loophole, with no warnings on packets. The law says that when food is prepared onsite, ingredient labelling is not necessary.It is designed to protect small, independent stores.At the busy shops we investigated – EAT, Pret, Wasabi and itsu at Canary Wharf Shopping Mall in East London – allergy information signs were in cabinets, urging customers to ask.But at Greggs in Chrisp Street Market no signs were visible — despite assurances from chiefs that allergy signs were there.Every shop we visited failed to feature any information on packaging for food made in-house.“It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.That he needed my love and understanding. I knew how much he loved Natasha. I felt so much of his pain with mine.”Nadim added: “The last thing she ever said was “Daddy, Daddy, help me. I can’t breathe.” I held her and kept talking to her. Minutes later she was gone.’ Nadim, who is considering suing Pret, added: “I spent a year on the sofa. I wrote two suicide letters. I felt it was so unfair.“We haven’t touched her room. Her clothes are still on the floor.“I still look for her on the street, in public places. Adidas trainers, long dark hair in a bun. I look but she’s just lost. You don’t know how you carry on living.”Teenager Natasha Ednan-Laperouse’s death should serve as a warning of how dangerous this practice is.The law states that when food is prepared onsite, ingredients labelling is not necessary. It is designed to protect small, independent stores. But our investigation today reveals large chains have not learnt from this avoidable tragedy.Pret a Manger was warned nine times about the dangers of sesame seed in its artisan baguettes and yet it continues to sell items without allergy warnings.Now Natasha’s mother Tanya has challenged the chain to lobby for a change in our labelling laws.And, hopefully, stop other parents having to suffer such a terrible loss.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mrs May declared: “I’m serious about it when I say No Deal is better than a bad deal.“It is very important that people realise I am not bluffing about this.“I believe that we can get a deal. I believe we can get a good deal and that’s what we are working for. But nobody should be in any doubt.”Mrs May is gearing up for her toughest Tory conference yet in Birmingham, with grassroots Leavers, Remainers and Cabinet members lined up against her plan.But with just 180 days until Brexit, she swore nobody would be allowed to rob her of that “historic moment”.The PM is fighting for her Chequers deal — that would tie the UK to EU rules for goods.And it could give Brussels the right to annexe Northern Ireland economically  rules change — as part of a backstop to protect a frictionless border with Ireland.In a thinly-veiled attack on “chuck Chequers cheerleader” Boris Johnson she accused many opponents of “playing politics” with Britain’s future.Sitting in her study at 10 Downing Street, she said: “It is absolutely crucial that we deliver on the vote of the British people.“They were given a choice, they chose and it’s our duty, it’s our job, to deliver. This is about voters being able to trust their politicians to deliver for them.“This isn’t about me or anyone else. It is about making sure that we’re really battling for Britain.”In a patriotic red, white and blue jacket by Paris designer Paule Ka — which can cost up to £1,345 — she brushed off BoJo’s rival plan.He wants a Canada-plus free trade agreement and plans to launch it at the Tories’ rally on Tuesday.And she appeared to rule out a  to Cabinet for BoJo once Brexit has been finalised.With a wry smile, Mrs May said: “Look, Boris is an entertaining figure. I’m sure it will be a lively event. But I’m focusing on what is important and ensuring that we are working in the national interest and delivering for the country.“Sometimes people ask me about Cabinet reshuffles.“But I have a Cabinet who want to see the right result for the UK, and that’s what we are taking forward.”Can she make it to March 29 without a second referendum?And can we bet the house on her Chequers deal being accepted?With a steely glare, she replied: “We WILL leave the European Union on March 29, 2019.“We had the people’s vote in June 2016. It was a referendum and people voted to leave the EU.“As it happens, I’m not really a betting woman, but what I would say is I’m confident that we can get a deal, and a good deal.“We are in the final straits of the negotiation. It was always going to be the toughest part and I think there is a genuine desire for a deal on both sides. There is still time.”Mrs May blasted Labour for shting its position on trade, free movement, and a second referendum despite promising to respect the original result.She said: “They break their promises and are playing politics with peoples’ lives. It’s more important to work in the national interest. The Chequers plan is the only one on the table at the moment that does all the things I’ve set out.“It protects jobs, brings an end to free moment, the jurisdiction of the European Court here, an end to vast payments to the EU every year and ensures we don’t have a hard border in Ireland.”Mrs May stressed that she is upbeat about Britain’s future outside the EU despite being a Remainer during the Referendum campaign.She insisted she wasn’t running a “damage limitation exercise” over Brexit. The PM said: “Yes, things will be dferent after Brexit.“We will be able to work with other countries on trade deals that bring jobs and prosperity to the UK.“It’s important that we set the UK at the forefront of key issues — AI and data, clean growth, the future of mobility, the ageing populations.“We are addressing those challenges and putting in place the building blocks that really take this country forward.”She added: “I genuinely believe there is a real opportunity for the UK post-Brexit and I feel it is an optimistic future.“This is a great country. We have great people and I think our best days are ahead of us.“But our future is in our hands. It is for us to grasp that. My message to people is that at this historic moment it is important for us to come together in the national interest.”Mrs May also insisted her stance against Russia over the Salisbury poisonings has been vindicated.The PM said: “It’s important not just that we stood up to it, but that many countries stood alongside us.”THE Cabinet has lots of bounce – because they are a team of Tiggers, boasts Theresa May.She admits that she often chuckles at her ministers’ quirks, and said their enthusiasm reminded her of the Winnie the Pooh character.Chancellor Philip Hammond’s downbeat Brexit predictions has led to him being likened to Pooh’s miserable donkey pal Eeyore. The PM retorted: “I think I’ve got a Cabinet of Tiggers.“Everybody is really keen on making sure we get a good deal from Europe and make the best of Brexit and make a real success of it.”CHILDREN who survived the Grenfell tragedy have been given pride of place in the PM’s study with a display of their artwork.Mrs May has kept some of the colourful creations they made during a visit to mark the first anniversary of the London tower block blaze which claimed 72 lives.She said: “We had some children from Grenfell and the surrounding area to an event we put on in the garden. Their finished work was so lovely, I’ve decided to keep it behind my desk.“It really does cheer me up.”The artwork includes a crown, stars in a jar, a mask and paper flowers.In the largest vote ever recorded in Britain, we chose to leave the Brussels racket.And as she reveals in our exclusive interview on these pages, Theresa May is determined to tell the world that we are getting out, no s, no buts.Tory Conference this week will be testy. There remain serious splits in the party over Brexit but on one thing they must be united: nothing can imperil our exit.But while the PM is right that a second referendum is for the birds, the country is constantly holding a referendum on her leadership.On domestic issues it is Labour that seems to have an answer to everything — even  those easy solutions rely on made-up money and would be disastrous in practice.Governments cannot just promise the world in airy-fairy speeches but, faced with an Opposition full of empty promises, the Tories must be radical. They cannot just deliver watered-down versions of whatever Jeremy Corbyn has cooked up.There are plenty of brains in the Tory party. Let’s hear their ideas and a real vision of what Britain can be.THE dreaded lurgy which plagued Mrs May’s last conference has struck again.With just three days to go before she makes her big speech in Birmingham, the PM is fighting off a stinking cold.She has been taking medication and will have some early nights to avoid a repeat of last year when she had a coughing fit during her keynote address.It was also marred by letters falling off the stage set and a comedian invading the platform to hand her a mock P45.Asked  she felt under the weather, Mrs May quipped: “It’s all the hard work of preparing for the interview with you, Dave.” The PM had just ed from a gruelling trip to the United Nations in New York.She snfled: “I’m not sure it is actually coming out as a proper cold.

If it was not for this pipe in the street I would die.”President Nicolas Maduro’s state-run water company is now so broke that reservoirs are empty, crumbling pipes flood neighbourhoods and the utility’s staff are quitting in droves.One report states that “institutional incompetence” has resulted in only 27 per cent ofThose that can afford it buy water on the black market instead.The Sun on Sunday went behind the curtain of the failed left-wing state to witness horrors that could be unleashed by the renationalising policies Corbyn spoke so passionately about at Labour conference.Delegates in Liverpool this week cheered as leaders unveiled plans to make great swathes of our industry state-run — including railways, utility firms and the postal service.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said he will force companies with more than 250 employees to hand over a ten per cent share of their firm to workers and the state.The idealistic aims are familiar to Venezuelans, who saw former leader Hugo Chavez do exactly the same after he was re-elected in 2006.He nationalised Electricidad de Caracas, the country’s biggest power producer, 11 years ago.State industries which face no competition end up overmanned, corrupt and lacking in innovation.In Venezuela, former leader Chavez nationalised the oil, telecom and banking sectors.Oil profits subsidised his welfare spending but corruption grew.Subsequent losses have been subsidised by government borrowing, and then hyperinflation resulted as they printed money to repay loans at home and abroad.There is now limited scope to raise cash for maintaining essentials . . . like water pipes.In the UK, organisations that were nationalised between 1945 and 1951 – including rail, coal, iron and steel industries – soon ran into dficulties.Speaking under the threat of arrest, Dr Del Valle says blackouts now blight ­Caracas’ Vargas Hospital.She said: “I have seen your Jeremy Corbyn talking on television about how much he admires our leaders.“He should come here and see what it is like for himself.“We had a power cut last week and had to spend all night using hand pumps to keep patients in intensive care alive as the ventilators had failed.“We lost one person. The next time it might be more.“This hospital has no medicine, no cleaning products, no working ambulances and the water out of our taps is brown and dirty.We have to ask the patients to bring in their own drinking water.“We do not have bin bags and the wards are filthy. We have not received any government funding since October.“I used to think our directors were stealing the money.Now I realise they do not have any to give us.”Dogs and cats are allowed to roam among sick and dying patients as the animals get rid of the rats that previously infested the hospital.We saw bloated, naked corpses on steel slabs turning yellow in the heat and malnourished children surviving on a portion of rice a day.Baby Isaias was one of many starving little ones. His mum Fanny, 40, said: “He has been sick for two months. He has diarrhoea and malnutrition. The hospital has nothing.”Railways, which Corbyn wants to renartionalise in Britain, are chaotic here in Caracas.Standing at the crowded station office worker Jesus Romero says he often queues for 40 minutes just to buy a ticket.But he feels lucky to get one — in May the state-owned firm that operates the trains ran out of money to print them.Jesus, 52, said: “The most critical issue is security.People are so hungry they will do anything to get food.“I have seen people getting robbed in the station and on the train.“Another problem is that often there is no air conditioning — I have seen people fainting in the heat.”Corruption haunts every aspect of le including the police force, which people view as less trustworthy than the criminals in a country where there are 60 murders a day.The situation has only got worse since steak-loving socialist Maduro took over on Chavez’s death in 2013.Maduro provoked the wrath of his starving people this month when he was filmed enjoying a lavish serving of his favourite food prepared by a celebrity chef in Turkey.Corbyn failed to mention Venezuela once in his conference speech.Maybe because, as Dr Del Valle told us: “If Jeremy Corbyn thinks this is a good way to run a country he must be completely insane.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

causing utter destruction on Friday.Rescue teams now face a race against time to free people trapped in the rubble of wrecked buildings and the authorities fear the death toll could reach the “thousands”.The tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi following a 7.5 scale earthquake under the ocean.Palu lies inside a narrow bay and experts believe the shape of the coast could have concentrated the impact of the wave.Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University, told National Geographic: “That can amply wave height as it channels water into a smaller area.”The quake that led to the tsunami could have been caused when sections of the earth’s crust grinded together.However, experts are sceptical whether this alone would cause such huge waves heading towards Palu.Scientists believe landslides, above or below water, may have also contributed to the scale of the tsunami.A tsunami can travel quicker than a jet liner – meaning communities along a coastline like Sulawesis can be wiped out before they can escape.Indonesia frequently suffers earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis due to its position on the ‘Ring of Fire’ – an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacic Basin.Many countries make up the Ring of Fire but Indonesia is seen to be the most vulnerable to natural disasters.In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island in western Indonesia triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000438179329.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"641\" width=\"960","title":"theresa may bbc interview andrew marr photobomb","story":"The PM was interviewed by the BBC’s Andrew Marr at the start of the Tory party conference in Birmingham.Mrs May was hoping to use the event to promote her plan for Brexit and send a message to Brussels that they need to be more flexible.But halfway through the interview, a man outside the studio started doing star jumps in an apparent bid to attract attention.He could also be seen talking on the phone to a friend -

The order of these pledges is interesting, reflecting Tory priorities which some in the party will claim are in the wrong order.They are, in this order::: The best Brexit deal for Britain:: A long-term plan for the NHS:: A strong economy:: Improving education:: Protecting the environment:: Tackling injustices:: Global Britain:: More homes.Is building more homes, really the party\u0027s lowest priority?As  managing Boris\u0027s bombshell this week wasn\u0027t bad enough, it was reported that Mr Lewis was planning to brandish his phone and sing the praises of the app during his speech welcoming the activists at the opening of the conference on Sunday. Not true, I\u0027m told emphatically. Probably just as well!The other Sunday highlights, during a session on Global Britain, will be speeches by the Brexiteer International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, another Brexiteer, the International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, followed by the new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.Amid all the speculation about how long Theresa May will survive as PM, Penny Mordaunt is seen by many as a potential candidate for the leadership from the Tory right. Jeremy Hunt\u0027s odds have also shortened dramatically since his fairly gaffe-free start as foreign secretary.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-tory-conference-2016_4438198.jpg?20180929221830 ","title":"whos auditioning for the conservative leadership in birmingham this week","story":":: Dominic Raab - The Brexit secretary is due to speak from the main conference stage on Monday and, other than that, he is only listed to appear at one fringe event.

Mr Davis walked out from his post because he disagreed with the Prime Minister\u0027s Chequers plan which would see the UK collect customs duties on behalf of the EU. But Mr Davis, who has been a Eurosceptic all his political le, has warned that Brexit talks will come down to the wire arguing that the EU thrived on pushing its opponents to the brink.  He told Sky\u0027s Sophy Ridge: We\u0027re going to have a very scary few months - from now until about November it\u0027s going to be really scary. Everybody\u0027s going to be calling each other\u0027s bluff, there\u0027s all sorts of brinkmanship going to go on - that\u0027s normal, that\u0027s the European Union\u0027s daily bread and that\u0027s what we\u0027ve got to be ready for.  I\u0027ve always said this to the Prime Minister the issue is always going to be the last month. It\u0027s not going to be the two years that run up to it because the European Union always uses time, always tries to pressurise you always takes you to what they call the clf edge and sees  you panic. Mr Davis, who resigned in July, suggested that fears of a hard border in Ireland were being overblown, describing the issue as an inconvenient exaggeration. He told Sky News that arrangements could be made to keep the border open, adding: Your viewers should ask themselves who do they believe on this? David Trimble in Northern Ireland - a Nobel Prize winner who put his le on the line to create the peace process - or  Barnier and  Juncker?  Trimble supports the arguments I have put about resolving the Irish border issue.  Asked  he would support a longer transition period to sort out the Irish border issue, Mr Davis said: We don\u0027t need one. We\u0027ve got 21 months coming anyway. That\u0027s way beyond what we need to do this. Most of these issues are manageable. The issue is not time, the issue is willingness to take on the problem. Mr Davis downplayed the likelihood the UK would crash out of the EU without a deal saying he was 80 - 90% sure there would be an agreement which would be some form of free trade arrangement.

They’re not, I think it’s fair to say, in great form. “It’s going to be mayhem,” he said. “God only knows what will happen. There are lots of angry people about. Think I’ll pack a crash helmet.” Much of the fury around the party at the moment is focused on PM Theresa May. The Conservatives ide themselves into two schools of thought – those who think she’ll be gone this year, and those who think it will be 2019. My glum Tory mate summed it up: “The only way she’d survive is with a f***ing time machine.” An interesting thought there...Theresa May as Doctor Who. She has a whole load of scary-looking \u0026shyenemies, better known as the Cabinet, where foes such as Michael Gove lurk. But where would she go with a time machine? And where did her problems start?  Maybe the most obvious answer would be to take her TARDIS back before David Cameron promised an EU referendum.  Perhaps she could have talked him out of it, since Brexit really has tied  her hands.  Maybe back to that walking holiday where the fateful decision to hold her disastrous general election was made. Or the evening she got Boris’s CV for the Foreign Secretary job. Or maybe all these things were \u0026shyinevitable and couldn’t be changed. The pressure to have an EU \u0026shyreferendum would have always been there, which begat the election, which begat a rampant Boris.  There was an interesting discussion at Labour Conference, admittedly quite late at night. It was during one of those conversations where you sort out who killed Kennedy*, the names of the 1992 AC Milan back four** and your all-time Top Five chocolate bars***. The theory put forward is that Mrs May never really wanted the job in the first place. That was probably wrong but the next theory was far closer to the truth: She did want the job, but now she doesn’t want it any more. She wants to walk away, and has wanted to for a while.

The Prime Minister was branded disgusting as she said sorry for victims\u0027 heartache - but would not take responsibility for the policy blamed for triggering the misery. She told the BBC: “The point of the policy was to ensure that those people who were in the United Kingdom illegally were identied and appropriate action was taken. What went wrong was that people from the Windrush generation who were here legally – had every right to be here, who had helped to build our great national institutions – found themselves unable to show that documentation and got caught up in that.” Cringing Mrs May\u0027s conference cough, which scuppered her speech in incredible scenes last year, ed briefly today during a round of morning TV interviews. On the Andrew Marr Show she was forced to watch footage of a woman who lost her job and was unable to work because she could not prove she was British.  Sarah Connor said: “Apologies are all good and well but an apology doesn\u0027t help the things the Windrush people have gone through.” Mrs May replied: I can only apologise for what Sarah went through and what her family have gone through. As Home Secretary Mrs May famously vowed to create a hostile environment for illegal immigrants. Critics say this led to a surge in members of the Windrush generation - Commonwealth-born migrants who came to Britain before 1973 - being wrongly told to produce documents or leave the country. All those who arrived before 1973 had the right to stay but the Home Office destroyed arrival documents, and many did not have the right paperwork.  At least 18 people were unlawfully detained or deported. But Mrs May today said the scandal covered successive governments, not just the Tories. Instead of apologising personally for the policy she said: The policy... the purpose of the policy... it was to ensure, and we maintain a compliant environment policy... the purpose of the policy is to ensure those people who are here illegally are identied and appropriate action is taken. I apologise for the fact that some people who should not have been caught up in that were caught up in that. With, in some cases, tragic results. The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

One top Tory told the Sunday : This could put people’s safety at risk – Brandon Lewis needs to get a grip. A former minister accused the party of “utter incompetence”.

Yesterday we got that app sorted as quickly as we possibly can. We\u0027ll get to the bottom of exactly how that happened and why it happened. Mr Lewis confirmed the Tories now plan to make a full report to the Information Commissioner, whose arsenal of penalties can include fines of up to 20million Euros. An ICO spokesman said last night: We will be making enquiries with the Conservative Party. Organisations have a legal duty to keep personal data safe and secure. Mr Lewis claimed the issue only affected a few people, despite the fact anyone with a publicly-available email address was affected, and the party was fully investigating. He also said the private firm behind the app, which supplied firms including Nissan, Barclays and Ebay, had apologised.  The flaw, revealed on Twitter by  columnist Dawn Foster, was part of an app that offers a guide to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, which starts tomorrow. Anyone who downloaded the app could log in to it as any registered attendee with their publicly-available email address, without requiring any password or security measures. Mischief makers could then see and edit other personal details for whoever they logged in as - be they MPs, journalists or other attendees. They could also share messages on the app\u0027s internal messaging system.

Laura said simply: “I saw things I couldn’t unsee.” Laura now lives in a “grotty” one-bed apartment in the city near Transylvania and works 15-hour days in a country where she does not speak the language. She split from her boyfriend before leaving the UK and quit an equestrian industry job. She said: “People probably think I’m mad but this is where my passion, future and calling is – we’re saving lives here. “Sadly, finding starving, stray dogs who are either barely surviving in freezing \u0026shytemperatures or practically boiling alive in extreme heat is the norm. “Some are pets abandoned after \u0026shybecoming too much work or money to take care of. Many have been abused, with gaping wounds or missing limbs. Some we find tied up or with limbs missing.” Each Romanian city has council-run shelters where government dog-catchers who patrol the streets take the strays.  But these are dubbed kill shelters by campaigners – as those which are unclaimed after 14 days are euthanised. Laura, from Lamport, Northants, said: “The conditions at public shelters are \u0026shyappalling. We do all we can to avoid strays being sent there. “They are captured using poles. It’s inhumane and the animals scream in fear. Once they’re caught, most are slaughtered anyway to make room for the vast numbers of other strays that must come through the system. There’s very little real care there.” Sadie’s Stray Dog Rescue can cope with 250 pups and kittens and tries to take as many as they can. Laura has been exposed to hundreds of horric cases. She saw a female dog who had just one leg, the other three had been chopped off. Another caught in a wire snare trap had a huge wound around her middle, while a third had a leg hanging by a thread after being hit by a car. It was amputated and the dog made a full recovery. Laura said: “One called Nora we found with her nose nearly sliced off, but with some \u0026shysurgery she made a full recovery and now has a wonderful home in the UK.”  But for some, such as a dog in the final stages of distemper, the rescuers are too late and the kindest action is to have the pooches put to sleep. Laura said: “What I used to think \u0026shyimportant seems a million miles away.” She used to travel around Europe and America with her showjumping boyfriend and earned a steady wage renting out stables. She said: “I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth but I had a fortunate le in the UK. I used to have nice holidays, go to events, parties and balls, with a social le which meant an awful lot. “Now, my le is unglamorous but so much more rewarding. I am on call 24/7 for emergency pick-ups. “Each of our dogs requires feeding and cleaning, so I’ll get stuck in to that, and make sure worming and tick medications are up to date. “I’ll update weight and vaccination records for dogs that are due to travel and post pictures for our social media channels.” The pups she rescues are checked by vets, vaccinated and travel to the UK with proper paperwork as approved by Britain’s government standards.  The non-profit organisation, named after an adopted dog which was killed in Romania before she could leave for her new home, was founded in 2014 by Lesley Ford, from Banbury, Oxon. With over 9,000 Facebook followers, Sadie’s has 12 volunteers in the UK and four on the frontline in Romania. The country has 65,000 stray dogs in the capital Bucharest alone. We previously reported how almost 1,200 illegally smuggled puppies were seized at UK borders over the past two years. Many of this number – thought to be just the tip of the iceberg – came from Eastern Europe. She said: “It breaks my heart when criminals ship tiny puppies for quick cash. They undermine Romania’s legitimate re-homing operations and all the passion and hard work that goes into them.” Two months ago Bucharest authorities banned the sale of dog and cats at pet shops in a bid to boost adoptions from animal shelters like Sadie’s. In 2008 Romania outlawed abandoning, hurting and unnecessarily killing animals. But Laura said: “Unfortunately due to the sheer numbers of dogs, official bodies can often justy the decision to slaughter, while evidence of cruelty is just re here – so the laws don’t seem to count for much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"madeleine mccanns dad gerry dreams","story":"NewsMadeleine McCann\u0027s dad Gerry dreams about hugging his daughter again - and is convinced she\u0027s still aliveGerry broke down and sobbed as he relived his worst fears that Madeleine - who vanished 11 years ago in Portugal - had been \"abused\"Share\u0026nbspByPatrick Hill21:46, 29 SEP 2018Updated11:50, 30 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/video/gerry-mccann-describes-horric-moment-13334687,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The father of missing Madeleine McCann wept as he insisted she is alive and told how he longs to hug her once again.  Gerry McCann spoke of his “painful” dreams about his daughter, who vanished in Portugal 11 years ago, just nine days short of her fourth birthday. Surgeon Gerry, 52, broke down and sobbed as he said he was “absolutely confident” she is alive – a view backed up by Scotland Yard’s plea for more funds to probe the mystery. He said: “It’s almost like an instinctive reaction... it’s just a feeling... but I do feel we will be reunited. “I just want to hug her and hold her and cry... a lot.”  Gerry also gave the most harrowing account yet of the pain he and we Kate, 52, have borne since Madeleine vanished from an Ocean Club apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. He told of Kate’s screams at the discovery and how the couple were plagued by “the darkest thoughts” of their eldest daughter being “abused”. Gerry recalled the numbing moment that reality dawned that their girl was gone. He said: “I remember just being in the bedroom – the two of us just completely distraught. It was almost feral, the reaction and the pain, feeling helpless, alone. “I couldn’t get the darkest thoughts out of our minds that somebody had taken her and abused her.” A series of police probes have failed to shed any light on Madeleine’s whereabouts. But Gerry, from Rothley, Leics, said: “I thought about it a lot early on and what I was absolutely confident about is whatever had happened Madeleine was still alive and is still alive.  “There’s never a day goes by I don’t think about Madeleine and what might have happened. I have dreamt about her, including in the last few months, but it’s not frequent. “They’re painful when they happen.” Gerry revealed his agony during a BBC Radio 4 programme about the bond between fathers and daughters. It was broadcast as the Home Office last night considered whether to grant new funds to continue the \u0026pound11.6million, seven-year British police investigation to find her. This week Scotland Yard formally applied to the Home Office for cash to extend Operation Grange for another six months and the move is expected to be rubber-stamped. Officers have investigated 60 people of interest and 560 lines of enquiry, but the last funding for the four-person Operation Grange team is due to run out today. The probe was launched in 2011 after the original Portuguese investigation was ruled “not fit for purpose”. Former Met Police counter-terorrism detective David Videcette backed new funding and said: “Good investigations take time.” Gerry spoke about how Madeleine’s siblings – Sean and Amelie, now 13 – helped him and Kate carry on.  He said: “The twins kept us going. Having two other children, trying to make sure they had enough love and attention that they deserved in their own right was incredibly important and thank God, I don’t know what it would have been like without them. “Thank God Sean and Amelie have had each other, but that they’ve missed out on having such a lovely big sister is very painful. Often my memories, happy memories, are of a girl who was almost four, but you look at Amelie and how she’s developed and you can’t help but think what would she look like. “Anniversaries are obviously really dficult and birthdays in particular, but also seeing Sean and Amelie going through all the stages I imagine Madeleine would.” Gerry choked back tears as he reminisced about cradling Madeleine in his arms, watching her go swimming and running around the garden before watching Dr Who. He went on: “The relationship I had with Madeleine was incredibly special. Between myself, Kate and Madeleine, it was like an equilateral triangle. “When Madeleine was very young she had really bad colic. She would get a lot of discomfort. I used to put her on my chest and rub her back and one of the things she used to do was pull the hairs on my chest really tightly. “It was quite painful and it seemed to ease her burden a little bit and I felt like I was taking some of it.  “I suppose all that contact time and skin-to-skin contact I did feel I had formed a really strong bond with her. “All parents think that their child is amazing and most children are, but some of the stuff I was able to do with Madeleine – the conversations she could have, her character, personality, it was really fantastic. “She really loved running around the garden and playing games and being chased and laughing. “And swimming, she loved swimming. You would take her to the leisure centre and she would just march out to her instructor with her cap on and goggles – smiling, no anxiety or fear. She was in there.” Gerry gave a gripping account of the moment he realised Madeleine vanished during their holiday in the Algarve. And he told of his immediate fear that she had been kidnapped by a paedophile. He said: “Kate came running back from the apartment screaming ‘Madeleine is missing, she’s gone’. I was like ‘She can’t be gone’. “I was looking in the bedroom, I was in cupboards, checking everywhere – even places where I knew she couldn’t be, under the kitchen sink.  “It was disbelief, shock, horror and then panic and terror. “I haven’t thought about those moments for a long time because, as you can imagine, it’s pretty painful. “I felt that every moment we couldn’t find her was worse and I remember being slumped on the floor and starting to call some of my family members and just saying ‘pray for her’ because I thought that was the only thing that might help at that point.” Gerry added: “There was an overwhelming feeling of helplessness that we couldn’t do anything and I think that experience we were feeling right at the centre of it was like a ripple or a tidal wave going out and crashing into all our family and friends as they found out what had happened. “That first night felt like it lasted forever. Obviously we didn’t sleep and went out again first thing as soon as it was light. Kate and I went out walking the streets of Praia da Luz shouting Madeleine’s name. I remember asking the police to get helicopters and heat seeking equipment and the thought somebody could be across the border into borderless Europe, driving her. Or Africa – the ports are a couple of hours away. I remember thinking ‘get the borders closed’. “It’s like the sickest you’ve ever been. It’s the worst of the adrenaline, fear, anxiety that manests itself in quite dramatic physical symptoms.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man rushes buy 25 bargain","story":"NewsMan rushes to buy £25 \u0027bargain\u0027 Argos leaf blower - but gets nasty shock when he opens itA tweet by author Charlotte Lo has gone viral with more than 26K likes after she revealed the unfortunate mistake her husband madeShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByGrace Witherden10:11, 30 SEP 2018Updated11:50, 30 SEP 2018NewsThe children\u0027s toy retails at £26.99\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bargain hunter who could not believe his luck when he spotted a \u0026pound25 leaf blower at Argos had a shock when he went to open it.

New versions of existing “more protein” ieties will be launched on the high street next January in a bid to tackle concerns about soaring obesity rates. Confectionery giant Mars Wrigley said the new Mars Protein will contain 17.5g of sugar, 40 per cent less than the current bars that help you “work, rest and play”. The Snickers Protein will contain 14.1g of sugar, which is 30 per cent less than the original. Each of the new kinds will also contain 10g of protein, around half that of both existing ones. Trade magazine The Grocer reported that the two new products will be followed later in 2019 by a new low-calorie range of “single-serve” bars.  These will contain less than 100kcal, around half of the original bars in some cases. The newly-merged firm said the range will include Mars, Snickers, Twix, Milky Way Crispy Rolls and Ripples.

Mandy Allwood, now 53, said Diana\u0027s hugs were a huge comfort as she struggled to cope with the heartbreak of losing all her little ones. The mum became famous around the world when she fell pregnant with octuplets in 1996 after undergoing fertility treatment, giving birth to six boys and two girls after only 24 weeks. But the youngsters, born over a period of three days and nights, did not survive and their mother was left devastated. Mandy received hate mail for going ahead with the birth of Kypros, Adam, Martyn, Cassius, Nelson, Donald, Kitali and Layne, before spiralling into depression and heavy drinking. And, on today\u0027s 22nd anniversary of their deaths, she revealed how Princess Diana got in touch with her five weeks after the tragedy by sending a lunch invite in the post.   Inside Diana and Charles\u0027 final tour before their separation - where they looked \u0027miserable\u0027 together  The pair then met several times in London hotels where the Royal offered her support, the Daily Star reported. Mandy said: She was absolutely lovely. “She gave me a hug, showed me lots of support and told me she liked my dress. “When we first met she said to me ‘thank you for keeping me off the front pages for a change’. It was a massive boost for me.  The pair met in October 1996 and again a month later - one year before Diana\u0027s death. Because of tight security, Mandy was unable to take photos or swap phone numbers. But she revealed Diana shared her own tales of struggling with depression. Mandy said: “We talked about her depression and my panic attacks and she told me she had been there too. We spoke about her family and she talked a lot about Charles and Camilla. “She was a very articulate and intelligent woman, and I miss her.”  The mum-of-four, now separated from the babies\u0027 father Paul Hudson, will lay flowers in south London\u0027s West Norwood Cemetery today in a silent tribute. She said: You will never forget your little boy or girl but you can\u0027t change it. You will always have those memories and you will come through it. Mandy had always longed for children with her partner Paul but suffered repeated miscarriages before taking fertility drugs to boost her chances of conceiving. And she became world-famous over her eight-baby pregnancy, appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show and front pages around the globe.

Now the very worst day of the Queen \u0027s le has been revealed - and it\u0027s completely heartbreaking.  She said that the IRA\u0027s attack on London in 1982 was the most ghastly day of my le, according to Andrew Parker Bowles, who has spoken out about the Queen\u0027s reaction for the first time. The events, which involved bombs going off in Hyde Park and Regent’s Park killed 11 soldiers and seven horses.  A nail bomb exploded from the boot of a car parked in Hyde Park, ripping through a troop of soldiers leaving Knightsbridge Barracks. Four men were killed and seven horses died or had to be put down because of their injuries. Two hours later, a second bomb exploded beneath the bandstand at Regents Park as the Royal Green Jackets entertained about 120 spectators. Seven of the 30 bandsmen were killed and the rest were wounded.   Brigadier Parker Bowles, 78, led the Household Cavalry that day, and told the Express : It was a nice, sunny day and suddenly one heard this explosion one heard all the time in Northern Ireland.  One of the barriers opened and someone said, \u0027They\u0027ve blown up the Guard’. So we ran down to where the smoke was rising.

Following a frosty start to the week, the mercury will jump well above the 14C average in some parts on Tuesday, and could hit 21C later in the week. And, with further warm spells forecast in October and November, Met Office forecast models show a 60 to 80 percent chance of a warmer-than-average three months until the end of December. If September to December is 1.5C above average it could make 2018 the hottest year on record in the UK. That would give 2018 a 9.8C annual temperature, 0.9C above normal, nudging 2014’s record 9.91C.   The unseasonal surge will be driven by an incoming El Nino - a warming of the Pacic which boosts temperatures in October and November around western Europe. It is also being put down to warmth from the continent, alongside tropical air driven across the Atlantic by jetstream winds. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “2018 could push towards one of the hottest years on record. It’s a hot year even though it saw the ‘Beast from the East’ cold late winter.” Meanwhile, parts of Britain could be hotter than Barcelona this week as cold, as the frosty weather is replaced by surging temperatures. Many people will wake up to frost on Monday morning following a chilly weekend across a swathe of the country.  But the Met Office says temperatures will rise again in the south on Tuesday as a sweltering 2018 continues. And that could rise again in the following days, with a high of 21C possible in southern England, potentially making London hotter than Barcelona where temperatures are currently a degree lower.  Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: By Tuesday we could see a high of 18 or 19C in the south and we could just about nudge 20C.  Further north, it\u0027s going to be quite a bit cooler than that but still in the mid-teens. Around 14 or 15C is possible which is slightly above average for the start of October.  The amount of sunshine we get will play a massive part in how warm it feels.   And he said temperatures could tick up further still as we head further into the week. He said: Wednesday and Thursday could be a little bit warmer with perhaps a greater chance of 21C in the south. The upsurge in temperatures follows a chilly weekend in much of the UK, with some parts seeing the mercury drop below zero overnight. Katesbridge in Northern Ireland experienced the coldest night, with a low of -3.6C. And today will see showers and strong winds lash Scotland, spreading into Northern Ireland, parts of Wales and the north of England.

There is just one catch - it contains human poo. The pill has been developed by researchers at the University of Auckland-based Liggins Institute, who are trialling it on overweight teenagers. The aim of the Gut Bugs Trial is to see  the poo of a fit, healthy person could alter the gut microbiome - bacteria that live inside and on the surface of our bodies, of an overweight person. This would in turn help them to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight.  Dr Justin O\u0027Sullivan, a molecular biologist at the university said: The basic idea behind our trial is that by introducing more kinds of gut bacteria to obese young people, it will enable their bodies to metabolise food better, potentially leading to weight loss and other health benefits, such as lowering type 2 diabetes risk.” Earlier studies have shown that putting the gut bugs from lean mice into overweight mice led to dramatic weight loss The trial is believed to be the first in the world to study gut microbiome transfer in young adults with obesity.  The pills were made by isolating the gut bacteria from the stools of healthy lean donors and putting them into capsules which were then taken by overweight teenagers. Half the participants in the trial were given the bacteria capsules and half received a placebo - the results of the trial will not be revealed until mid 2019. A new documentary, The Good Sh*t, set to air in New Zealand, will follow four young women who took part in a piot version of the trial.

Getting it wrong is how we grow up and learn to get it right. So when looking back at youthful misdeeds and misdemeanours it’s only fair to cut people a little slack. But when those mistakes are sex crimes, then the amount of slack that’s cut should be very, very small indeed. Dame Judi Dench touched on the issue this week when she was asked about her friend Kevin Spacey being replaced in films and TV shows in the wake of sex assault allegations. Spacey apologised for past behaviour but denied alleged assaults, some of which police are investigating.  Dame Judi said: “He is and was a most wonderful actor,” then asked  we would now “go back through history” to remove “anyone who has misbehaved in any way”. She has a point. We cannot just wipe all of Spacey’s work from the archive and pretend he never existed. But sexual assault is not just “misbehaving”, is it? It’s an offence, it’s a violation. It can damage a person’s mental health in a way that effectively destroys their le. Take TV legend Bill Cosby’s accusers. Only one of them, Andrea Constand, has seen justice. As the 81-year-old actor – described by the judge as a sexually violent predator – was carted off in handcuffs this week to begin a jail sentence of three to 10 years for assaulting her, I thought of the dozens of other women who bravely came forward to accuse him. Decades later they are still struggling to come to terms with being drugged and molested by a man we thought of as America’s dad, but who was actually the devil in disguise.  Because the time window for prosecuting him had passed, he never had to answer to any of them. Meanwhile, in any country you look at, only a small percentage of sex assaults ever get reported, a smaller percentage go to court and a tiny number result in convictions. To stand up in public and expose yourself to the hatred of someone who has already abused you, and the scorn of those who decided you were lying before you even opened your mouth, is a level of hell most of us will thankfully never know. So I salute the courage of psychology professor Dr Christine Blasey Ford who – despite admitting to being terried – told a US Senate hearing this week she believed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was going to rape her at a teenage house party in the 1980s. She claims the judge, Donald Trump’s conservative pick for the top US court, forced her on to a bed, tried to strip her, and covered her mouth to stop her screaming, leading her to fear suffocation. She was 15 at the time, he was 17. He says it never happened. Dr Ford earlier took a lie detector test, and passed. He has not taken one. Two other women have come forward to accuse Kavanaugh – one says he exposed his penis and shoved it in her face at a party. Another says he was present when she was gang raped at a party in the 1980s. He denies both offences.

The comet was first named after the spooky vegetable by scientists at NASA , after it flew past Earth on October 31, 2015.  Officially called the TB1456 asteroid, it came as close as 300,000 miles away from the planet back in 2015 - or 1.3 times the distance of the moon from Earth. It will be heading back this way on November 11, but is expected to be even further away and pass by at around 24 million miles away. This is about a quarter of the distance between the Earth and sun.  The asteroid has been described as a death comet, because it\u0027s believed to be a dead comet but also because of its unusual skull-like shape. First spotted by NASA\u0027s Infrared Telescope Facility  in Manua Kea, Hawaii, it\u0027s unnerving features were revealed on detailed radar images taken by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. In 2015, NASA said the comet was approximately 200ft  in diameter. At the time, Kelly Fast, IRTF program scientist at NASA, said: The IRTF data may indicate that the object might be a dead comet, but in the Arecibo images it appears to have donned a skull costume for its Halloween flyby.

It is hard to defend United manager Csaba Laszlo now and it would be no surprise  he is given his jotters after this most horric of days.It started when eventual hat-trick hero and former Tangerine Billy Mckay opened the scoring from close range on 11 minutes, knocking in a Josh Mullin cross.The only chink of light in the game came six minutes later as Pavol Safranko got on the end of Fraser Aird\u0026#8217s delivery to guide the ball past Scott Fox in the away net.From there United laboured and County took advantage. Scoring the most simple and avoidable goals \u0026#8211 often carbon copies of each other.The second came on 29 minutes after a Jamie Robson mistake played in Mullin to square for Mckay to knock in.On 41 minutes the same problems United had faced all game down their left-hand side were there for all to see as Sean Kelly inswinging free-kick went all the way through past Matej Rakovan in the home net. A horrible goal to concede with no communication evident and the defence at sixes and sevens.Soon after the restart the Staggies put the game to bed when Mullin and Mckay linked up again with the former this time tapping in from a yard out on 50 minutes.Mullin turned provider, once more, two minutes later laying Mckay\u0026#8217s hat-trick on a plate for him and the Northern Irishman gobbled it up from a matter of inches out.Csaba tried to change things for the Tangerines, but by this point the punters had seen enough and were leaving in their droves and calling for his head in the process, as he brought on Stewart Murdoch and Fraser Fyvie to try to change things on 56 minutes.And three minutes later Murdoch summed up the Terrors afternoon as he was shown a straight red for a stamp on Jamie Lindsay.It capped what was United\u0026#8217s worst performance in years as County saw out the rest of the game with little problem.

We just seem to be falling short just now and it’s not good enough.“There’s nothing else for it, it’s the same old cliched stuff – you’ve just go to keep fighting away.“You need to be ready to go on the training field, pushing yourself to the max every day.“We have to put in the hard yards and that’s the only way it will turn.“I know the fans and everyone at the club is frustrated, they’re obviously used to seeing better times than this, but there is still time to get our season going.“That’s the only positive – there’s another game in a few days’ time, a massive game against Hamilton and we’ve got to go and make sure we get a victory.“I know, it’s easy saying that and the punters will be sick to the back teeth of people saying ‘next week, next week’ but it’s the only thing for it.”Hamilton against Dundee has been a grudge match over the past few years and last season at New Douglas Park was one of the stand-out moments for the Dark Blues as they came from behind to win the game in the 97th-minute through A-Jay Leitch-Smith.Kerr added: “Last season at Hamilton was amazing, an incredible finish to the game and that again was a resilient performance full of character within the group.“It’s dficult being positive after Saturday’s defeat and having no points from the first six games but we have to go there, knowing how hard it is down there, it’s an absolute dogfight.“They got a great result last week but it’s a game of football, 90 minutes, and  we get ourselves on top we can win the game on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5badf0a726d59.jpg ","title":"coffee giant starbucks plans to open second drive thru in

Estate earlier this year, and has now submitted a proposal for another.If approved, the branch would occupy land on Afton Way, close to the city’s Morrisons store.Representatives for Morrisons, which owns the entire site at Afton Way, say the planned shop would match the “signicant” growth of drive-thru coffee shops across the country.It would also serve a iety of people from passing motorists on the A90 through to nearby residents.The new proposal,  approved by Dundee city planners, would also create new jobs, and contribute to ongoing regeneration efforts in the North East.In a statement, representatives for Morrisons said: “The proposed small-scale drive- thru unit will form a complementary addition to the existing Morrisons store.“It will also generate a number of job opportunities for local people.”The application also hints at further development to come at Afton Way.Initial talk of an expansion on the site began as early as January 2013 – with other potential developments in future including a pub.Diagrams included with the Starbucks proposals detail a new, more convenient entrance to the site from the southbound A90 Forfar Road.However, this is likely to form part of a separate planning application in due course.And Morrisons also had a plan to mody and expand its petrol station approved in October last year.Starbucks’ latest move to build on Dundee’s ring road

dundee united boss is the hardest job in scottish football","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere were some cursory glances around the Press room at the Falkirk Stadium after Dundee United’s 2-0 win on Saturday when boss Csaba Laszlo, almost out of nowhere, asserted the following.“The most dficult job in the Scottish Championship, or Scottish football at the moment, is to be the manager of Dundee United.”He qualied that statement by adding that it is also dficult for his players to pull on the black and tangerine but his remarks did pique the interests of those gathered.It wasn’t so much disagreement or astonishment that filled the room but more a sense of being taken aback by the brutal honesty of a man who has been under such pressure of late.He eased some of the weight on his shoulders with the result at Falkirk under what were strange circumstances – namely going up against predecessor Ray McKinnon in the opposite dugout for a side sitting bottom and pointless.And it was clear that, despite assertions by some that Csaba is daft or clueless, he was very aware of the ramications had he not got the right result.“We showed good team spirit under pressure, they handled it positively,” Csaba commented as he laid out his case to the gathered press.“Now we can close this chapter and look ahead to the next game which will be very dficult.“This is the third season where the fans have been disappointed to be in the second tier and we are talking about a very massive, strong and passionate club that wants to be in Premiership.“If something doesn’t go right immediately you have noise which is OK but we don’t want to hide behind anything.“We have this pressure and we have to accept.“We don’t want to spend one more year in the Championship – it’s not good.“The Dundee United fans don’t want to hear that from the board, the manager or anybody. They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together.

We’re currently experiencing operational dficulties due to a temporary driver shortage. This issue is being actively worked on and we are already seeing improvements.“To keep passengers up to date, the real time information boards within shelters are programmed to show any change to services. All the relevant authorities have been informed of this situation and are being updated regularly on our progress.“Once again, we apologise for this short-term reduction in service and want to reassure customers we’re working very hard to resolve this as quickly as we can to resume normal operations.”A spokesman for the Traffic Commissioner’s office, which deals with complaints relating to bus operators, said they were aware of the current issues in relation to the punctuality of Xplore Dundee services but could not comment on a pending case.Back in June, the Traffic Commissioner fined Xplore Dundee £8,700 after repeated complaints about late and early-running services throughout the city.A report was submitted by Bus Users Scotland about punctuality failings and the services cited included the 9, 10, 15, 17 and 23 buses.The financial penalty was imposed after the Traffic Commissioner opted not to pursue a further investigation into the issues.One bus user, who wished to remain anonymous, said he found himself waiting almost an hour for a bus to Charleston last week. He said: “Journeys are basically going missing as far as I can see.“I have a family member who works for Xplore and it seems drivers are going off sick and they can’t replace them.“Myself and other people have been waiting up to an hour for buses – it’s shocking.“It was only the other week that I was waiting on a bus to go to Charleston and all I was seeing on the electronic board was that it had been cancelled.“The company weren’t able to send another one on and I was having to wait, that really shouldn’t be happening.“As far as I am aware this has been going on for quite a few weeks now. There’s no signs of it getting any better but something needs to be done about it.“I was informed that the Traffic Commissioner was aware of it so hopefully they will take it seriously.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-woman-who-brings-the-biggest-stars-to-glasgow","story":"                          OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the world\u0027s biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"everyman-cinema-glasgow-opening-date-announced","story":"                          A new boutique cinema will be opening in the City Centre at the end of next month."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock-and-hamilton-jobs-to-go-as-powerleague-to-shut-two-sites","story":"                          WORKERS at two five-a-side football pitch complexes are facing the axe as Powerleague announced the closure of its west Scotland sites."},{"url":null,"title":"take-that-fans-left-disappointed-after-glasgow-ticket-fiasco","story":"                          Take That fans have been left disappointed after failing to get their hands on tickets for their greatest hits show."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-festive-old-firm-derby-date-confirmed","story":"                          THE final Rangers and Celtic clash of the year has been announced."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-tells-celtic-striker-leigh-griffiths-to-show-humility-with-his-celebrations","story":"                          Even as the goals start to come for Leigh Grfiths, there has still been a little rebuke from his manager."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-some-of-the-acts-coming-to-the-venue-over-the-next-year","story":"                          THE Eagles have announced they will  to the Hydro for their 2019 world tour."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-brogan-tears-as-friends-and-family-gather-in-glasgow-to-say-goodbye-to-celtic-legend","story":"                          THE funeral of Celtic legend Jim Brogan has taken place in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock-3-motherwell-1-comeback-kings-strike-again-as-curtis-main-lets-kilmarnock-off-the-hook","story":"                          COMEBACK kings Kilmarnock roared back from behind for the second week in a row as Greg Stewart\u0027 virtuoso display helped them turn over Motherwell at Rugby Park."},{"url":null,"title":"major-search-for-young-coatbridge-woman-who-vanished-from-her-family-home-distressed","story":"                          A MAJOR search has been launched for a young Coatbridge woman who has been dealing with personal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"young-man-24-whose-disappearance-is-out-of-character-could-be-in-glasgow","story":"                          POLICE searching for a young man whose disappearance a week ago has been described as \u0027out of character\u0027 believe he could be in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"major-retailer-signals-interest-in-new-retail-park-at-former-barrhead-nestle-site","story":"                          Developers of a former pet food factory in Barrhead have announced the first company who will set up shop as part of a \"state-of-the-art\" retail park."},{"url":null,"title":"this-morning-to-celebrate-30-years-with-birthday-party-live-in-glasgows-george-square","story":"                          DAYTIME favourite This Morning will celebrate 30 years on air with a birthday party in Glasgow\u0027s George Square."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"                          AN English couple have decided to raffle off their \u0026pound3 million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117769.jpg","title":"Blainie 9 defies the odds in charity race","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn 2016, Blainie White  was diagnosed with a form of Batten disease which affects just eight people in the UK.

parkhead","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen failed to secure back to back wins at Parkhead for the first time since 2004 as they lost 1-0 to Celtic.The Dons faced Celtic bidding to rack up another away win over the defending Premiership champions having triumphed 1-0 at Parkhead in the final game of last season.The pressure was on Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers following the defending champions worst start to a league campaign in 20 years.However the Hoops grabbed the three points courtesy of an improvised back-heeled goal from substitute Scott Sinclair in the second half.Aberdeen made two changes to the side which edged past Hibs 6-5 on penalties in a draining League Cup quarter-final clash at Easter Road on Tuesday evening.Striker Stevie May ed to the starting line up with Sam Cosgrove dropping to the bench.Northern International winger Niall McGinn also ed ahead of loan Derby County left-back Max Lowe.Celtic created the first opportunity in the second minute following a swt passing move that culminated in a  Mikael Lustig cut back to James Forrest but the Scotland cap\u0026#8217ss curling 15 yard shot flashed wide.The Dons threatened on the quarter hour mark when a corner kick swung in from the left was cleared as far as Gary Mackay-Steven at the edge of the box but the winger sliced his shot well wide.It was a cautious start from both sides who were showing mutual respect.Mackay-Steven was becoming increasingly influential on the left flank and burst down the wing in the 19th minute before crossing towards the far edge of the penalty area.McGinn raced in to meet Mackay-Steven\u0026#8217s delivery but  drilled a powerful 20 yard drive just wide.Moments later McGinn crossed into the box and it just agonisingly alluded the unmarked James Wilson eight yards in front of goal.Celtic were denied by the woodwork in the 25th minute when a curling effort from Odsonne Edouard from 25 yards beat ing keeper Joe Lewis only to crack off the far post.Aberdeen came close with a superb attack when Mackay-Steven drove at goal and stepped past two challenges inside the penalty box to open up a shooting opportunity.Keeper Craig Gordon somehow pushed it behind.From the resultant corner Andy Considine, who netted in the 1-0 win in May, rose to power in a header that beat Gordon but Leigh Grfiths was on the line to kick clear.In the 48th minute Dons keeper Lewis pushed a low drive from Callum McGregor wide for a corner.On loan Manchester United striker James Wilson fired in a superb 25 yard curling effort from the right only to be denied by Gordon\u0026#8217s ing save in the 52nd minute.Wilson was to come off on the hour mark to be replaced by Sam Cosgrove.Celtic went ahead in the 63rd minute when a ball from James Forrest into the box took a deflection that sent it spinning up into the box.Substitute Scott SINCLAIR used real improvisation and awareness to back-heel the ball into the net from six yards.It came at a time when Celtic were becoming increasingly frustrated and Aberdeen influential.In the 73rd minute Grfiths\u0026#8217 shot a free-kick wide of the defensive wall but keeper Lewis got down to block.The Dons should have equalized in the 75th minute when Mackay-Steven whipped in an intelligent free-kick towards the onrushing Mikey Devlin but with the goal beckoning the defender volleyed it wide.Deep into injury time Grfiths broke upfield and clearly pulled on the jersey of Devlin to gain an advantage. The referee waved play on and Grfiths raced upfield only to miss when chipping over the advancing Lewis.Aberdeen: Lewis, Logan, Shinnie, Considine, McKenna, Wilson, McGinn, Mackay-Steven, May, Devlin, Ball.Subs: Cosgrove , Lowe , Anderson Subs not used: Cerny, Forrester, Gleeson, Campbell.Celtic: Gordon, Hendry, Brown, Grfiths, Boyata, Ntcham, Edouard, Lustig, McGregor, Forrest, Tierney.Subs: Sinclair , Rogic , Morgan .Subs not used: Bain,  Gamboa,  Christie,  Mulumbu.Referee: Bobby Madden\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"boss has no worries over logan at celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen Dons boss Derek McInnes today insisted he has no concern about Shay Logan’s  to Parkhead.Defender Logan will today face Celtic for the first time since he was red carded following full-time of the Dons’ 1-0 win at Parkhead in the final game of last season.During his celebrations at the end of the Reds’ first league win at Parkhead since 2004, the 30-year-old clashed with Mikael Lustig and Dedryck Boyata before being shown the red by referee Craig Thomson.Right-back Logan was hit with a two-game suspension which the Dons failed to over-turn on appeal.Earlier this season, Logan alleged he was the subject of racist abuse from CelticMcInnes said: “Shay is not worried about it so I am not worried about it. Shay will be fine. He is quite unique in that he doesn’t let things bother him too much.“I felt what happened that day was all blown out of proportion and really unfair on Shay and he got a two-game suspension for that. We felt it was unfair at the time but we move on.”Logan missed the first three games of the domestic season as the two-game ban for the red card was added to a one-game suspension that had carried over from the previous season.The incident came four years after Logan was the victim of racial abuse by former Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev during a 2-1 loss in September 2014.Tonev, on loan from Aston Villa at the time, was hit with a seven-game ban by the SFA after being found guilty of the charge.Logan is set to start at Parkhead today as the Reds bid for back-to-back league victories at Celtic having secured that win at the end of last season.Meanwhile, McInnes has ruled out any move for former Manchester City and Aston Villa attacking midfielder Stephen Ireland.The 32-year-old had been strongly linked with Aberdeen in recent days. Although the transfer window has closed Ireland is available to sign for a club as he is a free agent having left Stoke City during the summer.He had trained with Bolton during the summer and was also a target for a number of German Bundesliga clubs.But McInnes insists there was never any chance of a swoop for the former Republic of Ireland international who has racked up more than 250 appearances in the English top flight.The Dons gaffer also insisted there will be no fresh additions to his squad before the winter transfer window opens on January 1.He said: “He  is a friend of Shay’s and it was really just a conversation with Shay.“There is nothing in that but it has grown arms and legs the last couple of days. I am happy with the squad and we need to get players back from injury as well“The squad is what it is and I am not looking to add to it. Hopefully we will get one or two back from injury over the next few weeks.“We have a few who are on the cusp of coming back and a few longer term.”McInnes has six players ruled out of today’s trip to Parkhead – Lewis Ferguson , Scott Wright , Frank Ross , Tommie Hoban , Mark Reynolds  and Greg Tansey .McInnes said: “Lewis is still out but will be back next week .“There are a couple of bumps and bruises from the other night at Hibs but nothing that will keep anybody out.“Niall McGinn’s groin has responded well. He had treatment with the physios and trained yesterday so will travel.“Frank Ross unfortunately had a wee reaction to training on Monday and travelling to the game. We will get his back looked at more closely.“Tommie Hoban got his operation on Wednesday. It is a three-month timescale so we are looking at December being a bit more active for him.“In terms of ing to play for Tommie it will be January.”On-loan Manchester United striker James Wilson, who recently ed from a hamstring problem, is set to start today for the third game in succession.McInnes said: “James surprised us all with being able to last so long “We had a plan of two 60 minutes and then see how he felt going into Celtic.“James showed real determination and played his part in helping to get the result.“I have been delighted with James.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sign our

Robertson Trust, the largest independent grant-making trust in Scotland, and a further £23,000 from People’s Health Trust, with cash raised by Health Lottery Scotland.The money will be used to help the charity increase its opening hours from five days to seven, now opening at the weekends.With the addition of Saturday and Sunday, it will allow six new peer support groups for people with autism

develop their own strengths and choices.”Triple As also won big at the recent Celebrate Aberdeen awards, after Mr Meek was awarded the hotly contested Staff Member of the Year Award.Mr Meek added: “I

I decided to do something similar – something nice and simple that didn’t cost anything.“I decided to put them around Cove .“It’s meant to brighten someone’s day or maybe someone who finds it can hand it to another friend.”Jessica and her younger sister Amber O’Brien worked their way around the area to distribute the cards.She said: “She’s always on hand with anything I need help with, whether it be my work or help with my son.“I wouldn’t have, or couldn’t have, done it  I didn’t have her help.”The pair started at Cove Harbour before making their way through Old Cove, the Altens Community Centre and finished at the GP surgery.Jessica also hopes it can help people who might “suffer in silence”.She said: “A lot of people suffer with anxiety and depression and there’s still a lot of stigma surrounding mental health.“There’s a lot of people out there suffering in silence and I hope they can help someone who finds them or even someone can pass it on to someone who might need to hear something positive.“I don’t think one card will fix everyone’s problems, but one card, especially for somebody going through a dficult time, could help them feel better for a bit.”The mother-of-one takes her inspiration from the positive quotes she sees on social media and tries to put those messages on the cards.“I’m all about a positive mind and positive thinking.“People who follow me on social media know I’m always posting quotes about reminding yourself that you are beautul and confident.”Since Jessica planted the messages around Cove, people have reacted positively on social media and she is considering continuing the project.“At first, I wasn’t sure I should share what I was doing – I didn’t want it to be about the publicity,” she said.“But after a while, people started finding the cards and asking what they were about.“My sister told me ‘You should let people know why you’re doing this’.“The other day I drove through Cove and I noticed that a few of them were already gone.“It makes me feel amazing to know that there’s people out there picking them up.“I’ve seen posts on social media that said they found a card and that it brightened their day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"city judges cherry pick top gardens","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen gardeners have proved they have flower power after their green-fingered efforts blossomed into victory at an awards ceremony.A range of gardens have been crowned as winners in their categories of the annual Aberdeen In Bloom competition.The contest highlights the work of residents and businesses for their contribution to the city’s floral displays – which this year made it to the finals of Britain in Bloom in the “city” category.The Britain in Bloom final will take place in Belfast on October 19, and follows on from Aberdeen’s success in the Beautul Scotland competition where Powis Residents’ Group, Aberdeen Inspired and Cove in Bloom all took home top awards.For Aberdeen in Bloom, now in its 43rd year, there were almost 100 entrants judged between July 16 and August 3.

It was wonderful to see.”Starting out with no budget, Heather had to rely on the kindness of the Banchory Scouts who allowed her use of their hut for two hours a week.Ever since then, Heather’s resilience has seen her tiny acorn dream transform into a great and mighty oak.Heather and her team, along with the 100-plus Forget-Me-Not volunteers provide more than 600 hours of care every week for people with dementia as they provide much-needed training courses for carers.And yet, incredibly, Forget-Me-Not Resource Centre is a completely free service.“Carers already have enough to worry about without the added pressure of money,” added Heather.“We are a stand-alone charity and therefore rely on funding from grants and through fund-raising mainly, but we also receive some support from Aberdeenshire Council.”Heather’s drive and motivation has resulted in Bennett House, which was funded by the late Sheila Ferres MBE in memory of her sister Amelia Bennett who had the disease. It provides both a safe haven and secure environment. It really does feel like home\u0026#8230 and therein lies the key to its success and popularity.“We usually find we meet people at their point of need.“We hold a Saturday coffee morning for the public and people who are caring for someone with dementia will usually come in then with their loved one to see what we are all about.“It’s a nice informal and relaxed way for future users to suss us out.”Indeed, Heather’s insight and softly, softly approach appears to be working wonders.Two pots of soup simmer gently as Jane the chef keeps a watchful eye on the apple sponge in the oven.Heather introduces me to octogenarian Donald MacDonald, who has been coming to Bennett House for the past four years. His we Francois likes to make marmalades and jam to raise funds for the centre.“Francois has often said le would not be like it is for both her and Donald without Forget-Me-Not,” said Heather.“Knowing carers have a positive experience, fuels my fire. After all, they each wear the same shoes.”In between running the centre, Heather is writing a book to charter the Forget-Me-Not story.So are there any more little acorn dreams on Heather’s horizon?“A respite facility nearer Aberdeen would be my dream come true.”If you would like to volunteer your time or donate money to Forget-Me-Not Resource Centre, call 01330 822655.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion football fans need to be treated with more respect","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOnce again, it would seem the fans are the last people who matter when it comes to the scheduling of a showpiece game in the Scottish football calendar.The timing of the Aberdeen v Rangers semi-final in the League Cup for noon on a Sunday is outrageous.Having the Hearts v Celtic semi on the same day at the same venue is even worse.When did we reach a stage in our beautul game where those who actually fork out the cash to go to the games matter not a jot?That is why the Evening Express has today joined forces with the Edinburgh Evening News to demand a fair deal for fans.Early kick-offs and games being moved is part and parcel of the way football is these days.

An organisation which has admitted inheriting a deal from the now-defunct SPL which means games featuring the Old Firm or that will attract more than 20,000 must be played at Hampden?One thing is for sure – this is not the “best solution” for the supporters.Fans from across the north-east and beyond will not want to miss Aberdeen’s first Hampden clash against the Gers since the Scottish Cup final of 2000.Given the performances of the two clubs in recent times, it’s one of those occasions where it really is dficult to predict a winner.It’s one of those must-attend games.But the fact is, playing the game at this time could give Rangers an advantage  Aberdeen fans rightly choose not to make the ridiculous journey.Yes, there will still be thousands of Aberdeen fans willing to make the journey to Glasgow for the club’s eighth lunchtime kick-off for a semi-final in 10 years and they should be applauded for their dedication and willingness to travel.It doesn’t mean those who don’t make the journey are no less of a supporter, but there is a higher chance of a better attendance and atmosphere  the game was at a reasonable hour.This is about more than just Aberdeen fans being inconvenienced. Hearts fans have equal right to be upset.Clearly Edinburgh is closer to Glasgow and the travel links between the country’s two biggest cities are good.

Why should a cup semi-final which is being played on a Sunday be scheduled for such an awkward time?It’s little wonder with bizarre decisions like this that across the streets of Scotland we see kids wearing replica jerseys of teams they have only seen on TV. What is the point in supporting a Scottish team  they are going to have such ridiculous hurdles put in front of them?They would be as well staying at home that Sunday and watching Crystal Palace v Arsenal and Manchester United v Everton on Sky Sports – and that’s without even taking into consideration the games from foreign shores that will be elsewhere on Sky and BT that day.The suggestion from Aberdeen to change the Premiership clash between Celtic and Hearts at Parkhead the following week from a league game to their semi-final makes sense. But perhaps that is the problem. Few things in Scottish football do make sense, be it the issuing or rescinding of red cards on the field to having the country’s four biggest clubs play in the same city on the same day, let alone at the same stadium. The mind boggles.It seems that as long as the teams and people from Glasgow are happy and treated well, then we should just sit back and be grateful to have them in our league. What nonsense. It’s our national game. National. It’s about time the football authorities started treating it that way.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"survey 99 on board for skate park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNearly 100% of respondents to a study have thrown their weight behind skate park plans.As part of a feasibility study, 99% of people said they would be happy for the skate park to be built in Banchory.The group behind the plans was given the green light in May to seek a lease for the land at Bellfield Park by the Marr Area Committee.Due to the nature of the land, Banchory Skatepark Group  would need to gain a lease from a sherf before starting to build.BSG was tasked with producing a feasibility study as part of the application to the sherf.Russ Crichton, chairman of the BSG, said: “The feasibility study covered many areas but of particular interest was the community consultation.“The consultation threw up a fantastic result and very supportive comments.“Overall there were 531 responses with 99.3% support to a new skate park in Banchory.“We are now completing the specication to issue out to Public Contracts Scotland to gather bids for the new skate park.“We are also continuing to develop the design and preparation for our planning application which will take place in the next few weeks.”The consultation asked respondents 17 questions about the skate park, covering topics from the local need for the development to the possibility of a fee being charged for use.If the fee were to be introduced, the report says, it may only be applicable at night, and will primarily be used to fund a “pay as you go” floodlight system.Respondents decided £3 per hour was a fair price to charge for the lighting.Almost three-quarters  of respondents said that floodlighting should be part of the facility.The cost of the project is estimated at £240,000, 25% of which will be matched by the Banchory Developers Fund.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"leitch reaping benefits of swapping glazing for football coaching","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNorth-east\u0026#8217s Jack Leitch believes a new job could be helping him find top form.The Blue Toon midfielder has swapped working as a glazier for football coaching.The 23-year-old was working fitting doors and windows but ed to coaching in dad Scott’s academy.Leitch’s new job has cut down on the travelling he has to do and he believes it will help him deliver his best form for Peterhead.He said: “I was working fitting windows and doors for 10 months and I have to be honest and say I hated it.“I turned to it because I had been coaching but I wasn’t getting enough hours so I needed something with more hours and I thought I would do something dferent.“But I’ve got more hours again coaching so I’m back at that.“I’m coaching in my dad’s academy across North Lanarkshire so it’s been really good.“I’ve been helping my dad out with some sessions and learning from him.“It’s a dferent way of coaching because when you are doing one-on-one stuff it is a lot more specic to meet players’ inidual needs, so it’s really interesting.“The company I was working for before was quite high profile and busy and there was a lot of travelling up and down to jobs.“And that was on top of playing for Peterhead and travelling up and down to Peterhead training and games.“It was a bit much for me so it’s good to be back to the coaching.“And I think it might be making a dference to my game as well because I felt really good on Saturday against Berwick.“It’s good to be in a football environment all the time and enjoyment is a big thing.”Balmoor boss Jim McInally also thinks the move is a good one for Leitch, allowing him more time to focus on his football with the Blue Toon.He added: “He travels enough by playing for us, but as a glazier he was travelling the  and breadth of the country.“Getting back into football coaching will take the pressure off him a bit.“And it will keep him out practising his football and it will improve his fitness.“He’s a fit boy anyway, but he’ll benefit from getting off a heavy job.“I always give part-time players total respect, not just my own players, but part-time players at every level – our league, the Highland League and below because they all make a great effort to play a game of football and get to training.”Meanwhile, Peterhead midfielder Aaron Norris has gone out on loan to Highland League Formartine United until January.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op.32 No.12 as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer?Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse/harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills 2,000 years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead \u0026#8211 now wasted \u0026#8211 would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year\u0026#8217s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall \u0026#8211 this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £700 at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers \u0026#8211 Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £915.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior/1st male \u0026#8211 Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: 1:10:40Female Senior/1st female –Lucy Fraser 1:15:05Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club 1:17:55Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club 1:10.19.42Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – 1:12:48Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club 1:23:34Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – 1:19:30Female Vintage  – Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club 1:38:22Male Super Vintage  – Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club 1:25:001st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend 1:19:441st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin 1:16:28The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of 1 hour 12 minutes and 56 seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage category  put in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage 70+ age group and won by over 20 minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the 12-mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage race  Alan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at 8 minutes and 9 seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the 40+ veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by 20 seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of 25 minutes 33 seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a 31 minute 7 second run being 10 seconds quicker then Phil Dye and 30 seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteran  female category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veteran  category saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of 1:16:28, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at 1:20:51 and Iain MacNicol in third place 1:23:56. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at 1:19:44, in second place was Sarah Grfin at 1:21:33 and Louise Gibson at 1:25:34 in third place.\u0026nbspTeam EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were 13 teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of 7 minutes 52 seconds, followed only 20 seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only 20 seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction 4.0, ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘40 Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.\u0026nbspThanks, and Feedback\u0026nbspMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

There was something for that Orange is the New Black fan, some Riverdale-style Serpent jackets spotted, and the 80s horror genre is still alive and well, ironically.This year\u0026#8217s convention featured a lot of zombies in costume and in the events. A panel of The Walking Dead stars was made up of Jayson Warner Smith, Lew Temple and Joshua Mikel to chat about the show as well as Aaron  and Ezekiel .In a panel made up of Walking Dead\u0026#8217s Khary Payton, Adventure Time\u0026#8217s Jeremy Shada, Animaniac\u0026#8217s Jess Harnell, The Last of Us\u0026#8217 Troy Baker, Uncharted\u0026#8217s Nolan North and Bravehheart\u0026#8217s Angus MacFadyen reading Braveheart\u0026#8217s script in whatever whacky toon voice they could muster.Gaming and Batman voice actor Troy Baker expressed a little-known talent when he came on stage with a guitar.And then there were the rows after rows of artists, writers, crafters, and whatever else you can think of. You want a cupcake that looks like Cookie Monster? An original graphic novel? A Spider-Man bathbomb? You\u0026#8217ll find it.The passion for the arts is the main draw though. Whether you\u0026#8217re taking the inspiration past comic cons and culture has given to make that perfect costume, a new novel, or a piece of memorabilia, the dedication and passion shines through as much as in Van Gogh\u0026#8217s Starry Night.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a busy time at tarbert golf club","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/09/18, 9:32 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt was a busy weekend at Glenralloch, home of Tarbert Golf Club, with several finals taking place and the rescheduled James Johnson Cup.Despite horrendous rainfall during the week the course was in excellent condition for the end of season James Johnson Cup.

This was an oversight because of demands on the service on the day.\u0026#8217Mrs Harvey added: \u0026#8216The council needs to know that people won\u0026#8217t take this kind of poor service lying down.\u0026#8217The tree was cut from the base by ACHA the day after the storm and later removed by Mr and Mrs Harvey\u0026#8217s family.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr dancing duo reach finals","story":"NewsAyr dancing duo reach finals of Strictly KidsJake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:17, 27 SEP 2018NewsYoungsters Jake and Olivia will take on the Cha-Cha for charity \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pair of dancing stars have knocked out hundreds of movers to earn a slot in the finals of Strictly Kids. Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

When a local authority starts “mandatory training” of its own councillors in bid to stop embarrassing leaks – you know right away that you’ve got a council with a lot to be embarrassed about! Yes, I know, it’s hard to believe that South Ayrshire Council could actually be embarrassed at all. After some of the strokes this lot have pulled, you couldn’t give them a red face with a blow torch. But it would be interesting to know how many other Scottish councils have called in professional legal tutors to train councillors on their own code of conduct. I don’t know the answer – but I’m guessing it’s another sensational ground-breaking first for go-ahead South Ayrshire! Just like turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, neither do councillors vote for anything that remotely resembles extra work. No, this one has come all the way from the very top where uncomfortable leaks insinuate a lack of total control. Of course, a lack of control can quickly lead to losing control. And “losing control” isn’t a phrase you want to use anywhere near South Ayshire’s chief executive, Eileen Howat.  Earlier this year, Ms Howat  reshuffled the SAC management pack – she discarded a few knaves and dealt herself all the aces.  Now, having sorted out the enemy within, she can focus on the only major threat to her imperious reign – that pesky Ayrshire Post and their constant supply of damaging leaks. The Post, as always, is independent and immovable. All that’s left for Ms Howat is to turn off the leaks at source – not just at any cost – but at all costs. And one of those costs will inevitably be the democratic process and the freedom of the press, or, in her own words: “the issue is information getting out before decisions are made by this council”. Hold on a second, I want to make sure I was reading that properly. “THE ISSUE IS INFORMATION GETTING OUR BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THIS COUNCIL.” Call me old fashioned, Ms Howat, but information getting out before a decision is taken is what local government in meant to be all about. In fact, its what any democratic government is about! And  I want to live in a place where information is withheld until a decision is made – I’ll move to North Korea! I know some councillors are still a little unsure of the concept – but they were elected to represent the public. Inform – consult – listen ... and then vote. To help the really thick ones, they put a little reminder on the wall of the council chambers. It says “Ne’e r forget the people”. Perhaps Ms Howat should ask for it to be changed – maybe “Ne’er inform the people” would be more appropriate for the style of local government she has in mind. I don’t know what SAC hope to achieve with all this – but sending councillors to “even walls have ears” class isn’t going to work. The leaks will carry on leaking and the Ayrshire Post will carry on printing them. It was the Duke of Wellington who famously said “Publish and be Damned”. If you look out your window, Ms Howat, you can see the square they named after him.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilNorth KoreaAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"progress made ayr golfing academy","story":"NewsProgress made on Ayr golfing academyThe latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park.

The latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park. Three holes were originally proposed. So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailable  there is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents.

This is simply not good enough and the SNP\u0026rsquos failure to deliver is holding Scottish businesses back and is unfair for consumers.\nThe report shows around a quarter of those in rural areas, such as the Borders, still cannot get speeds of 10mbps or more.\nThe European Union\u0026rsquos definition of superfast internet, which the Scottish Government has adopted, is 30mbps.\nBut local MSP Christine Grahame  said there were positives to highlight: \u0026ldquoBroadband access is in fact a matter reserved to the Tory UK Government, however  it hadn\u0026rsquot been for the intervention of the Scottish Government, the percentage of premises connected to fibre broadband in the Borders would be 39.3 per cent, rather than the current 91.4 per cent.\n\u0026ldquoThis report recognises that the roll out won\u0026rsquot be easy to deliver, but that is why this SNP Government has matched its ambition for broadband with \u0026pound600 million of investment \u0026ndash the biggest public investment ever made in a UK broadband project.\n\u0026ldquoI would highlight that the report also praises the Scottish Government for exceeding its target of 95 per cent fibre broadband coverage across Scotland by the end of 2017.\n\u0026ldquoAnd that, due to higher than expected take-up and lower than expected costs, the programme will in fact reach 60,300 more premises than planned \u0026ndash at no extra cost to the public sector.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos absolutely disgraceful that, despite being a reserved matter, the UK Government\u0026rsquos funding contribution to R100 is just three per cent of the total \u0026ndash perhaps Mr Lamont should focus on putting pressure on his colleagues in the Tory UK Government to step up to the plate and better support

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.  Mr Lindgren\u0026rsquos funeral at Musselburgh Congregational Church and Seafield Crematorium was well attended by the community of Musselburgh and Fisherrow.  Representatives from many organisations he was associated with, including Musselburgh Rotary Club, Musselburgh Air Cadets and Fisherrow Yacht Club, were present to pay their last respects."},{"url":null,"title":"plea-for-volunteers-to-join-the-team-at-musselburgh-cab","story":"  Claire Grehan, volunteer support officer, said sometimes there could be three or four volunteer advisers on duty but the busy High Street office was down to just one that day. The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

Joining Jackie on the dancefloor were Ali Wood , Alex Cunningham , Zoe Keddie-Dixon , Becky Everett , Callum Mark , Carol Fish , Joyce Lukkes-Presley  and Nicola Collin , along with seven professional dancers.  Each pair had a dferent dance style \u0026ndash such as the jive, pasodoble, samba, cha cha cha, Bollywood and Irish dance \u0026ndash to learn. After each couple had performed their routine, the audience voted for their three favourites.  Alex Cunningham and his partner Leigh Morrison, who performed a fast-paced Bollywood routine, which brought a touch of India to the Corn Exchange and Ali Wood, along with his partner Heather Antonelli, who did a salsa show dance to the soundtrack from The Greatest Showman, were announced as finalists alongside Jackie and Jane.  The audience then voted for a second time and chose Jackie and Jane and their high-kicking Irish dance as their winner.  Jackie, 46, who lives in Haddington with her husband and three sons, said she entered the competition after having a childhood desire to be in Pan\u0026rsquos People!  Her dance partner Jane is a mum-of-four from Dunbar. As well as working as a post lady for Royal Mail, she teaches Irish dancing at the Aine Hay Academy of Irish Dance. She devised and choreographed the winning dance routine to the song The Irish Rover.  This is the 11th year a Strictly-themed competition has been organised for charity by Bett Morrison, from Gford.  Tibor Poc and Hilary Mouat, the Scottish amateur ballroom and Latin American champions, performed two Latin American demonstration dances, with the Aine Hay Irish Academy and Dunbar School of Dance also entertaining.  Bett said: \u0026ldquoWhat a wonderful evening of dance and entertainment \u0026ndash such a iety of styles of dance.  \u0026ldquoWell done to everyone who took part and a special congratulations to the three couples who danced in the final \u0026ndash they were all amazing.  Former Scottish international rugby player Andy Irvine presented the winning couple with the Niall Fairgrieve Memorial Trophy, presented annually to the competition winners in memory of a much-missed local rugby player.  Mrs O\u0026rsquoKeefe added: \u0026ldquoWe are very grateful to them, to all their professional partners, the amazing Bett Morrison, to our special guest Andy Irvine, to all the volunteers who helped on the night, and all the many other people who were involved in making it such a huge success."},{"url":null,"title":"rebecca-is-my-driving-force-says-mum-of-inspirational-teen-after-taking-on-great-north-run","story":"  Pam Dalgleish was among thousands taking part in the Great North Run in Newcastle and Tyneside.

It hopes to transform the building, which has lain empty for six years, into a workspace offering \u0026ldquoinspiration and support to freelancers, commuters, remote workers, artists, businesses, social enterprises and community groups in and around the town.  The plan is a step closer after being awarded \u0026pound8,640 from the Scottish Land Fund.  Sustaining Dunbar claims the project could add \u0026pound800,000 a year to the local economy.  Osbert Lancaster, development officer, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThe building has been standing empty for some time.  \u0026ldquoUntil we know the full condition of the building and cost of remedial work and refurbishment, we don\u0026rsquot know  the project will be financially viable.

It aims to bring people together to create practical projects across the Dunbar and East Linton area that improve quality of le, support the local economy, and enhance the natural environment.  Mr Lancaster added: \u0026ldquoIf we can make it happen, it should be a win-win all round.  \u0026ldquoNot only will it be great for the people using the co-working centre, it will bring more people and more trade to High Street and boost the local economy.  \u0026ldquoA study we commissioned suggests it will add between \u0026pound600,000 and \u0026pound800,000 to the area each year.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now.

She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.  Speaking on Friday morning, the fourth year studying film at Edinburgh Napier University added: \u0026ldquoGenuinely, the reason I missed your call was I was about to go for a run.  \u0026ldquoThat would be my first since I finished the challenge.  \"I took a week off, I think I earned a week off but I am going to try to keep it up.  \u0026ldquoI expected to get fitter but did not really expect how much of an impact it would have on my mood.  \u0026ldquoJust genuinely you go for a run and there is no way you are going to feel bad afterwards.

Mrs Paul said: \"We have offered to fundraise with you and help manage the project and we\u0027d be delighted to do that.\"  Ms Cowie thanked them for their offer.

In the past seven years, Mrs O\u0026rsquoKeefe and her team have been responsible for securing \u0026pound4.5 million in grants from trust funds and donations from generous members of the public, as well as support from the Scottish Government.  This has enabled the charity to deliver more than 33,000 respite nights since setting up as an independent charity.  In 2017, Leuchie House supported people with more than 35 dferent conditions to benefit from short breaks with 24-hour care.  The North Berwick resident, who will be leaving in November, said: \u0026ldquoEveryone who knows me knows how passionate I am about Leuchie House and the very special service we provide.  \u0026ldquoIt was always going to be dficult to step down, but I know I can do so feeling proud of everything we\u0026rsquove achieved.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been honoured to experience on a daily basis just how much of a dference Leuchie makes to all the hundreds of families we support every year.  \u0026ldquoI would like to say a huge thank you to my team \u0026ndash staff and volunteers \u0026ndash for all their support and commitment.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.  But what was troubling them more was the \u0026ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.  The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.  But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.  They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death?  It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.  It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.  Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents? Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.  Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, for  it had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.  They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in 1603 which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.  It was written into statue by an act in 1609.  The Act called on all \u0026ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and \u0026ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .  And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.  When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.  It said there was a need to set an example to \u0026ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.  It continued: \u0026ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children \u0026ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.  The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be \u0026ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.  They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.  They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in 1624. They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living \u0026ldquoas  they were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be \u0026ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.  The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of 1609 was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other \u0026ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.  Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.  And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.  Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.  The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.  But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy/traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared \u0026ldquonon-settled lestyle.  But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.  They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didn\u0026rsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.  I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about \u0026lsquoTinks\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoGypos\u0026rsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.  The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not \u0026ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.  It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud \u0026ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.  It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the 1609 Act and made my spine shiver.  I didn\u0026rsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.  I\u0026rsquom ashamed about that \u0026ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"  The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

It follows a successful bid to attract volunteers to join the community project which is expected to take two years to complete.  Andrew Crummy, the artist behind the Great Tapestry of Scotland and Battle of Prestonpans Tapestry, spoke at a recent event in the Old Town Hall as did Melissa Viguier from the School of Ancient Crafts.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, which took place between Wallyford, Musselburgh and Dalkeith on September 10, 1547, has been described as the largest and bloodiest conflict ever fought on Scottish soil.  It began after the English king Henry VIII\u0026rsquos attempts to secure an alliance with Scotland through the marriage of his young son Edward to the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, failed.  Part of a conflict known as the Rough Wooing, it is considered to be the first modern battle in the British Isles and a catastrophic defeat for Scotland.  Now the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group is working with Mr Crummy to make sure the last pitched battle between Scottish and English armies, in which 10,000 were killed, is not forgotten.  The tapestry will be loosely based on the Marian Hangings stitched by Mary, Queen of Scots. Ms Viguier and a team of Edinburgh stitchers crafted a complete replica of the Marian hangings which can be seen at Edinburgh Castle.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh tapestry will take the form of a series of embroideries hung on velvet which, it is hoped, will find a permanent home at The Brunton in Musselburgh.  The Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group has already secured \u0026pound10,000 from the Musselburgh Common Good Fund, which will pay for the first phase of the tapestry. Chief stitcher Liz Neilson and her team will lead the work.

Mr Rylance said: \u0026ldquoYes.

Mr Pinter was a notable critic of the Iraq war, which he described as \u0026ldquoa bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of international law.

He published a collection, War, in 2003, which expressed his opposition to the Iraq conflict.  In his Nobel speech two years later, by which time he was struggling with cancer, he again lashed out at the case for the invasion, saying: \u0026ldquoPolitical language, as used by politicians, does not venture into any of this territory since the majority of politicians, on the evidence available to us, are interested not in truth but in power and in the maintenance of that power.  \u0026ldquoTo maintain that power it is essential that people remain in ignorance, that they live in ignorance of the truth, even the truth of their own lives.  \u0026ldquoWhat surrounds us therefore is a vast tapestry of lies, upon which we feed.

The visual scars of the Highland clearances he saw half a century ago, the ruins and abandoned townships, had a profound impact on Sir Tom personally and professionally, inspiring much of the work he has undertaken since. And the fruits of this labour have been brought together in a ground-breaking new book that not only adds to our knowledge and understanding of the clearances north of the Highland Line, but also sheds new light on how dispossession impacted on the rest of Scotland.  Indeed, the volume challenges the narrative many Scots have told themselves and others for centuries: we will surely never again be able to refer to the destructive events of the 18th and 19th centuries as the \u0026ldquoHighland clearances.  The name of the book, The Scottish Clearances: A History of the Dispossessed, 1600-1900, highlights Sir Tom\u0026rsquos central premise that what occurred was a deliberate and nationwide process that affected lowland areas as much, arguably more so, than the Highlands. At the heart of the narrative is an evidentially robust but also often grim and very human story of how Scotland was transformed from the rural society of old to the largely urban nation we know today. The end of traditional Highland le is here, warts and all, but crucially so too is the far less well-known story of the demise of an entire class of lowland folk, the cottars.  \u0026ldquoOne of my main arguments is that the scale of land loss was greater in lowland Scotland and that the scale of landlessness at the end of clearance was also greater, explains Sir Tom.  \u0026ldquoWe all know about urbanisation but in terms of Scottish culture, the sheer scale of the revolution is not recognised. In early 18th century Scotland most people living outside the towns and cities of the lowlands and Borders had access to some land because to be without it in that subsistence society was to court survival itself.  \u0026ldquoBy about 1820 in the lowlands and Borders, the landholding society that had existed since time immemorial, including the quarter to a third of old rural population who were cottars, had vanished.  As Sir Tom points out, while the wounds around clearance, dispossession and forced emigration remain painful in the Highlands, recognised and revered around the world, kept alive and passed on through families and communities, there has been no such process of grief or remembrance for the lowlands.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been interested in puzzles, he says. \u0026ldquoOne of the big questions is this: why in many parts of Scotland did the dog not bark in the night? With the exception of a levellers\u0026rsquo revolt in the 1720s the process in the rest of the country was silent. There is no folk memory of dispossession and that led many people to think nothing had happened, that the whole thing was concentrated on Gaeldom and the Highlands, where it is still a live issue.  \u0026ldquoThe clearances are something everybody thinks they know about. This book is an attempt \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquom glad to have been the historian to attempt it, because it\u0026rsquos been absolutely stimulating \u0026ndash to rewrite a central aspect of a nation\u0026rsquos history. It\u0026rsquos very unusual for a scholar to be able to do that, especially your own history.  Sir Tom believes English popular historian John Prebble, whose best-selling 1963 book The Highland Clearances is the sole source of many people\u0026rsquos knowledge of the subject, has much to answer for in terms of the mythmaking and politicisation that continues to surround this period of history. His new book tells a far more complex - but in many ways no less dramatic \u0026ndash story that covers improvement as well as loss.  \u0026ldquoPrebble and I share the same publisher and it was only while going through the Penguin archives that I discovered his book on the clearances is almost certainly the biggest selling on Scottish history of all time, says the Lanarkshire-born author and academic.  \u0026ldquoIn his terms the Scots are an ancient warrior race betrayed by their leadership class and pushed off their lands. That kind of human experience, that kind of story, is very attractive. It\u0026rsquos got a psychological impact that is dficult to dislodge.  \u0026ldquoBut the historian\u0026rsquos role is to be impartial and get as close to what happened and why it happened as possible. People interested in Scottish history in north America still see it through the prism of Prebble\u0026rsquos works. I quote in the book a fth-generation Scottish Texan lady who hired a genealogy firm to find out where she was from and discovered, like most 19th century immigrants, she came from lowland Scotland, in fact my own place of birth, Motherwell. She was not only displeased but for a time refused to pay them. She wanted Skye, and above all else she wanted a cleared township in Skye.  It will take time to wean north Americans off their overwhelmingly romantic view of Scottish history. But this is a book that is likely to ruffle feathers closer to home, too. Are we Scots ready to face and reassess our prejudices about the clearances?  \u0026ldquoYou get the sense that the Scottish nation is now a more confident and sophisticated place, says Sir Tom. \u0026ldquoPeople may be able to treat the arguments I put forward seriously, without indulging in outrage and invective against the author. I\u0026rsquove made the evidence base as armour-plated as I can because I know this is going to touch sensitivities, not least in Highland Scotland.  This latest 400-page tome joins the list of definitive \u0026ndash and also thoroughly entertaining \u0026ndash texts written by the historian over the last 40 years, a canon of modern Scottish history that covers rural society and urbanisation, the impact of Scots migrants across the globe, and Scotland\u0026rsquos role in the Empire and slavery, that is devoured and appreciated by academics and wider society alike at home and abroad.  We meet in a hotel in Glasgow\u0026rsquos George Square, a short hop from the City Chambers, where he has come from recording an interview for BBC Radio 4 on the city\u0026rsquos slave history. The 73-year-old is also a familiar face on television, his engaging, accessible style having made him a vital and popular source of information, anecdote and analysis for programmes on everything from land reform to Balmoral Castle.  Speaking of which, what does he make of popular TV history presenters such as Neil Oliver and Dan Snow? An eyebrow lowers and the hint of a wry smile appears across the Devine features.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not impressed with these people because they can\u0026rsquot be basing what they say on camera on deep knowledge and insight. They\u0026rsquore not scholars. There are plenty of telegenic young historians who could do the job very well indeed.  That\u0027s not to say Sir Tom isn\u0026rsquot rather worried about the future direction of his profession, detecting a \u0026ldquoserious weakness in the current generation of historians researching Scottish history post-1700.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be more risk taking in order to start to revise, or at least confront, some of the big issues. My generation is passing away, the next generation should be daring to question us.  \u0026ldquoScholars should be prepared to be in direct interrogation of other people\u0026rsquos work. My subject can only grow  people are prepared to challenge those who went before or are still writing. There\u0026rsquos not enough of that.  Sir Tom has spent much of his le challenging accepted historical narratives during an academic career that has spanned half a century at the universities of Edinburgh, Strathclyde \u0026ndash his alma mater - and Aberdeen. Earlier this year he was awarded the Letime Achievement Award in Historical Studies from the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on History and Archives at Westminster, the first historian from a Scottish institution to receive the award. In 2014 he was knighted.  Not bad for a boy from Motherwell who no one expected to be born at all, after his mother suffered a slew of miscarriages and his elder brother, Michael, died of spina bida two months after birth. According to family folklore his grandfather, an Irish migrant to Scotland like all his grandparents, spotted early promise in young Thomas.  \u0026ldquoFollowing my brother\u0026rsquos death, people didn\u0026rsquot think there would be any more wee Devines, says the historian, who lives in Hamilton. \u0026ldquoThen I came along and apparently one day raised my head from the cot \u0026ndash it must have been wind \u0026ndash and grandfather declared in his Irish brogue \u0026lsquolook at that boy already trying to sit up, he\u0026rsquos going to be a professor!\u0026rsquo In those days that was the acme of all achievement.  His childhood interest in history was initially sparked by military topics \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoat 12 I asked my parents for the memoirs of Field Marshall Montgomery \u0026ndash but he dropped the subject at secondary school in favour of geography.  He talks of the post-war period in which he grew up as a \u0026ldquogolden age in terms of social progress \u0026ndash he eventually swung his allegiance back to history as an undergraduate at Strathclyde university in the 1960s \u0026ndash and is troubled at statistics showing a stark reversal in social mobility.  Indeed, that is one of the reasons he believes vehemently that free undergraduate university tuition should continue to be offered to all young people.  \u0026ldquoIt makes Scotland distinctive and gives the impression that the democratic instinct is still alive \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos very important, he says. \u0026ldquoWhen I went through university we got subsistence and travel allowances, too. I simply cannot countenance behaving in a dferent way with the current generation. They are living in a very dficult world. We, the baby boomers, owe them.  Indeed, when I ask whether he is optimistic about the future, he shakes his head sadly, while conceding he has always been a \u0026ldquoglass half empty man. But this pessimism is clearly down to circumstance as well as personality.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that someone like Trump could be elected by the most powerful nation on earth is a fearsome metaphor. Then you go to Westminster and find the most maladroit UK government since the mid-19th century.  Then there\u0026rsquos Brexit. At the very mention of it he grows agitated. We both laugh out loud, however, at the absurdity of my asking what he thinks will happen in the coming months.  \u0026ldquoThe future is not my period, he answers. \u0026ldquoBut two months after the Brexit vote I said it wouldn\u0026rsquot happen. And I think the chances of it not happening are now greater than ever. I\u0026rsquom not saying it\u0026rsquos more than 50 per cent but there are possibilities. It will be a disaster for Scotland \u0026ndash indeed for the UK \u0026ndash  we have to leave without a consensual agreement.  The possible ramications for Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional position are not lost on the scholar, who wrote widely about and voted in favour of independence in the 2014 referendum. He has not changed his mind.  \u0026ldquoThe irony,  Brexit did happen, especially with no agreement, is that it would be a vital force in making for a new vote for independence. If [no deal] didn\u0026rsquot happen, it would be much more dficult to mount a challenge to the union.  And does he have any words of counsel for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as pressure mounts from more eager elements of her party and the pro-independence movement for another referendum as soon as possible?  \u0026ldquoIf one could suggest advice to someone with so much responsibility, I\u0026rsquod say keep the powder dry until the situation with Brexit is known and make extensive preparations in private or a secluded way to prepare for a possible referendum, he says. \u0026ldquoWe saw that in some ways with [former MSP Andrew Wilson\u0026rsquos] intellectually honest growth report.  \u0026ldquoBut  there is an attempt down this route over five, 10, 15 years and it failed, there won\u0026rsquot be another one for a very long time. There\u0026rsquos a much higher threshold of risk for the second attempt.  \u0026ldquoI feel it is impossible to have a consensus on this in Scotland \u0026ndash  there is a vote in favour of independence there will always be a very considerable bloc of people who are pro-union and cannot be shted.  Will he see independence in his letime? \u0026ldquoNo, I don\u0026rsquot think so.  So what\u0026rsquos next on the agenda, other than enjoying time with his we of 48 years, Catherine, their four children and eight grandchildren?  \u0026ldquoI want to write something, but I\u0026rsquom not sure what it is. I could be a spent force. I\u0026rsquove been writing about history for 48 years and, as someone once said about a iety of things \u0026lsquothat is not sustainable\u0026rsquo.  He lets out a mischievous laugh and one gets the impression he already has something up his sleeve. We\u0026rsquoll see. No matter what he does, I can\u0026rsquot help thinking his grandad would be very proud.  The Scottish Clearances: A History of the Dispossessed, 1600-1900 is published on October 2, priced \u0026pound25 in hardback by Allen Lane.  Sir Tom Devine will launch the book at an event in St Cecilia\u0026rsquos Hall, Edinburgh, at 6pm on October 06."},{"url":null,"title":"heres-johnny-the-horror-films-coming-to-a-classroom-near-you","story":"  But now scary films such as The Shining, Psycho and The Sixth Sense are coming out of the shadows and into the classroom.  Pupils enrolled in Higher English are increasingly choosing to study horror films instead of more traditional literary texts.  The Scottish Qualications Authority  said classic literature such as Shakespearean plays were still by far the most common choice alongside works by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.  But the SQA said: \u0026ldquoAn increased number of candidates chose to write their essay on a media text.  \u0026ldquoIn this genre, popular choices were the films The Dressmaker, The Shining, The Sixth Sense, Psycho, The Prestige, Shutter Island and Pleasantville.  The wider trend towards films is also apparent in National 5 English qualications, with ten per cent of pupils choosing films including The Dark Knight and Psycho.  Author Raymond Soltysek, a former teacher and co-ordinator of the Scottish Association for the Teaching of English, believes the trend is a positive one in a world where most communication is delivered through some form of visual medium.  And he argues that studying a film rather than a book is just as complex and rewarding.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are saying to pupils that what they have before them is a text and the fact they are watching it rather than reading it is really immaterial.  \u0026ldquoPupils still have to use a whole range of literacy skills to understand and interpret it so, just as in a printed text, they would have to look at metaphor and simile, characterisation and setting.  \u0026ldquoGiven the vast majority of people in western society now get their messages in some kind of visual form it is really important that we recognise that.  Mr Soltysek said the use of films in Higher English, which was established more than 20 years ago, would grow, but it would never replace literature. And he dismissed suggestions it was an \u0026ldquoeasy option.  \u0026ldquoThe core of an English teachers work will always be literature, but I have alway avoided film because it has been too hard for me to do.  \u0026ldquoIt requires an awful lot of technical knowledge of filmmaking skills that I find dficult. I would much rather teach Shakespeare than a film to any level of pupil.  Dr David Sorfa, a senior lecturer in film studies at Glasgow University, said films and the moving image more widely deserved their place alongside classic literature.  He said: \u0026ldquoEven great Shakespeare lovers basically know his works from film and television.  \u0026ldquoThey may have half red Hamlet when they were forced to at school or university, but, like Shakespeare, a lot of our knowledge about history, literature and the world comes from cinema and television.  \u0026ldquoThe sense that film or even television is in some way a lesser art form or something that isn\u0026rsquot as interesting is wrong because it opens up the world of literature which can be very closed to young people.  Dr Catriona Miller, senior lecturer in media policy, history and theory of film at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the horror genre had always been associated with teenagers as far back as Gothic literature.  She argues such films serve an important purpose because they help teenagers decode who they are.  She said: \u0026ldquoTeenagers are dealing with an emerging sense of self in terms of who they are and who do they want to be and, at the same time, they are having to negotiate who they are inside and what do they want to show the world.  \u0026ldquoThat is tough and scary to deal with and the horror genre deals with a lot of these questions in a very direct way, but with the added safety net that it is not real.  \u0026ldquoYou can risk staring the monster in the face and how to deal with it because it is not a real thing.  Ms Miller does not believe films like The Shining, which is rated 18, are too scary for teenagers, arguing they crave a real fright rather than one which is \u0026ldquodesigned for them.  \u0026ldquoSome of the films that are made specically for teenagers are not actually scary enough. They have to feel a real sense of jeopardy.  Filmmaker and critic Mark Cousins also welcomed the greater use of horror films.  He told the Times Educational Supplement Scotland: \u0026ldquoThese are works of art which allow pupils to engage with deep questions of fear and identication. It\u0026rsquos snobbery to suggest that great horror cinema shouldn\u0026rsquot be used in teaching."},{"url":null,"title":"kezia-dugdale-gets-new-help-to-defend-wings-legal-case","story":"  The former Scottish leader is being aided by the Daily Record as she defends a \u0026pound25,000 defamation suit brought by Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland website.  In a Record column last year, Ms Dugdale accused Mr Campbell of making a homophobic remark about gay Tory MP David Mundell - something Mr Campbell vigorously denies.  The development comes amid growing ision in Scottish Labour over the party\u0026rsquos decision to end funding to Ms Dugdale, and criticism of current leader Richard Leonard.  Many in the party are appalled at Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos apparent failure to stand up to Labour HQ on Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos behalf.  One source said: \u0026ldquoPeople are starting to wonder  he\u0026rsquos spineless or powerless. It\u0026rsquos probably a bit of both. He could pick up the phone to Jeremy Corbyn at any time, but he seems to think he won\u0026rsquot be listened to.  Clare Lally-Steel, Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos Carer\u0026rsquos Champion under leader Johann Lamont, publicly announced on Friday that she was leaving the party over Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos treatment.  She tweeted: \u0026ldquoThis makes me weep!! I am appalled that the Labour Party have treated her like this after everything she has done \u0026amp continues to do. This was the final nail for me, I will be cancelling my membership.  But the pro-Corbyn Campaign for Socialism said it supported the withdrawal of funding.  \u0026ldquoThe use of vast amounts of money to fight a court case that was triggered by an MSP in their own private column is neither prudent nor fair, it said in a statement.  After Mr Campbell, 50, launched a defamation action at Edinburgh Sherf Court, the Record initially offered to support Ms Dugdale, but Labour took over the case.  Ms Dugdale says then general secretary Iain McNicol agreed all her costs would be met.  However earlier this month, with the legal bill approaching \u0026pound100,000, new general secretary Jennie Formby pulled the plug.  It left Ms Dugdale facing large fees to carry on, as well as potentially ruinous costs for Mr Campbell\u0026rsquos damages and expenses.  It is understood the Record\u0026rsquos support for Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos defence is step-by-step, starting with an appeal against a recent sherf\u0026rsquos decision to hold an evidential hearing, and does not cover damages and expenses  she loses.  Ms Dugdale, a Lothians list MSP since 2011, this week said she felt \u0026ldquocrushed and suffered one of her \u0026ldquolowest personal moments when she heard Labour had ended its support.  She said she feared she would be made bankrupt and be disqualied as an MSP.  She also revealed she had texted Mr Corbyn about the matter, but he had not replied.  Ms Dugdale opposed Mr Corbyn becoming UK Labour leader, and her supporters suspect the end of the party\u0026rsquos legal support is connected to her lack of support for Mr Corbyn.  Amid accusations of a \u0026ldquobetrayal, and facing calls to reverse the decision in a high-profile vote at the party conference in Liverpool, Labour bosses this week agreed to reconsider the decision, referring it to the National and Scottish executive committees.  However this is likely to take several weeks.  Labour defended its action, and said party funds were better spent on campaigning,  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoKezia Dugdale has received signicant support from the Labour Party. The Party has a responsibility to all our members and that must mean spending our members\u0026rsquo fees responsibly and appropriately.  \u0026ldquoWe have to present and campaign around our message of hope and the need to Rebuild Britain and that is where we believe our members wish to see their fees spent."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-is-jeopardising-the-tories-reputation-as-the-party-of-economic-competence","story":"  The snapshot of entrepreneurs and executives revealed that just 26 per cent felt the party was \"pursuing business-friendly policies\" while 57 per cent disagreed.  Two-thirds said they regarded the Conservatives as traditionally pursuing policies that \"increase prosperity and help well-run businesses\".  The survey of more than 1,000 people carried out for the People\u0027s Vote, which wants a second Brexit referendum, found that even those whose businesses did no export trade with the EU were split 50-50 in terms of Leave versus Remain.  Among those whose turnover was more than 10 per cent derived from EU exports, it rose to 70-30 in favour of Remain.  Overall the split was 59-41 for Remain, with a similar split, 57-43, supporting a new referendum once \"don\u0027t knows\" were removed.  Mr Grieve, the former Attorney General and pro-Remain MP who backs another vote, said: \"This poll highlights the extent that the Conservative Party is jeopardising its reputation for economic competence with the business community as a result of the way Brexit has unfolded.  \"This should be a wake-up call because our party is risking everything for which we have always stood.

Any action putting an end to this atrocious misuse of public funds should be welcomed. Maybe they were finally listening.  Unfortunately, that is far from what\u0026rsquos happened here.  The name should be the first warning human rights reputational risk management. This is not about assessing human rights, it\u0026rsquos about assessing the potential damage to the funder\u0026rsquos reputation by association with those whose human rights records are abysmal.  That being said, even  the aim is not so noble, new guidance could still have a positive effect.  This isn\u0026rsquot really new guidance or a Scottish Government production either though. It is mostly links to work by other bodies \u0026ndash the United Nations, the Institute for Human Rights and Business, the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark Initiative and others.  Make no mistake, these are certainly useful resources, but by doing little more than signposting to external initiatives it is not clear what exactly the government is asking of its agencies providing these handouts. It\u0026rsquos impossible to avoid a feeling of this being no more than lip-service to dampen the bad press they\u0026rsquove received weekly as a result of our work.  Along with its reliance on links to other bodies, the wording of the guidance itself indicates that it is not compulsory. In its few pages, it only sets out recommendations and describes its own content as advice.  The language itself is not definitive. It suggests what kind of assessments should be conducted, but also states that the detail of what is checked is ultimately a matter of judgement by whomever has initiated the relationship. Due regard for human rights seems to rely more on agencies deciding themselves to follow the external links provided than on any clear instructions from the Scottish Government.  I\u0026rsquove asked the government to explain exactly what status this guidance has and provide copies of any human rights assessments recently carried out, to give us a clearer picture of what\u0026rsquos going on. Given the lack of transparency we\u0026rsquove faced so far, going as far as an Information Commissioner ruling that they breached Freedom of Information law, I expect this will take months yet again.

He also described her criticism of Labour\u0026rsquos decision to stop paying her legal bills as \u0026ldquoincredible and \u0026ldquoirresponsible.  Dugdale, who led the party for two years, is being sued for defamation by Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland blog.  Labour at a UK level had originally agreed to pay her legal fees, but Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos solicitor was informed recently that the party had changed its mind.  The decision caused widespread anger as Scottish Labour members believed Ms Dugdale has been abandoned half-way through the case.  In an interview last week, Ms Dugdale said: \u0026ldquoThe Labour Party made a promise and it\u0026rsquos not a good look for any political party to fail to keep its promise.  \u0026ldquoThis is what it\u0026rsquos doing to one of its own, so how can people trust that party in any other aspect of le,  this is what\u0026rsquos happening?  But Mr Rafferty, who is the most senior figure in Unite north of the border, said the Lothians MSP could have contributed to the pot with her own cash.

She topped up her MSP salary with a pre-tax fee of \u0026pound70,000, some of which she gave to charity.  Mr Rafferty said: \u0026ldquoSome of the comments she has been making are irresponsible, basically saying \u0026lsquoI am not getting the backing in this legal case, and so the party itself cannot be trusted\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoSome party members will be wondering whether this is the same Kezia Dugdale who was in the Australian jungle not that long ago and got \u0026pound70,000 for it.

Mr Rafferty also said: \u0026ldquoI just think the way that Kezia has attacked the Labour party, her own party, is incredible.

However, a Freedom of Information request made by this paper has revealed that only a handful of councils immediately complied with the legislation while a number are still not complying and have no intention of doing so.  Argyll \u0026amp Bute Council, which has so far paid out a total of \u0026pound4.8m to settle claims, has not included pensions in any of its pay outs and does not plan to factor them in when dealing with the 120 outstanding claims against it. Similarly, East Ayrshire, which has paid out \u0026pound862,000 in settlements since April 2015, and East Renfrewshire, which has paid out \u0026pound511,000 in that time, have also failed to rerate the pensions of the affected women.  Fe Council, on the other hand, which paid out \u0026pound11.3m in non-pensionable settlements immediately after the legislation was updated, has included pensions in the \u0026pound36.2m it has paid out since. Fe will also factor in pensions as part of settling the 1,100 outstanding claims against it.  East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Highland, West Dunbartonshire and West Lothian have also included pensions in recent settlements and will do so for future ones.  The overall result of the dferent approaches is that some women face being discriminated against for the rest of their lives because of the part of the country they lived and worked in, yet no public body will claim responsibility for ensuring the law is enforced.  The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, for example, said that while inidual councils are aware of the pension regulations, \u0026ldquoit is for each employer to consider the appropriate method of settlement and agree the same with the claimants and their representatives.  Audit Scotland, meanwhile, which audits the SPPA, all 32 local authorities and the 11 pension funds that make up the Local Government Pension Scheme, admitted that it did not consider pensions as part of its 2017 report Equal Pay in Scottish Councils. It has also not included the pensions issue in any of the reports it has issued following the annual audit of each inidual authority.  Noting that there are \u0026ldquohighly complex issues around the implementation of equal pay, a spokesman for the body said it is up to local authorities to \u0026ldquoagree the pensionable elements with claimants as part of any settlement.  Even the SPPA, which forced North Lanarkshire Council to include pensions in its settlements after being asked to intervene in 2016, said it has \u0026ldquono powers under pensions legislation to ensure compliance.  \u0026ldquoCouncils are independent bodies of the Scottish Government so negotiations entered into to settle equal-pay claims are a matter for them, an SPPA spokeswoman said. \u0026ldquoIf dferent agreements have been reached it\u0026rsquos for the councils to have ensured they are appropriate and compliant.  Stefan Cross QC of Action4Equality Scotland, who led the case against North Lanarkshire, said this shows that public bodies are \u0026ldquopassing the buck on the issue and failing to uphold the rights of the women the pensions legislation is designed to protect.  \u0026ldquoThe women are left dangling because none of the authorities will take responsibility for upholding the law, he said.  Peter Hunter of the trade union Unison agreed and said that as some women have been receiving the incorrect pension for over a decade, while others have died without ever receiving what they were entitled to, the Scottish Government should intervene.  \u0026ldquoPay is pensionable and therefore equal-pay settlements are pensionable. All this is crystal clear in the law, rulings and guidance on pensions so non-payment of pension contributions for low-paid women is yet another example,  one were needed, of the fact that public bodies need to wake up, he said.  \u0026ldquoMany councils still don\u0026rsquot pay equally, pension fund administrators are inactive in the face of missing millions and auditors still can\u0026rsquot grasp the cost and risk of systemic inequality.  \u0026ldquoThis is a complete system failure. Government has the power to act and the time for action is long overdue.  Despite this, a Scottish Government spokesman, who did not answer questions relating specically to pensions, reiterated the SPPA\u0026rsquos viewpoint that local as opposed to central government should deal with anything related to equal pay.  \u0026ldquoWe have made clear we believe pay discrimination is unacceptable and that equal pay claims should be settled as quickly as possible, he said.  \u0026ldquoAs such as we would urge councils, in line with their legal obligations as employers, to resolve any outstanding claims.  Equal pay and pensions: The history  THE Equal Pay Act 1970 made it illegal for employers to offer men and women dferent employment terms, but it wasn\u0026rsquot until 1997 that a UK-wide agreement was put in place to ensure all local authorities complied with the legislation.  It then took until 2010 for all Scottish councils to implement the so-called single status agreement, with most paying compensation to female workers who had been discriminated against up to that point.  Despite this, all councils went on to receive further equal-pay claims in relation to single status itself. The issues raised included the fact that bonuses that only male staff had been entitled to were protected under the new scheme while the job evaluation element of single status deemed some roles done mainly by women to be less valuable than those done mostly by men.\u0026nbsp  In both rounds of claims most councils treated their settlements as compensation, meaning they were neither taxable nor pensionable. In 2014 HMRC ordered that practice to stop, stressing that all equal-pay settlements must be treated as arrears of pay, with tax and pension contributions becoming due as a result. The rules of the Scottish Local Government Pension Scheme were updated to clary the point in the same year.  Not all councils complied, however. In North Lanarkshire, affected women took legal action against their local authority in a bid to have their pensions - which are calculated based on salary - increased to the level they would have been at had they not been underpaid.  In 2016 the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Scottish Public Pensions Agency ordered the council to abide by the law. The effect was to increase the amount the affected women had been paid in the years they were making claims for and, as a result, their pension entitlement too.  The SPPA wrote to all public bodies in the wake of the North Lanarkshire case to \u0026ldquoclary the policy intent that a payment of arrears of pay, made in respect of an equal-pay claim, should be treated as pensionable.  Equal pay and pensions: The impact  LIZ Melrose, who is enjoying a late summer holiday in Tenere, is looking forward to retiring at the end of this year after putting in a 25-year sht at North Lanarkshire Council.  Yet while the thought of entering the next phase of her le is an enticing one, Mrs Melrose admits that money will be tight to begin with because she is taking early retirement and so won\u0026rsquot receive the state pension for another two years.  Despite this, thanks to a fight put up by her and fellow North Lanarkshire staff, the home support worker will be almost \u0026pound1,500 a year better off than she expected to be because the equal-pay settlement she received from the council in 2015 has finally been reflected in her pension.  As a result, Mrs Melrose\u0026rsquos retirement income will rise from \u0026pound5,695 to \u0026pound7,133 a year when she clocks off for the final time in December. While the numbers are not huge, when her state entitlement is factored in in two years\u0026rsquo time it will make the dference, Mrs Melrose says, between being able to continue to take holidays in retirement and not.  \u0026ldquoThat \u0026pound1,500 a year is a substantial increase, she says.  A retired care home warden is in a similar position. Having stopped work 11 years ago after 30 years of service, also with North Lanarkshire Council, the 71-year old had been receiving the incorrect pension every month in the intervening period until, three months ago, it was bumped up by 30 per cent.  It has, she says, \u0026ldquomade quite a big dference to her and her husband\u0026rsquos lives. Her husband agrees, noting that the couple no longer has to be quite so \u0026ldquoguarded about what we\u0026rsquore spending and what we\u0026rsquore not spending.  Yet the outcome is bittersweet, with the woman\u0026rsquos husband noting that due to ill health his we is no longer able to fully enjoy the extra money.  \u0026ldquoThis would have made a big dference to us, a substantial dference, but my we\u0026rsquos heath has deteriorated and deteriorated and she can\u0026rsquot go abroad now because she can\u0026rsquot get insurance, he says.  \u0026ldquoWe both worked all our days and were in the habit of going on a Continental holiday every year until her ill health prevented that.

A Government spokesperson said Ms Sturgeon, who was Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos deputy at the time, had not been aware of concerns raised by the woman.  In January, two women accused Mr Salmond of sexual misconduct when he was First Minister, allegations that were investigated by civil servants.  The probe led to the Government handing over the findings last month to Police Scotland, which has since launched its own investigation.  As revealed by the Herald on Sunday, the police probe is examining a twenty-month period spanning March 2013 to November 2014 - the last month of Salmond\u0026rsquos time in office.  Mr Salmond angrily denounced the internal Government probe, describing the procedure and unlawful and unfair. He denies any sexual harassment and is challenging the civil service process by way of a judicial review.  It was claimed yesterday that one of the women who came forward this year had also made the complaint five years ago.  According to the account, the complaint was resolved after the woman accepted Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos apology for the \u0026ldquomisunderstanding, which took place at Bute House in Edinburgh.  The claims were said to raise questions about why civil servants ordered another investigation this year when the issue had been apparently been dealt with.  Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said:  \"It now appears a complaint was made against Alex Salmond in 2013. If that is true, it contradicts what the public has previously been told about when issues around Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct were first raised, and who dealt with them. It is essential the public is now given a clear timeline of events that have lead to this point, including who knew what - and when.\"  In response to the story, a Scottish Government spokesperson said:  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond. These could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  \u0026ldquoNo complaints were raised with the then Deputy First Minister about Alex Salmond under the previous process and, as we have said, the first the First Minister became aware of the fact of an investigation was from Alex Salmond in April 2018.  Asked whether Ms Sturgeon had been aware that a female staffer had complained about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour in 2013, the spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoNo.  On whether the First Minister was aware that the woman had raised concerns about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour, the spokesperson gave the same response.  A spokesperson for Mr Salmond said: \u0026ldquoWe have no comment to make because our Petition for Judicial Review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session. We expect it to be called very shortly and we intend to do our talking in court. Our objective is to establish that Scottish Government\u0026rsquos complaints procedure used against Alex is unlawful."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-party-no-longer-a-broad-church-says-chris-leslie","story":"  Mr Leslie, a vocal critic of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, became the latest parliamentarian to be censured on Friday, and the first since the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Liverpool.

Martin Redfern  Edinburgh  CHEQUERED PAST OF OUR OWN FLAG  Your story on PoliceScotland\u0027s list of prohibited flags News, September 23 raised some interest. The current saltire is connected to conflict and tension, the inspiration being the cloud formed St Andrew\u0027s cross the Pict army allegedly saw above the battlefields of Athlestaneford in 832. Today it is the civic symbol and also grasped by those pushing for fresh independence referenda.  Flags are not merely innocent fluttering fabric, as police lists attest. They are cementers of nationalism and carriers often purveyors of power and hate. Nationalism is oft formed by what \u0027we are not\u0027 as opposed to defining positively \u0027what we are.\u0027 The saltire, with its links to wars with English Angles, fits that construct.  Of course the blue and white saltire was not always our flag. A black and white, green and white, and red and white saltire have all been committed to cloth before our extant national symbol.  Flags can of course change. If we were to change, I would like to see purple in our saltire. Not only a salute to women suffragettes\u0027 campaign for democracy, but also a symbol of our heathered landscape and thistle.

An internal document obtained by the Herald on Sunday reveals there are now three merger options on the table, two of which would see officers working in Scotland still employed by British Transport Police Authority, with the Scottish Police Authority  given oversight. When the plan to devolve railway policing was first mooted, three options were suggested by BTP.  But Yousaf\u0026rsquos predecessor Michael Matheson, who is now transport minister, rejected the first two options and spent three years trying to force a takeover of the work of BTP in Scotland. Matheson and Yousaf swapped jobs in First Minister Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos summer cabinet reshuffle.  A discussion paper marked \u0026ldquoOFFICIAL circulated to key stakeholders this week at a meeting chaired by Scottish Government civil servants shows that three options are now under consideration. Option one is a \u0026ldquonon-statutory governance arrangement involving BTP and the SPA, option two is described as a \u0026ldquostatutory route which would give the SPA \u0026ldquoenhanced accountability, and option three is \u0026ldquofull integration, a policy the Scottish Government pursued when Matheson was justice minister. Option three could take eight years to implement, according to the report.  Rail trade union the Transport Salaried Staffs\u0027 Association , which represents BTP staff in Scotland, said the Scottish Government had performed a \u0026ldquoU-turn and called on Sturgeon to sack Matheson for \u0026ldquoincompetence.  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said millions of pounds had been spent on an \u0026ldquounworkable merger and Yousaf should now \u0026ldquojunk the original plan altogether.  The s of BTP in Scotland were due to be absorbed into the national force in April next year but Matheson announced in February that the merger had been postponed, amid concerns about IT and pensions arrangements.  The move followed a scathing report from Scotland\u0027s police watchdog which said no authoritative business case was made for the integration. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland, Derek Penman, said a detailed study of the risks should be undertaken.  Penman praised BTP officers and staff for their professionalism amid uncertainty about their position. BTP has 213 officers, 38 police staff and 26 special officers in Scotland, who are charged with looking after 358 stations and 1700 miles of track.  After Yousaf took over the justice department, he announced he would \u0026ldquore-examine all options for the devolution of railway policing, which was originally recommended by the cross-party Smith Commission in 2014.  A Joint Programme Board  was set up in 2017 to integrate BTP in Scotland into Police Scotland. It is chaired by the Scottish Government and UK government\u0026rsquos Department for Transport , and includes representatives from BTP, the SPA and Police Scotland.  A JPB paper circulated this week set out the three options and said each of them \u0026ldquowill be tested on merit as a standalone solution to deliver devolved accountability and responsibility or as part of a phased approach which may progress to full integration to achieve the desired aim.  The report said the SPA does not currently have the s to deliver railway policing. This echoes an SPA report presented to the body\u0026rsquos finance committee last month which said some services may have to be outsourced, resulting in \u0026ldquosignicant dferences to the actual cost base for Police Scotland in integrating BTP-Scotland.  The JPB report, obtained by the Herald on Sunday, states: \u0026ldquoThe options appraisal will provide an evidence-based comparison, considering strategic fit with recommendations from the Smith Commission benefits case risks/impact to the safe and effective management and operational delivery of railway policing in Scotland and the UK and costs \u0026ndash including value for money and affordability.  The document said the timeframe to \u0026ldquogenerate, capture and test the three options will be just over two months, and the justice minister will update the cabinet in early December, with an update provided to MSPs who sit on the Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos justice committee by the end of the year.  TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s taken three long years for the Scottish Government to finally accept what our members have told it from the outset \u0026ndash that the breakup of BTP and its merger with Police Scotland was unnecessary and unfeasible.  \u0026ldquoIt continues to be unwanted by anyone connected with our railways in Scotland because it puts passengers and our members at peril. Let\u0027s face it, BTP and Police Scotland themselves never wanted it either.  \u0026ldquoThe U-turn is the right thing to do. It\u0027s just a crying shame it\u0027s taken them so long to make it. The paper circulated at the Joint Programme Board earlier this week represents a signicant change of heart away from the entrenched nationalism surrounding the earlier decision by former justice minister Michael Matheson.  Cortes praised Yousaf for \u0026ldquohaving the decency to review the merger and the \u0026ldquopolitical courage to force his party to accept that it made a mistake.  The union leader said BTP staff and officers deserve an apology and \u0026ldquorecompense for the unnecessary amount of stress and anxiety forced upon them by Matheson\u0027s idiotic policy for the last three years.  An impact report by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research  found that 83 per cent of staff and officers who took part in a survey were unsupportive of the merger. \u0026ldquoThe responses to the online survey demonstrated a deep strain of scepticism, cynicism and opposition towards the integration of BTP s into devolved policing structures, said the report.  Co-author of the SCCJR report Dr Kath Murray welcomed the decision to consider the original options. \u0026ldquoIt suggests a sht away from full integration as an end in its own right, towards an effective devolution arrangement, the criminal justice researcher told the Herald on Sunday. \u0026ldquoRetaining the single specialist service within a devolved accountability structure would allow railway policing in Scotland to be underpinned by principles set by the Scottish Government, build on the respective strengths of the BTP and Police Scotland, and crucially, remove the signicant challenges to date, including the risks to public safety and costs to the public purse.  The TSSA\u0026rsquos Cortes said reasoned arguments made to Matheson about the impact of the merger on staff and officers fell on \u0026ldquodeaf ears. \u0026ldquoHe never once got that safety and crime prevention on our railways is far too important to be treated like a political football, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s why we now have deep reservations about his position as transport secretary. Put simply, nobody in our business trusts the man or has any confidence in him. Yousaf\u0027s decision to overturn the injustice done to transport police staff is an indication of Matheson\u0026rsquos lack of judgement. And frankly, Matheson should be made to resign for his incompetence. It\u0027s inconceivable that he can carry on in the transport brief.  Cortes added: \u0026ldquoWhilst I welcome the Joint Programme Board\u0027s latest thinking, make no mistake, this is also an embarrassing climbdown for the SNP. If they want us to believe they have integrity when it comes to security and transport policy then they don\u0027t just need to sink this dangerous and mindless merger proposal, they need to sack Matheson who has no right to expect trust to be vested in him again.  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said: \u0026ldquoWhen alternative, less risky options were put forward the Scottish Government dismissed them in a high-handed fashion, choosing instead to barrel ahead with the abolition of the BTP in Scotland without even bothering to develop a proper business case.  \u0026ldquoThat decision cost millions of pounds, shredded the confidence of staff and took us back to square one. It\u0026rsquos no wonder that officer\u0027s representatives have been so critical of ministers\u0027 handling .  \u0026ldquoFor BTP officers and staff the future remains uncertain. The new justice secretary needs to junk the original plan altogether, given two years of work has shown it to be unworkable, and squarely focus on the other viable options for the future of this service.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoAs the Justice Secretary highlighted to the Justice Committee recently, there is a need to identy interim arrangements that could give effect quickly to the devolution of railway policing, as recommended by the Smith Commission.  \u0026ldquoIn August, the Justice Secretary committed to re-examining all options with Police Scotland, the Scottish Police Authority, the British Transport Police and other partners. This process is currently underway and is being discussed by the Joint Programme Board. An update on the next steps will be provided in due course.    TIMELINE OF AN ATTEMPTED MERGER  Smith Commission published its report on further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament and railway policing was one of those areas.  British Transport Police sets out three options for future devolution of transport policing in Scotland. The third option \u0026ndash breaking up BTP and amalgamating Scottish operations into Police Scotland \u0026ndash is described as the \u0026ldquomost complex. This option would have implications for employment and pension arrangements, as well as financial and legal liabilities.  Scotland Act 2016 is given royal assent, which passed the recommendations of the Smith Commission into law.  The Scottish Government launched a consultation on option three, the integration of railway policing.  Consultation responses are published, showing \u0026ldquomuch opposition to the policy. \u0026ldquoMany considered that a strong case for integration had not been made, said the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos executive summary.  A survey of TSSA members found a third would leave BTP in the event of a merger.  The Railway Policing  Act was passed and TSSA launched a petition opposing the merger, which attracted more than 11,000 supporters  The merger, which was due to be implemented in April 2019, was postponed by former justice minister Michael Matheson.  New justice minister Humza Yousaf announces a review which will explore further options.    THE 2015 AND 2018 OPTIONS    Option One  This option is the simplest route to achieve devolution \u0026ndash that is, through administrative means, rather than legislation.  Option Two  This option consists of a number of measures, both legislative and administrative, to devolve transport policing within Scotland.  Option Three  This is the most complex route to devolution and it would entail breaking up BTP and absorbing its Scottish operations into Police Scotland.    Option 1  Establish a governance arrangement  through BTPA and SPA .  Option 2  Establish a model for SPA enhanced accountability and responsibility in the delivery of railway policing in Scotland .  Option 3  Proceed to full integration, with date to be informed by Police Scotland ."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-government-backs-greater-human-rights-checks-on-firms-after-dodgy-10bn-china-deal","story":"  Public bodies will also have to undertake stricter due diligence on potential commercial partners in the wake of the Government\u0026rsquos botched \u0026pound10bn investment agreement with a Chinese consortium.  In 2016, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signed a \u0026ldquomemorandum of understanding with SinoFortone and China Railway No. 3 Engineering Group  at Bute House.  At the time, SinoFortone said the partnership could lead to \"signicant investment\" in areas including clean energy, transport and affordable housing in Scotland.  Ms Sturgeon did not publicise the agreement when it was struck and details only came to light after reports surfaced in the Chinese press.  It then emerged that CR3 parent company, China Railway Group , had been blacklisted by Norway\u0026rsquos oil fund following corruption allegations.  The ethics council of the Norwegian pension fund warned in 2014 there was a \"high degree of probability\" the firm \"paid bribes to government officials for contracts regarding construction of railways and housing projects\" in China.  The negative publicity was followed by the companies withdrawing from the memorandum and the proposal collapsed.  It was then revealed last year that the London-registered SinoFortune had failed to carry out many of the projects it had been linked to.  The report stated that the firm had not registered any company accounts and the only deal it had finalised was the purchase of a Buckinghamshire pub - the Plough Inn at Cadsden.  Sir Richard Heygate, who was SinoFortune\u0026rsquos UK agent, later described the firm as \u0026ldquoall bollocks. He added: \u0026ldquoIt shows how careless the first minister was to put pen to paper on a deal with Chinese companies she knew absolutely nothing about.\"  In June, the Government released its \u0026ldquoengagement strategy with China, but it also published a \u0026ldquoguidance document on due diligence and human rights for public bodies.  According to the recommendations, the Government and its quangos should assess whether a company, including a parent firm or subsidiary, has been linked to human rights abuses anywhere in the world. The checks would apply to where \u0026ldquodirect financial support is provided through grants, loans, financial investments and equity shares.  Non-financial support, such as when the Government acts as a broker between \u0026ldquotwo or more private sector partners, would also be put under the microscope.  Ministers have insisted the \u0026ldquoinitial checking should take place ahead of any meetings and more \u0026ldquosubstantive due diligence should occur as the relationship \u0026ldquodevelops and deepens.  The document also notes: \u0026ldquoCan the organisation or investor provide assurance on financial viability? Does it have any past record of financial wrongdoing, for example bribery or corruption?  Two months after the guidance was published, it was revealed that jobs quango Scottish Enterprise had given arms manufacturer Raytheon nearly \u0026pound200,000 between 2014 and 2017.  Raytheon makes guidance systems for Paveway missiles, which have been used by Saudi Arabia for bombings in Yemen.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \"It shouldn\u0027t taken 15 months to produce this guidance after Keith Brown had to apologise to Parliament for signing a dodgy deal with some shady companies. These new proposals need to be rigorously enforced on and we will be keeping a close eye on whether they\u0026rsquore up to the job.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said the guidance produced is sufficient."},{"url":null,"title":"tories-to-set-out-plans-for-open-government-approach","story":"  The discussion paper, to be published next week, signals the beginning of a campaign for a Scottish Conservative government, the party said.

The Senate Judiciary Committee has said the probe should be limited to \u0026ldquocurrent credible allegations against Mr Kavanaugh and be finished by next Friday.  Leaving the hearing on Friday, Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said it was his understanding there would be an FBI investigation of \u0026ldquothe outstanding allegations, the three of them, but Republicans have not said whether that was their understanding as well.

Mr Ri, standing at a podium at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, said North Korea was ready to implement the points that his leader, Kim Jong Un, and US president Donald Trump agreed to in June during a summit in Singapore.  But his comments were infused with what came across as impatience at the slow pace of progress in a process the world hopes will cause Pyongyang to abandon an arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that aims to accurately target the entire US mainland.  In recent weeks, Mr Kim has said he would permanently dismantle North Korea\u0026rsquos main nuclear complex, but only  the US takes unspecied corresponding measures.  Mr Kim has also promised to accept international inspectors to monitor the closing of a key missile test site and launch pad.  The North, however, does not \u0026ldquosee any corresponding response from Washington. On the contrary, Mr Ri said, the US is increasing pressure and sanctions.  \u0026ldquoThe perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant of us, he said, adding that the continued sanctions were \u0026ldquodeepening our mistrust and deadlocking the current diplomacy.  \u0026ldquoWithout any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security\u0026hellipand under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first, he said.  There was no immediate response from Washington. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week he would  to Pyongyang to set up a sequel to the Singapore meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Trump.  Once the Singapore agreements are implemented, the \u0026ldquocurrent trend toward detente will turn into durable peace and the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula will also be achieved, Mr Ri said. \u0026ldquoThe Korean Peninsula, the hottest spot in the globe, will become the cradle of peace and prosperity.  After their summit in Singapore, Mr Trump and Mr Kim issued a vague statement about a nuclear-free peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.  Post-summit nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang were rocky and quickly settled into a stalemate. There is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that it likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety."},{"url":null,"title":"young-man-24-whose-disappearance-is-out-of-character-may-be-in-glasgow","story":"  Justin Conroy, 24, was reported missing by his family.

The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland is performing at venues across the country as part of its ‘Walking with Heroes’ centenary tour which is aiming to raise tens of thousands of pounds for Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.                                                    Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.                                                     Members of the band local to the area recently joined Aberdeen Provost Barney Crockett and the Poppyscotland team to spread the word about the eagerly anticipated concert.        Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank.

He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Sunday 30 Sep 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

My organisation, Walking to Save Dogs, raises funds to support carefully selected local shelters and projects that rescue dogs from these Festivals and the meat trade.\u0026ldquoThe ultimate goal is to put an end to the dog-meat trade through education that dogs are sentient beings, changing legislation, and providing dog-meat traders with alternative means to support their families.Robert aims to reach John O\u0026rsquoGroats by September 18, although he has already lost one of his canine companions.He added: \u0026ldquoSadly, Madeleine recently developed an eye problem so has gracefully pawed out.\u0026ldquoShe continues to support the rest of the pack from a comfy armchair at home.\u0026ldquoMy pets are the voice of millions of less fortunate dogs.\u0026ldquoThey have been well-prepared for this task and they love the outdoors.\u0026ldquoWe have been walking 12 miles a day on average and hope to finish our walk within a couple of weeks.\u0026ldquoI am touched beyond words at the kindness and generosity of the Scottish people I have met along the trail and look forward to meeting lots more on the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats.To follow Robert\u0026rsquos progress and to donate, go to: www.walkingtosavedogs or www.justgiving/crowdfunding/walkingtosavedogsSunday 30 Sep 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117727.jpg","title":"Grand Tour takes Paul to Altnabreac and Kildonan","story":"\u0026nbspTV presenter Paul Murton makes his way to Caithness and Sutherland in next week\u0027s edition of his current series, Grand Tours of Scotland\u0027s Lochs.During the course of the half-hour programme Paul heads to one of Britain\u0027s remotest railway stations, Altnabreac.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a 6km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature \u0026ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said \u0026pound500,000 in total\u0026nbsp would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat \u0026ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotSunday 30 Sep 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgSunday 30 Sep 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would close  the new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed store\u0026rsquos grounds \u0026ndash another 6000 sq ft building and one covering 2500 sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for 79 cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the future  the site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: \u0026ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shop\u0026rsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move \u0026ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community council\u0026rsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new \u0026pound4million care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community council\u0026rsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: \u0026ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Street  allowed. The care home  has set a precedent so can\u0026rsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: \u0026ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care home\u0026rsquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar panels was incomplete and that some \u0026ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, \u0026ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: \u0026ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar panels.Mr Black offered an apology for the audit\u0026rsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: \u0026ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and it\u0026rsquos costing us a lot of money. That can\u0026rsquot be changed unless we\u0026rsquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to \u0026ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: \u0026ldquoThe council\u0026rsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. It\u0026rsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that \u0026lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive year\u0026rsquo is cold comfort. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage.\u0026ldquoPerhaps I shouldn\u0026rsquot be surprised.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807378.1538303942!/image/image.jpg","title":"insight booze and you lose the new mantra for scottish teens","story":"        When Susan and Brendan McFadyens\u0026#8217 three sons were still quite young, the couple took an unusual decision. Inspired by friends in Ireland, they decided to offer each of their boys a lump sum  they could make it to their 18th birthdays without consuming any alcohol.                The logic for this was impeccable: not only would the money be a powerful motivating factor to stay sober – and research shows every extra year of not drinking makes a dference to young people’s health – but it would give them a valid excuse to offer up to friends putting pressure on them to succumb.            The two older boys, Chris and Tony, have already made the target, marking the achievement with a rite-of-passage pint with their father. The youngest, Andrew, 12, seems committed to following in his brothers’ footsteps.            Chris, now 23 and an assistant teacher at a secondary school, was so keen to reach the goal he survived a sixth-year holiday to Magaluf without surrendering to the siren call of the infamous goldfish bowls full of red and green cocktails.A keen footballer, Chris says he noticed the dference between his fitness levels and the fitness levels of his peers who took alcohol. “When I went to [Stirling] University I was so much fitter, probably because I hadn’t drunk for five or six years, so I ended up playing for East Stirling. Before that, when I played for an under-19s team, I noticed some of the boys had beer bellies – I was looking at them and thinking: ‘How can that be?’ They must have been drinking since they were 13.”Though he does now drink socially, there is, he says, another idend from his years of abstinence: he can – when he wants – enjoy a night out without alcohol. “I don’t feel I need to drink to have a good time like some of my \u2028friends do.”The McFadyens’ approach is unusual, and many parents would not be able to afford to offer their children a cash incentive. But a recent World Health Organisation report – based on research led by the University of St Andrews – has found drinking amongst young teenagers in Scotland has declined dramatically in the last 16 years.According to the study of 36 European countries, weekly drinking among 15-year-olds dropped from 41 per cent to 11 per cent in girls and from 41 per cent to 14 per cent among boys between 2002 and 2014. Consumption of spirits by girls in Scotland also dropped signicantly from 37 per cent to 7 per cent.             Jo Inchley, senior research fellow in the School of Medicine at the University of St Andrews, said overall the decreases were highest in those countries that traditionally had the highest prevalence, such as the UK and Nordic countries.Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, believes the new study is positive even  the 15-year-olds go on to drink when they turn 18.“There’s evidence that the earlier you start drinking the more severe the consequences,” she says. “For every year you delay initiating drinking you reduce the risk of alcohol dependency by 14 per cent.”“Also, there is evidence that  you start at age 12, then at age 20-22 you are more likely to have been arrested and more likely to have a drink and drug problem compared with those who started at 14, and so on, so I think it’s good news that young people are starting later.”            Better still, it does not appear that one vice is replacing another. According to the Scottish Schools Adolescent Lestyle Substance Use Survey  the consumption of tobacco and illicit drugs is following a similar downward trend.No-one is sure yet what is driving the decline, which is being replicated across the western world. The Wellcome Trust has given Sheffield University funding to investigate the phenomenon. Its initial report published last week suggested a range of possible factors including: immigration from non-drinking cultures, shts in parenting styles, the rise of internet-based technologies, changing norms around drinking and improved enforcement of underage sales restrictions. “One of the hypotheses is that it’s harder for young people to buy alcohol these days and I’m sure with Challenge 25 [the policy that encourages retailers to check the ID of anyone who looks under 25] and a bit more scrutiny of licensed premises, they probably are being a bit more thorough,” says Douglas.“But the evidence from SALSUS suggests that the majority of young people who are getting hold of alcohol are getting it from the home or from relatives. So, I do think there is something more profound going on here. Children and young people are socialising in a dferent way – they are much more social media-focused they are more likely to be on their devices rather than down the park or hanging out at the bus stops.”In Scotland, they may also be affected by the Scottish Government’s minimum pricing policy, which has pushed up the price of cheaper alcohol such as Frosty Jack cider. But since the policy was only introduced in May, there is, as yet, no information on whether or not it is reducing consumption.             I have had a mixed experience with my own three sons. The oldest didn’t drink at all until he was just shy of 18. Looking back, he says he didn’t like the taste and was scared of how it might affect him. The second didn’t drink at 15, but was drunk to the point of throwing up at 16 . At 18, he is a footballer and disciplined about not drinking before training and games. The youngest is 14 and doesn’t drink . All of them played a fair bit on the Xbox, but whether this was the reason they didn’t drink, or an escape from tricky social situations where they might feel obliged to drink, is dficult to assess. Elise Cochrane, 19, made the decision never to drink at the age of nine after witnessing the destructive power of alcohol. “My nana was an alcoholic and over the years I saw the damage it did to everyone in my family,” she says. “It caused so much misery, I wouldn’t have wanted to touch the stuff. By the time she died [of alcohol-related conditions] my nana had pretty much alienated herself from the family because we had all tried for a really long time to get her to stop. I found it quite dficult when my friends drank because I had seen the bad side of alcohol. It made me worry to see them not take it seriously to hear them talking about going and getting drunk. It brought back bad memories for me. Many of them thought it was funny and treated it as a joke, because, presumably, they hadn’t had the same experiences.”Seventeen-year-old Havana Sillars doesn’t drink because she can’t be bothered with the hassle. “Obviously you can’t buy alcohol at my age so there is the whole issue of ‘what happens  we get caught?’ And I don’t really like the taste. Sometimes my mum will offer me something and I will take it and think: ‘This is not nice.’”Other abstemious teenagers I spoke to were motivated by not wanting to lose control or put themselves in danger. James Ross is 15 and sings with a band, but despite the rock and roll stereotype, none of his bandmates drink they would all rather focus on their music. “A few of my friends drink, but I don’t because, first of all, my parents would definitely find out and I don’t want to get into trouble. “But also when I have been out and some of my friends have had a drink they aren’t in control of their own actions. They don’t seem properly aware of what’s going on and I feel like more of a babysitter than a friend.“I have one friend who was out drinking and the group got attacked and my friend had to go to hospital with his injuries. He couldn’t defend himself. Obviously, I don’t want that to happen to me.”James, who is in fourth year and preparing for his National 5s, is also concerned about the impact drinking might have on his schoolwork. “We have talks in PSE [Personal and Social Education] on how alcohol affects your brain’s development. There’s just no real positive outcome from drinking at my age.”Of course, in the teenage years there can be peer pressure to drink . “If my friends are drinking they will say, ‘Do you want some,’ and I will say, ‘No.’ But I admit sometimes it can be tempting,” James admits. “You think, ‘It’s just a sip, no-one is going to notice,’ but once you have a sip you may as well have drunk a whole bottle. That’s not to say any of my friends bully me, but there is some sort of pressure there.”For a growing number of young Scots, then, getting drunk is not as fundamental a part of growing up as it was a generation or so ago. Yet Douglas cautions against becoming complacent.Although the survey showed a steady decline in the drinking of 15-year-olds, it found a third had been drunk twice or more in their letime. This figure was down from around 50 per cent in 2002, but still placed Scotland in the top 10 in Europe. More than a quarter of girls in Scotland  and almost a third of boys  started drinking alcohol at 13 or younger.In addition, according to the Scottish Health Survey, 27 per cent of young people aged between 16 and 24 are drinking more than the recommended 14 units a week . “That’s people who are potentially putting their health at risk,” says Douglas. “That proportion is quite high – higher than most other age groups apart from the 45 to 54-year-olds and the 55 to 64-year-olds where the figures are 28 per cent and 31 per cent respectively. “The thing is with young people, you have the risks of violence, accidents, unprotected sex, unplanned pregnancies and suicide, particularly among young men,” says Douglas. “We have also developed a greater understanding around the neuro-physiological effects. The brain is still developing and doing some really crucial wiring up in the teenage years, so there is a risk of temporary and permanent cognitive impairment, particularly  they are drinking heavily over a sustained period.” Douglas believes we need to be alert to potential changes in the way alcohol is being promoted. As drinking among young people declines, it is likely the industry will sht more and more of its marketing into the online spaces they frequent in order to lure them back. The industry will also be trying to come up with millennial-friendly products to keep the money rolling in. Alcopops – which appeal to beginners – were a direct response to a decline in profits in the 90s when young people started using Ecstasy instead of alcohol. “My fear would be: where will the industry be going next in terms of maintaining their market?” says Douglas. “There’s some evidence of a sht into drinks that imply greater purity or have fruit on the label. There’s a Smirnoff advert that involves smashing fruit, Absolut Vodka has a wide range of dferent fruit flavours. And then you see the advent of skinny lagers which are low in carbs and calories, gluten free, vegan-friendly. That to me is clearly making a play for millennial women.”Another teenage phenomenon is Dragon Soop – which combines vodka with caffeine – and is marketed in cans similar to hi-energy soft drinks such as Relentless. One of the astonishing things about Dragon Soop – beyond its lurid, carpet-staining colour – is that each 500ml can contains four units. The fact it contains four units is clearly marked so you can “Drink Aware”, but for many young people this serves more as a boast than a warning.“I think  you are in the business of creating alcohol products and trying to sell those products you will be adapting to the changing wishes of consumers. If we are lucky that will mean lower and no alcohol products  we are unlucky it will mean whatever appeals to Generation Y,” says Douglas.Increasingly, however, it seems Generation Y is losing its lust for liquor. Take Ciaran McAndrew. At 17, he doesn’t drink partly because he doesn’t like it and partly because he plays under-18s football with Hamilton Academical FC. “When I go to parties, I try to focus on other things. For example, I like music so I will take charge of that or I will chat with people I don’t see often. I find other ways to get round it,” he says. “I quite like not drinking because I can get my pals home safe. I like knowing they are all right.”Like many young men of his age, Ciaran is looking forward to a trip to Zante when school finishes in June, but he has no interest in getting slaughtered on the strip and collapsing on a sun lounger at dawn. “It will be a dferent experience for me, for sure, but I am buzzing for it,” he says. “I enjoy myself better not going out and getting steaming. The others will be lying in their beds until the afternoon and I will be out on the beach.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

It is where direction is set, policy is \u0026#173formulated, and political leadership is given, based on the everyday lived experiences of people in workplaces, and communities right across the country.                It is the forum where ideas are exchanged and tested – and nowhere is that more the case than at conference fringe events, such as The World Transformed series, held in a brewery converted into a ­theatre space just a few miles from the main conference venue.            It is always a pleasure and a privilege to participate in this ­cauldron of ideas – and this week was no dferent. The fringe ­meeting was chaired by Ed Miliband and included economic thinkers ­Martin O’Neill and Grace Blakeley, and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy.             Some of the ideas were radical, like the call to revolutionise the UK banking system. Others were reconnecting with Labour’s socialistic traditions, like economic democracy and co-operative ownership, whilst yet others looked to a future built on automation, new science and reduced and shared working time. That these ideas were aired at the conference fringe was perhaps not exceptional, that they found a ready echo in platform speeches in the main conference hall was.It was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell who embraced much of this radical thinking, converting it into concrete policy proposals for an incoming Labour government. In his main address, he outlined plans to increase public ownership, including building a new frontier of worker ownership. He pledged to establish a Public and Community Ownership Unit in the Treasury. The unit will bring in external experts to advise on and implement the transfer of PFI schemes out of the private sector. That means public services will once again be owned by the public, because ­people have had enough of being ripped off by privatisation.His plans for the private sector also include action to clamp down on the industrial scale tax avoiders who are denying our hospitals, our schools and carers of the resources they need. Mobilising shareholder power to demand that companies uphold basic tax justice standards and ensuring that they meet the Fair Tax Mark standards is a central part of this approach.In a bid to rebalance power in the economy, he has outlined ­proposals to promote employee ownership in larger companies through share issues.This has some resemblance to the ideas designed by Hans Meidner in Sweden some years ago – an approach which I have championed for some time. In most European economies these ideas are mainstream – and it is a measure of how desperately our country needs real change that they are considered by some to be “left-field”.            In my main address to conference, I built on this radical thinking and applied it to Scotland, because it is clear we need Scottish solutions to Scottish problems and Scottish challenges. So, for instance, there is no Scottish Government ­industrial strategy. We need one with an enhanced role for workers and their unions in a more planned approach to the Scottish economy. Taking water back into public ownership is a pressing demand in England, but – thanks to a ­dramatic intervention by Labour in the then Strathclyde Regional Council, who famously ran a referendum to oppose water privatisation with a 71 per cent turn out and a 97 per cent rejection rate in the 1990s – we don’t need to take water into public ­ownership here. But that is not to say though that we may not need to reform the lines of its accountability and democratic oversight. One area where we ­definitely need change is on the long-standing question on the ­ownership of land. Fewer than 500 landowners own half of all private land in Scotland. To find more just land solutions means we will have to give some consideration to tax ­measures, ownership limits and residential qualications. We should certainly take the railways into public ownership, and look at the ownership and provision of bus and ferry services. With so much of our economy over dependent on overseas ownership and foreign direct investment – meaning it operates largely a branch plant – we need to look urgently at what we can do to rebalance economic ownership. One way is by taking the lead on measures like a statutory right for workers to own the company that they are employed in when it is put up for sale or facing closure. Such a boost to co-operative and employee ownership would ­relocalise ­control and lock in more local accountability.             Scotland is, after all, the birthplace of the first workers’ co-operative, in Fenwick, Ayrshire, and became the home of father of the co-operative movement, Robert Owen. Rebalancing the distribution of financial instruments like regional selective assistance to target investments by indigenous rather than overseas businesses is also the right thing to do. So the idea of a world transformed is therefore central to the mainstream thinking of the party. These policy proposals are not made in the abstract, but in the real-world context of Brexit, the May Government’s failing negotiations and the growing likelihood of a UK general election in the next few months. This week, John McDonnell said: “The greater the mess we inherit, the more radical we have to be the greater the need for change, the greater the opportunity we have to create that change, and we will.”As this week underlined, a Jeremy Corbyn-led government is up to that challenge and in Scotland the radical economic and social programme that the people need is finding new vitality and relevance.         \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806731.1538130515!/image/image.jpg","title":"port of cromarty on crest of a wave","story":"        The Port of Cromarty Firth has recorded its best ever year after turnover jumped by \u0026#1631 million, helping to fuel further investment.                Annual turnover rose to £9.9m – the highest in the port’s 40-year history, new figures have revealed.            Bosses said the strong financial position would enable the business to continue to invest in major developments, such as the new quayside and laydown space, which is in the planning stages to be built through the next couple of years.            The past year was described as an “extremely busy one” for the port, which saw it ersy from its core business of oil and gas to renewables, decommissioning and cruise.Chief executive Bob Buskie said: “At the start of 2016, with low oil and gas prices, we knew the port had to adapt to sustain our growth and help keep local people in work.“Firstly, supporting our core customers in oil and gas was a key concern. After the necessary consultation, we introduced a new pricing for statutory dues in January 2017, which meant an average 5 per cent reduction in fees for most clients, supporting them through the downturn.  “Secondly, the port had to look to the future and see what we could do to help sustain jobs and growth. This is where our ersication strategy came in, with 2017 seeing us undertake a project to introduce decommissioning to the port in an open port policy, where our supply chain could bid for work under our licences.”Cruise continued to be a success story in 2017, with the port being named as the busiest in Scotland. In another record-breaking year, the facility welcomed 93 ships and more than 150,000 passengers to the Highlands. This represented a 54 per cent increase on 2016.            The direct spend from these passengers was worth more than £15m to the local economy and provided a boost to a range of attractions.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807389.1538254567!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit damaging tory reputation for economic competence says dominic grieve","story":"        Brexit is jeopardising the Conservative Party\u0026#8217s reputation as the party of \u0026#8220economic competence\u0026#8221, Dominic Grieve has warned, after a poll of business leaders showed low support for its trade policies.                A poll of entrepreneurs and executives revealed that just 26% believed the party was “pursuing business-friendly policies”, with almost one in six  disagreeing.            Two-thirds  said they regarded the Conservatives as traditionally pursuing policies that “increase prosperity and help well-run businesses”.            : MP data leak after Tory conference app security failureThe survey of more than 1,000 people carried out for the People’s Vote, which wants a second Brexit referendum, found that even those whose businesses did no export trade with the EU were split 50-50 in terms of Leave v Remain.Among those whose turnover was more than 10% derived from EU exports, it rose to 70-30 in favour of Remain.Overall the split was 59-41 for Remain, with a similar split, 57-43, supporting a new referendum once “don’t knows” were removed.Mr Grieve, the former attorney general and pro-Remain MP who backs another vote, said: “This poll highlights the extent that the Conservative Party is jeopardising its reputation for economic competence with the business community as a result of the way Brexit has unfolded.            “This should be a wake-up call because our party is risking everything for which we have always stood.“Those sections of the party which are guided by the ideology of Brexit have only served to damage the ability of the Government to get any positive outcome from these negotiations.”YouGov polled 1,004 people for the People’s Vote between September 18 and 26.More than four in 10  said le had become harder for their business since the referendum, with just 9% saying it had become easier.            Almost three-quarters  believed Britain would get a bad deal and 64% said they believed that would be the fault of the Government.Almost two-thirds of the business leaders said they would rather trade freely than control immigration.Melvin Benn, the managing director of Festival Republic, which is behind some of the UK’s largest music events including Reading and Leeds, Download, Latitude, V Festival and Wireless, said Brexit might damage the UK’s “cultural ersity”.He said: “Every year the festivals I run welcome artists and performers from across Europe and the world.“They benefit from our open borders but also love the tolerant and inclusive country which we have become.            “A hard or no-deal Brexit would not only create worrying commercial dficulties for my industry, but would cripple the economy and potentially strand our artists at passport control when they should be striding on to the main stage.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807343.1538245523!/image/image.jpg","title":"women s football shows drink and gambling the red card","story":"        The grassroots body for women\u0026#8217s football in Scotland has vowed to keep the game \u0026#8220clean\u0026#8221 in the face of overtures from the alcohol and gambling industries who are courting it for sponsorship deals.                Big companies are queueing up to get involved in the women’s game, with the stock of the Scotland Women’s national team at an all-time high given the recent qualication for next year’s World Cup in France and their participation in last year’s UEFA Women’s Championship.             However, Vivienne MacLaren, the chair of Scottish Women’s Football, told Scotland on Sunday the organisation that looks after domestic competitions has “knocked back” sponsorship deals from alcohol and gambling in the past and will continue to do so. This is at odds with the men’s game, where all the major competitions in Scotland are sponsored by betting companies, including the Ladbrokes Premiership, the William Hill Scottish Cup and the BetFred Cup.            Last week the Scottish Football Association  and drinks company Diageo launched a campaign to promote responsible drinking. They hope to reach a million Scots with the Drink Positive campaign. The initiative will use the William Hill Scottish Cup to encourage fans, coaches and players to be aware of the effects of alcohol and to encourage moderate drinking.MacLaren said she understands why clubs in Scotland take sponsorship money from drink and gambling giants, given they are the only ones with substantial budgets to spend on football. But she is quick to stress the women’s game is striving to offer a dferent proposition.MacLaren said: “In Scotland alcohol and gambling are two of the biggest scourges. A massive percentage of our members registered to play football are under 18, so we feel we have a real duty to make sure the brands we are associating with and the message we are putting out are positive ones.“We don’t want to take money when there’s girls playing football out there who can’t afford to get to training. We’re trying to help clubs support their players.There’s kids that can’t afford football boots and yet there’s alcohol and gambling brands around a lot of sports.”            The Scottish Government announced additional funding for the national team squad ahead of next year’s World Cup, which will allow them to train full-time.MacLaren said: “For us to bring in dferent types of sponsors we have to position women’s football as a dferent proposition. It’s a partnership, it’s about education.“We want to give something back to the players and the volunteers that play and help week in, week out.” Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland and a vehement critic of the SFA link with Diageo, said: “Alcohol marketing should have no place in sport.             “By linking their brands to sports events and teams, alcohol companies imply that drinking is part of a healthy and active le. In fact, alcohol is a cause of cancer, heart disease, liver disease and stroke and was responsible for 3,705 Scots losing their lives in 2015.”Dr Peter Rice, chair of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems, warned: “Research has shown high levels of alcohol brand awareness among 11 and 12-year-old children in the UK, and much of this awareness comes from sports sponsorship, especially football.“The advertising regulation codes written by the alcohol and advertising industries themselves say that advertising should not associate alcohol with fitness or sporting success.“These codes are designed for broadcast and media advertising, but sponsorship clearly achieves the same marketing goals for companies and we believe is used to get around regulation.“It would be unacceptable to have a beer advert in a magazine aimed at children, yet children see Champions League games ‘brought to them’ by a beer company.            “This is an inappropriate association and we would ultimately like to see the end of it in football, and we commend the Scottish women’s game for their leadership.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change.

partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a

Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who

have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished

But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview \n Ruairí Doyle\n\n“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TD\nSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. \nHe also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. \nSpeaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.\nThe Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the 1980’s. \nThis informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, even  it were 40 or 50 years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.\nPearse, who has been a TD since 2010, talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. \nThe Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. \nHe said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,  I am in thatposition.”\nSinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.\nPearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. \nThis is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”\nHe continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €2.5 billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”\nAs Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.\nDeputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  \n“What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  \n“It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”\nTouching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the 26 Counties.\nPearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. \nHe continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  \n“And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”\nSinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. \nThis Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. \nTeachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athome  that’s what they wish.” \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"happiest places in northern ireland revealed and the most miserable","story":"                \nScores were produced for council area by the Office of National Statistics  based on four measures of personal well-being - le satisfaction, feeling that the things done in le are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHealth, employment and relationship status are key determinants of personal well-being according to previous research done by the ONS.

Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E.

Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E.

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"\nA spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.\n\n                \nThe church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Church\u0027s Harvest service\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church.

We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. \n\n“There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nMinister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.\n\n“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOf the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.\n\n“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”\n\nThe Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October 7 at 11.30am and 7pm.\n\nRev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from 3pm to 6pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”\n\n

Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"\nTHE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted 6000 responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.\n\nMr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation. The campaign also took the opportunity to highlight their campaign objectives: raising awareness of the Time for Truth advice clinics across Belfast on Saturday, September 29 and working to see  institutions for dealing with the past up and running.\n\nCampaign spokesman Ciarán MacAirt said: “We were very grateful for the time that the Deputy Director of the NIO took to listen to the families of the Time for Truth campaign. After handing over 6000 responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”\n\n“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on 5th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.\n\n“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now. Any other delay will see the families of the Time for Truth campaign take to the streets as we did in February of this year when 7000 victims and survivors, friends and supporters joined our March for Truth.” \n"},{"url":null,"title":"airline norwegian ends belfast to new york and boston flights","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Requiem Mass will take place at St Mary\u0027s in Drumragh on Sunday.\n\nIn a tribute posted on the Glenavon FC website, Mr Hamilton said: \"It\u0027s a tough time for the family, a tough time for everybody. \n\n\"Since Faye and I got together he\u0027s been to a lot of Glenavon games and became something of a lucky charm as we never lost a game while he was watching. \n\n\"I used to joke that I would send a car to bring him to the matches and bring him back home again. In all the games he saw us, we only drew one game and won the rest.\n\n\"It ended up that Glenavon meant a lot to him and he loved coming to the games. He was at the Irish Cup semi-finals and the finals and he became \u0027one of us\u0027 and he was one hell of a man who loved his sport, loved his family, loved his singing in the choir.\n\n\"The one good thing that has come out of it all in a really positive way is the family has just been told that he has saved two other people\u0027s lives by organ donations.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mobile phone data reveals number of irish border crossings each year","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This equates to less than 1 crossing per person each month or 0.1  trips per week.\n\nThe report shows 40% of the border crossings by NI residents went through the border at Londonderry.  \n\nThis was 34,600 crossings each weekday. Almost 20% of crossings by Northern Ireland residents went through Newry and Mourne , but only 14% of those crossings started there, with residents from other local government districts using that crossing zone as a route to the Republic.\n\nThe report shows that the majority of border crossings start and end in locations in close proximity to the border. \n\nBetween 80% and 88% of border crossings to the Republic by NI residents started in the border areas, while between 75% and 86% of all crossings by Irish residents to Northern Ireland end in border areas.\n\nSome 38% of border crossings by Northern Ireland residents on the average weekday and 26% on the average weekend day are estimated to be work-related. \n\nTherefore 62% of crossing during the week and 74% at the weekend are for social and leisure purposes. \n\nThis means that 65% of crossings over a full week are for social and leisure purposes.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 250 northern ireland people aged over 100 and 37000 aged","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I know many Jewish people who are very happy with Corbyn’s leadership and obviously I hear about other Jewish people who are not. \n\n“I would suspect that he would have met with Jeremy, as I have met with Jeremy, and seen that you get a very dferent impression of this from the media than is happening when you talk with John McDonnell or Jeremy Corbyn who, to my mind, are the furthest away from people who would be involved in any anti-Semitic-type thinking. \n\n“They fought all their lives for the justice of all people and against fascism and against tyranny.”\n\nMr Pinter was a notable critic of the Iraq war, which he described as “a bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of international law”.\n\nHe also hit out at Tony Blair when Nato bombed Serbia and later called the former prime minister a “deluded idiot” and US President George Bush a “mass murderer”.\n\nHe published a collection, War, in 2003, which expressed his opposition to the Iraq conflict.\n\nIn his Nobel speech two years later, by which time he was struggling with cancer, he again lashed out at the case for the invasion, saying: “Political language, as used by politicians, does not venture into any of this territory since the majority of politicians, on the evidence available to us, are interested not in truth but in power and in the maintenance of that power. \n\n“To maintain that power it is essential that people remain in ignorance, that they live in ignorance of the truth, even the truth of their own lives. \n\n“What surrounds us therefore is a vast tapestry of lies, upon which we feed.”\n\nMr Pinter died in 2008, aged 78.\n\nSome of the proceeds from Sir Mark’s performances will go to the Stop the War Coalition, which Mr Corbyn formerly led.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tory conference app security flaws revealed on twitter","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It’s absolute chaos, and it’s sure to be a big winner among gamers.\n\nBut how did the pros get on? Thankfully, a bunch of them have already given it a whirl.\n\nTottenham\n\n\nHarry Kane, Fernando Llorente, Moussa Dembele and Davinson Sanchez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo v two might be the perfect way to play this version of the game, and despite Fernando Llorente having to ask Harry Kane which buttons did what just after kick-off, he and the England striker were able to dominate.\n\nMousa Dembele claimed he couldn’t get used to the anarchic rules in a game which was dominated by attempted fouls and plenty of “successful” offsides, and it showed in the final score.\n\nA resounding 4-0 win in the end for Kane and Llorente was the result. Let’s hope they remember to play by the rules when they get back to Premier League business.\n\nEverton\n\n\nTom Davies, Kieran Dowell, Jonjoe Kenny and Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot more leg on show here, and why not? Tom Davies and Dominic Calvert-Lewin paired up to play Kieran Dowell and Jonjoe Kenny, and the game did not disappoint.\n\nDCL appeared to be the first to master the conditions, telling Davies: “I’m off Dav, just ping it in behind” before scoring from an offside position.\n\nOther highlights include one of the greatest runs of all time from Jordan Pickford, as well as a cracking effort from Idrissa Gueye before the game ended 2-1 to DCL and Davies.\n\nManchester City\n\n\nKevin De Bruyne and ChrisMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, it’s Kevin De Bruyne playing Fa 19 in a suit against YouTuber ChrisMD.\n\nDe Bruyne’s initial thoughts were that “It’s very weird” to play without rules, but he soon got the hang of it, winning 2-1 with a last-minute header from Edinson Cavani.\n\nDe Bruyne also opined that “No Rules” Fa should do away with throw-ins also, so look out for that in Fa 20.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch wouldbe burglar gets shock of his life when he realises hes on camera","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

cinema","story":"\nConcerns have been raised over ambulance cover in the city after a woman who collapsed at a Derry cinema was forced to wait two hours for an ambulance to arrive.\n\nThe incident happened at the Brunswick Moviebowl in the Pennyburn Industrial Estate on Saturday, September 21.\n\nEamonn McLaughlin, Manager of the cinema at Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn, said that an ambulance took a full two hours after a female customer became ill and collapsed before 4pm. \n\nIt was almost 6pm before an ambulance arrived.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, said that when they contacted the emergency services, the operator said they were ‘inundated’.\n\nIt was brought to our attention that a customer was feeling unwell.\n\n“We always have quite a few first aiders on site so the lady was assessed and we decided we needed to ring for an ambulance while the customer was left in a comfortable position with a blanket and pillow.\n“The ambulance was first called at 3.45pm and didn’t arrive until 5.45pm. \n\n“We rang again at about 4.20pm and we were told that they were inundated with calls and they couldn’t tell us how much longer it would take, but that  there were any further concerns to ring back.\n\n“At about 5pm we were quite concerned because she was getting very weak and we wanted to know  we should try to have her gently lted into a car to get her to hospital.”\n\nMr McLaughlin said that after contacting the operator again, they were told that the ambulance was coming from Strabane.\n\n“We wanted to know what the best thing to do was so we rang again at about 5pm and were told that an ambulance was on its way but that it was making its way from Strabane so was still quite a way off,” he added.\n\n“I had discussed it with the telephone operator and with the family and we decided to make the customer comfortable as we didn’t want to move her.”\n\nMr McLaughlin said that he understood that the serious delay was down to the fact the ambulance service was ‘inundated’ with calls and didn’t have the resources to cope.\n\nHowever, he said he was happy that the woman was recovering well and that it had not been more serious.\n“Thankfully, she is doing well,” he said.\n\n“But  it had been more serious, it could have been a very dferent story.”\n\n\nDeteriorating position \n\n\nA spokesperson Northern Ireland Ambulance Service  confirmed that they received a call at 3.46pm last Saturday and, based on the information given, ‘the call was determined to be Category C, neither serious, nor immediately le-threatening’.\n\nThe spokesperson said that the call was referred to the Clinical Support Desk  Paramedic based in the Emergency Control Room, which ed a call at around 4.15pm to establish further details and advice was given  the patient’s condition deteriorated to call 999 again.\n\n“An ambulance had already been despatched by 5.04pm when a further 999 call was made at 5.16pm relating the deterioration of the patient’s condition and the call was upgraded to Category A, potentially serious or le-threatening,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“The ambulance then arrived at the scene at 5.44pm and the patient was assessed, treated and discharged at the scene.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot =

in demand\n\n\nThe NIAS spokesperson apologised for the wait and said that, in the last five years, there has been an increase in demand for ambulances with calls going up by almost 50 per cent.\n\n“NIAS would like to apologise for any discomfort and distress caused to the patient during her wait for the arrival of an ambulance,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“There has been an increase in ambulance response times over recent years and the main reason for this is the year on year increase in demand for our service.”\n\n“The number of calls to the Ambulance Service has increased from 150,093 in 2012/13, to 220,090 in 2017/18, an increase of 46 per cent.”\n\nThe NIAS spokesperson said that there has been a system in place to respond to the most serious cases first and urged the public to engage in a public consultation on the new model, was launched on Thursday.\n\n“In order to address this deteriorating position, NIAS has undertaken a detailed demand and capacity analysis which has established the level of additional capacity required to meet demand within the target timescales, and is developing proposals for a new clinical response model to provide the most urgent response to the most clinically urgent patients,” she said.\n\n“This proposed new model is based on similar models introduced elsewhere in the UK which have proved effective and indicate improved patient outcomes. \n\n“A public consultation on this proposed new model will be launched today and will be available on our website \nwww.nias.hscni.net\n. \n\n“NIAS would encourage all stakeholders to engage during the consultation process.”\n\n\nHeroes\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Foyle MLA and SDLP Health spokesperson Mark H Durkan, said that he had spoken to the Chair of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service with regard to shortages in the emergency service.\n\n“I recently met with the newly appointed Chair of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, Nicole Lappin, to highlight my concerns about the shortage and lack of cover in the North West area, which she accepted the merit of,” he said.\n\n“She outlined her desire to transform the service and make it fit for purpose. \n\n“The problems aren’t to do with the state of the fleet it is actually the shortage of human resources available.” \n\nHe added: “There are just not enough people in the job and I do not think the people doing the job have adequate support.\n\n“In fact, it is usually people who work on ambulances who share their concerns with me about the state of affairs that prevents them from doing their job and getting to people on time.\n\n“This is no reflection on the staff, they are absolute heroes but at times they are covering distances from Limavady to Omagh, leaving only one ambulance in this area.”\n\n\nPictured above: Brunswick Moviebowl where a woman who collapsed last Saturday had to wait two hours for an ambulance to arrive. \n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"beef jerky treats for wales

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers.

Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has labelled the behaviour of Lord Melchett as \u0026ldquodisgraceful and called for immediate action.\n\nThe furore centres around a five year-old girl whose father wants her to attend a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan. However, because she lives in the country outside Castlewellan she would need to have school minibus transport provided for her.\n\nAccording to Mrs Smyth, she has been told by the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the child will have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe child\u0026rsquos father wants her to go to a controlled school and he is entitled to have her do so, Mrs Smyth said. \u0026ldquoI am thoroughly disgusted and I think that the Department of Education must be totally inefficient  they don\u0026rsquot answer within a month.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash There just seems to be no stopping the Downpatrick supergroup Rosetta Stone, who recently completed another dynamic tour of Japan and will be setting off on a trip to Thailand later this year.\n\nThe five members of the group \u0026mdash Damien, Terry and Colin McKee, Andy LeGear and Ian Mitchell \u0026mdash are just back from their second conquering trip to Japan where their latest hit, Sheila, is currently number one.\n\nIn the last year the band have been playing constantly across the globe and have built up a huge following in many countries, including Germany and Canada. But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working. When he arrived back at the vehicle an ignition key and a boot key had ben taken.\n\nPolice in Strangford have since been informed that a children\u0026rsquos sponsored walk was passing through the area at the time and they have appealed to parents to ask the children who took part  they know anything about the theft.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash A burning interest in art has led Newcastle couple Margaret and Gerry Grant into an unusual project \u0026mdash the opening of a new art gallery in their own home.\n\nWith over 200 paintings and sculptures of their own they have opened the gallery in an extension to their Bryansford Road house.\n\nBut it isn\u0026rsquot only for the fun of it. The Grants will be buying and selling works and promoting exhibitions. Already they have lined up an autumn show with exhibits from a Spanish painter and an Italian sculptor.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are aiming at the professional rather than the amateur, Mrs Grant said. \u0026ldquoOur main aim is to share our interest in art, but we do see the commercial and promotional sides to it.\n\n\u0026ldquoReally there is a wide range of work on show. My husband and I have been interested in art for a long time.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash A phantom clothes line thief has struck again \u0026mdash this time in Dundrum. The thief, who has been confining his acts to the Newcastle and Dundrum area, struck during the night at a house on the Dromara Road.\n\nA considerable number of children\u0026rsquos clothes were taken from the line, making it a profitable night for the thief.\n\nPolice in Dundrum and Newcastle are anxious to catch the thief, who must have a considerable wardrobe stocked up by now. Anyone with information or who sees anyone acting suspiciously around houses at night should contact them immediately.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash Plans for a new primary school in Killinchy have brought a \u0026rsquono go\u0026rsquo sign from local residents. In a petition to the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the residents of Ardview Park have expressed serious concern about the plans.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos not the building of the school they object to, but rather the fact that access to the site will be off Ardview Park. They say they are concerned about traffic which will be using the road, both during the construction of the school and when it is opened.\n\nTheir petition was recently shown to members of the Board\u0026rsquos Finance Committee. Afterwards it was agreed to set up a special sub-committee to visit the school and report back on the plans.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash A Ballygowan housewe will be one of eight ladies who will be taking part in the national finals of the Cook of the Realm contest.

The top prize is valued at more than \u0026pound4,000.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Ardglass boxer Ray Ross has been offered a wonderful chance to make an impact on the British lightweight scene.\n\nEvery since he lost a close decision to Charlie Nash for the Irish title two years ago, the 28 year-old slugger has shown indferent form. But now the Ardglass golf course greenskeeper has a chance to make the top before he runs out of fight time and interest.\n\nRoss has been matched with the experienced Jonnie Elliott, of Bournemouth, over eight rounds at Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast on October 11 and a win would hoist Ross up the lightweight ladder and on to bigger punch for paydays.\n\nRay is part of a big British title fight night involving Antrim southpaw Jim Montague against Clinton McKenzie for the vacant light welterweight title.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Kilclief in full flow as ‘Fin are bottled up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA RESILIENT Kilclief outfit produced a rousing second half display to shatter Aughlisnafin\u0026rsquos championship dreams at St Colman\u0026rsquos Park, Drumaness, on Saturday.\n\nDespite going into the break only 0-6 to 0-4 down, Kilclief were staring down the barrel of an ignoble defeat after losing the influential Louis McMullan and James McGrath to early black cards.\n\nTo make matters even worse, they also lost the talismanic Ciaran Sloan to a hamstring injury and almost down to the bare bones, they looked vulnerable and there for the taking.\n\nHowever, led brilliantly by Aiden McCann and Eoin King they took the game to Aughlisnafin with a swagger and sparkle that Willie Megoran\u0026rsquos side were unable to contain.\n\nAughlisnafin were impressively out of the traps first.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.\n\nA Force 8 gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some 90 minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasn\u0026rsquot.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at 6pm, ing home one hour later.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\n\nSome of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekend\u0026rsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellan\u0026rsquos Lower Square for generations.\n\nSlieve Croob councillor Ro\u0026iacutes\u0026iacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the town\u0026rsquos permanent Christmas tree.\n\n\u0026ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8731678.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

KULA on the tale of an Ulsterman caught in a deadly international stand-off \u0026#8211 and the quest to find his missing medal\n\n                \nThe long-lost war medal won by a Belfast sailor during an extraordinary naval escapade is to go on public display for the first time after his son hunted across the world to reclaim it.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n

Incident, during which UK forces came under attack by Chinese communists in the midst of that country’s intense civil war – an encounter which threatened to erupt into a full-scale battle between the two powers. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe international incident saw the vessel HMS Amethyst fired upon and virtually sunk, and then held captive, before going on to launch a brazen escape.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nSamuel Bannister was among those to live through it, and was decorated for his service.\n\nNow his son Andy says this medal is to go on display in HMS Caroline next year  to co-incide with the 70th anniversary of the incident, after he spent years tracking it and bringing it home.\n\n\n   \n                  on the left, grandmother of Andy

Andy had that medal and two others valued on an edition of the Antiques Roadshow, broadcast on September 23. \n\nHere he reveals in detail his family’s role in the 1949 escapade, and the quest to find the medal.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\nFROM ‘ACTOR’ TO WAR HERO:\n\nWhen he was a child growing up in east Belfast, Andy never knew his father Samuel to talk about what he went through in China.\n\nHe recalls how, aged about eight years old, the war movie ‘Yangtze Incident’ came on the TV.\n\n“People would say: Your dad’s film is on”, said Andy, who is now 51 and living in Lisburn.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I assumed my dad had been an actor.\n\n“It wasn’t until later in le I realised he had been involved in this, and it was part of his le.”\n\nSamuel – whose own father fought in WWI and WII, dying at Dunkirk – had been a stoker in the engine room of the HMS Amethyst.\n\nAs it was sailing along the River Yangtze on April 20, 1949, on its way to guard a British embassy building, it was hit by Communist artillery fire.\n\nIt took heavy casualties – many of them fatal – and Samuel was struck in the chest with shrapnel while working below deck.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWhen the call came to evacuate the ship, Samuel made it overboard and then ashore along with an English sailor friend, Keith ‘Boy’ Martin.\n\nSamuel was taken to a primitive village hospital alongside his friend, and was operated on without anaesthetic. He was then 21.\n\n“In the film it actually shows the actor who plays him [Ian Bannen] biting on a rag,” said Andy.\n\n“It’s actually quite a big part of the film, because my dad and ‘Boy’ Martin became political pawns for the Chinese.\n\n“They tried to get them to sign statements saying the Royal Navy had opened fire first – but they wouldn’t do it.\n\n“He’s a young fella, coming from Belfast. The next thing you’re being held captive by Chinese communists. It must’ve been very traumatic.”\n\nThe pair were eventually ed to the ship – only to find it had been essentially impounded with the surviving crew still onboard.\n\nAbout three months after the initial incident, Amethyst – by then able to float once again - tried to escape its captivity.\n\nUnder cover of darkness it set out down the Yangtse – but was spotted, and had to run a gauntlet of shells as artillery guns on the banks opened fire.\n\nAfter over 100 miles the ship made it to the open sea and freedom - with King George himself offering “hearty congratulations on their daring exploit”.\n\n\nHARD TIMES LED TO MEDAL SALE:\n\nSamuel later went on to fight in the Korean War too.\n\nUpon ing to civilian le in Northern Ireland he worked at engine-maker Rolls Royce in Dundonald. He died in 1996 aged 69 of bowel cancer.\n\nSamuel had been awarded medals both for the Yangtse Incident and Korean campaign, but at some point in his le had been forced to sell them to raise funds to look after his we and four children.\n\nAndy said “it had always been my boyhood dream to try and get these medals back”.\n\nHowever, the person who had bought them was not known.\n\n“Everybody I asked about it, dferent collectors, said: You’ve no chance of getting them,” said Andy.\n\n“But when the internet first arrived, it became a lot easier to search.\n\n“And after years of searching the net I finally came across Dixons, an auctioneer in London, which had sold the medals.”\n\nIt turns out they had changed hands a number of times.\n\n“I was able to make about 100 phonecalls - a guy, who knew a guy, who knew a collector - and I got word they had tracked them to a collector in Asia.”\n\nThere were three medals in all - the Yangtze medal, plus a UK Korean War medal and a UN Korean War medal.\n\nThe collector - knowing a family member was seeking them – demanded £10,000.\n\nAndy paid up, plus another £500 for the intermediary who found them.\n\nWhen he appeared on the Antiques Roadshow on Sunday, their estimated value was put at £6,000 to £9,000.\n\nAndy said he had been “held to ransom” over the price, but has no regrets.\n\n“HMS Caroline are going to have a Yangtze Incident display next year. They will display the medals at that,” he said.\n\n“I’m delighted. That’s the reason I contacted the Antiques Roadshow – just to keep the story alive.”\n\nTHREE GENERATIONS CONNECTED:\n\nDuring the course of Andy’s research, he uncovered another Ulsterman who shared the ship with his father.\n\nHe came across a man called Raymond McCullough whose believed his own Belfast father  was on the Amethyst too.\n\nThey met on an online forum, and swapped stories.\n\nAndy was able to find pictures of the Raymond Senior and Samuel together, confirming they had indeed both served on the ship.\n\nBut what was even more surprising was a picture Andy came across in a scrap book it showed two women standing together at the docks, waiting for their sons to come off the Amethyst.\n\nIt turned out the ladies were Andy and Raymond’s grandmothers.\n\n“When I rang Raymond and told him, he had goosebumps all over his arms,” said Andy.\n\n“Our grandmothers had met, then our fathers – and now us.”\n\nRaymond Senior has since died, but his medals too have recently come to light.\n\nThese are likewise now set to go on display in HMS Caroline.\n\nAndy believes that there were as many as seven men from dferent parts of the island of Ireland on the Amethyst at the time of the incident.\n\nIdeally, what he would really like is “a permanent memorial to Amethyst – to all the guys who came from here who were involved in the Yangtze Incident. I think that’d be fantastic.”\n\nHe asked anyone whose relative was on the ship , to get in touch with him at sammysmedals@gmail\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n

for 15 years has admitted that his party broke the law in appointing party members to lucrative special adviser posts.\n\n                \nIn a bluntly vivid picture of Stormont which was a long way from the glossy spin which the DUP and Sinn Féin put on their administration at the time, Timothy Johnston, who is now the DUP’s chief executive, set that unlawful activity in the context of a culture whereby he said both parties routinely broke the rules in Stormont.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDuring a strikingly assured appearance before the RHI Inquiry – the first time the DUP’s key backroom figure has been interviewed in public – he also alleged that Sinn Féin broke at least the spirit of the law which barred them from appointing members with serious criminal convictions as Spads.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Johnston, who before becoming a Spad was the DUP’s chief spin doctor, also did a signicant U-turn in his evidence.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn written evidence to the inquiry, Mr Johnston had said “I had no sense that there was an understood or recognised hierarchy of advisers”.\n\nHowever, after evidence from multiple witnesses – including DUP colleagues – that there was a de facto hierarchy with Mr Johnston either in a very senior position or “at the top of the tree”, he accepted that he was more powerful than many of his colleagues.\n\nHowever, the 40-year-old insisted that he was not as powerful as his portrayal in the media would suggest.\n\nMr Johnston’s evidence brought to an end a bruising week for the DUP at the RHI Inquiry where many of its senior figures have revealed far more about how the party really operates than they would have wanted the public to know.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDocumentation which the inquiry ordered senior DUP figures to hand over reveals internal feuding, suspicion and distrust.\n\nMr Johnston will  to give further evidence later in October and the inquiry will hear from at least one other senior DUP figure, Simon Hamilton.\n\nThe inquiry has heard evidence that many times when DUP ministers appointed Spads they signed false letters in which they claimed that they had examined a “pool of candidates” and chosen their Spad because they were “by far the best”.\n\nIn fact, they rarely appear to have looked at more than one candidate and on many occasions were simply allocated their Spad by the party leadership.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThat is in breach of the Civil Service  Act  2013, which stipulates that all Spad appointments “shall be subject to the terms of the code”, a document which set out a series of processes which must involve the minister.\n\nHowever, despite admissions from senior DUP figures – including leader Arlene Foster – that the party’s actions were contrary that law, there is unlikely to be any sanction as there are now no Spads in post whose appointments can be legally challenged.\n\nMr Johnston yesterday faced detailed questioning about the issue.\n\nHe said he believed that the false letters signed by DUP ministers had likely been a “tick-box exercise”.\n\nHe said he never recalled seeing such a letter for other Spads. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said: “I presume you have seen one or two now?”\n\nMr Johnston said: “Well I’m aware from what has been read at the inquiry...” \n\nSir Patrick said: “Mr Johnston, you are and have been a Spad to the first minister for a number of years...I’m assuming from that that you understand the importance of the matters into which this inquiry is enquiring.\n\n“Now, I ask you again. I assume that you will have seen copies of these letters now?”\n\nMr Johnston said that he had not.\n\nSir Patrick later asked him: “Why was it necessary to ignore the act and the code? Was it because there was a great drive to centralise power in this party?”\n\nMr Johnston said: “I think, chairman, there certainly was an element of centralisation, yes.”\n\nThen, in an apparent allusion to Sinn Féin and other parties, he said: “I think there was a sense of trying to mirror what was a very centralised operation for a number of the parties.”\n\nHe said the work Spads were required to do was “so dficult” that it meant there was a need for the inidual to be drawn from the party and within the party there was a very limited pool of suitable people.\n\nSir Patrick said there was no real argument about the idea that Spads are a necessary and very useful part of democratic government but he queried “how does it come about that an ordinary person in the street - the person in Northern Ireland - whose governed by this arrangement, looking to see how a Spad is chosen, finds an act in 2013 which provides a clear and detailed mandatory code as to how Spads are chosen.\n\n“That person, faced with the reality of your party - and it may well be other parties - would have no understanding of why you didn’t comply with the code, of why you didn’t amend the act.\n\n“You’ve got two processes here – you’ve got an official, democratically-elected Assembly that passes an act and a mandatory code. But in reality you have a very centralised power structure which allocates Spads to ministers, which involves the first minister, which involves – as you’ve told us now – advice or guidance or information from the first minister’s Spads.\n\n“Neither the first minister nor any other Spad is referred to in the code or has a role in the code. So you have two utterly orced structures – one of which is adhered to, the other of which is the official one that anybody will see  they look it up...that is not adhered to. That cannot be a satisfactory situation from a democratic point of view.”\n\nMr Johnston said: “I accept from a transparency point of view, from a democratic point of view...”\n\nSir Patrick said: “Not just transparency, but you have a provision that sets out what you should be doing to democratically reflect the will of the Northern Ireland people - and you’re not doing that quite the reverse.”\n\nMr Johnston said: “No, I accept that, I think, as time went on, things become very comfortable in the sense of how our party and other parties appointed these positions...”\n\nSir Patrick interjected: “I’m not saying other parties – that may well be – but we’re concerned, as you know, with a particular sequence of events.”\n\nMr Johnston said he did not think very much time was spent after an election in studying how Spads would be appointed – and said that that included by the Civil Service, who had a role in ensuring the rules were followed.\n\nHe added: “I just simply make the point that by 2016 the political reality of what was happening was as I have described to you, counsel, and I have to take it as exactly as you say...[we] didn’t get focused on the mandatory nature of the code, and I think where we ended up was a process that probably worked for the output of the system but didn’t comply with the letter and the spirit of what had been passed [into law].”\n\nMr Johnston said it was his view that “we would be better...either sticking to what the law is,  the law works – and  the law doesn’t work, then you look at something else and be honest about it and say ‘[Stormont] could learn some lessons from other legislatures...up to a point, because ultimately in the nature of the mandatory coalition and in the nature of the parties that make up that mandatory coalition and maybe where they’ve come from and where they’re at now even in terms of their development I think it may not always be possible to be as pure as what is done in other places.”\n\nSir Patrick said that the “real problem here” is that “you’re ignoring what the Assembly has passed you’re building a very powerful centralised structure – and it is not in the least surprising, I think you’ll understand, that Spads involved in that structure will look to the central power holders, rather than to the minister, which is completely contrary to the code.”\n\nMr Johnston said: “I accept that”, and went on to say that “there were many things passed by the Assembly which didn’t always sit easy with the wider Executive and maybe sometimes were even ignored”.\n            \n    \n    try

circumvented a high profile law which meant that those with serious criminal convictions could not act as Stormont special advisers \u0026#8211 and top civil servants knew of the situation, Timothy Johnston has said.\n\n                \nIn evidence to the public inquiry into the RHI scandal, the DUP chief executive spoke in illuminating detail about his decade at the heart of power in Stormont Castle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFreely admitting that neither the DUP nor Sinn Féin wanted transparency around how they operated, Mr Johnston said: “We didn’t always want the public to see the elements of the sausage machine because it wasn’t always pretty.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInquiry chairman Sir Patrick said drily: “It’s not.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMr Johnston outlined how Sinn Féin “effectively had people acting as special advisers but not in the proper  of a special adviser role”.\n\nThat happened after the passage of Jim Allister’s Spad bill into law.\n\nMr Allister’s legislation – tabled in response to public anger at the appointment of Mary McArdle, convicted of the murder of Mary Travers as she left Mass with her family – barred those with serious criminal convictions from operating as Spads.\n\nHowever, the inquiry has uncovered documentary evidence that Sinn Féin appears to have side-stepped that by putting some of those with criminal convictions in a role which oversaw the special advisers.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nYesterday Mr Johnston expanded on the material which the inquiry had compelled Sinn Féin, the civil service and others to release.\n\nHe said that the situation was “known to senior civil servants”.\n\nSir Patrick asked why no one had raised the fact that Sinn Féin’s Spads were “being supervised by someone who can’t be a Spad because of the provisions of the act”.\n\nMr Johnston said: “I certainly recall raising it with the head of the civil service and I know others did.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, in a glimpse of Mr Johnston as an arch-pragmatist within the DUP, he said that “realpolitik” meant that “you weigh up in your mind ‘am I going to get a productive outcome by this type of approach, and by dealing with the people where the power lay, or am I better making a theological point about it’, and the likelihood was that it wasn’t going to change...most of what we did for many, many years was just pure, raw negotiation between two parties who were in the government but the line between what was a party negotiation and what was a government negotiation - I’m not sure that it was ever anything than blurred.”\n\nHe said that Executive business was resolved between the DUP and Sinn Féin “often to the exclusion of other parties who were also in the Executive”.\n\nMr Johnston said he could appreciate how  the man in the street was to come to Stormont “they’d probably head back out the door very quickly in great despair, as many of us who were in the system did many times”.\n\nHe said that he “was not saying that the end justied the means” but that often the process led to good outcomes for the public “and you weighed that with a greater weight in the balance than maybe the ugliness of how you got there”.\n\nSir Patrick said the inquiry understood the context of a mandatory coalition, but that there was a need to look at how it could be that politicians and civil servants exchanged letters which they knew not to be true.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try
