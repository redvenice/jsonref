He worked for ClwydAlyn Housing Association and Julie\u0027s house is a ClwydAlyn property.\u0027When she stopped answering the calls and ignoring the texts, her ex-husband took the harassment up a level, taking to following her.         Despite being jailed for 14 months, Carless was released on 5th April, just over three months into his sentence, leaving Ms Miles living in fear of bumping into her obsessed exShe said: \u0027I didn\u0027t really think he\u0027d just give up, but soon after I\u0027d blocked the calls, I saw him out and about.\u0027Julie and I would drive to Tesco and turn the corner from her road in the car and suddenly he\u0027d be there. He followed behind us and I was paranoid the whole time, looking over my shoulder for him.\u0027Starting to grow more concerned with Carless\u0027s behaviour, Ms Miles changed her number and bought a pay as you go sim card.But she was stunned to find he had locked her out of her email account the next day - and to verify the account she needed to input her new phone number.\u0027It meant that he had a number to reach me on, and the endless \u0027no caller ID\u0027 calls started up again straight away - and the WhatsApp verification codes,\u0027 she said.\u0027I called Microsoft and explained the situation, wanting to remove him from my account, but there wasn\u0027t much they could do.\u0027         The tracker in its box after it arrived in the post from AmazonOn Facebook, messages she had never read appeared opened, and she realised he had access to the majority of her accounts.Her brother Andy, 42, was acting as mediator so she didn\u0027t have to directly talk to Carless for updates on their son, but when he asked for her to come and iron his school uniform she decided to go - and record their conversation.\u0027He was so convincing when he denied what he\u0027d been doing that I half thought I was going mad,\u0027 Ms Miles said.\u0027He denied everything when I confronted him, but I later played it to friends and they could tell he was lying.\u0027Carless soon started sending her letters - all begging her not to give up on their marriage, and continuing to guilt her over her son.Wanting advice on how to handle the situation, she called the police and they issued him with a warning - but it made little difference.She said: \u0027He was still showing up at Julie\u0027s house, even when I wasn\u0027t there. Her neighbour came over a couple of times to let us know a man had been hanging around outside.\u0027On 25th November, she received an alert on her phone from Amazon, notifying her that an order for a GPS vehicle tracker was out for delivery.\u0027I took a screenshot straight away - I just knew he would put it on my car,\u0027 Ms Miles said. \u0027He\u0027d had access to it before when I\u0027d gone around to iron, as he\u0027d always offer to charge my electric car up.\u0027Wanting to catch Carless in the act, she allowed him to charge her car, a Mini Countryman, outside the house as usual when she went to see their son that evening.\u0027Andy went outside with him as I hadn\u0027t been able to fill him in, so that must have scuppered his plan to put the tracker on,\u0027 Ms Miles explained.\u0027I was alone in Jane\u0027s house a few days later when I started getting explicit pictures and sexual messages on WhatsApp. \u0027I responded to say if they didn\u0027t stop I\u0027d be in touch with the police - obviously I knew it was Stuart.\u0027She decided to file for orce and went to her old house to get their marriage certificate, but found a far more sinister item.Inside a drawer was an empty SIM card packet - matching the number that had been harassing her on Whatsapp.She nervously decided to check her car, and got down on her hands and knees to see if she could spot anything.\u0027I thought I could see something but even when I took a photo it wasn\u0027t clear,\u0027 she explained. \u0027It looked a bit like the picture of the Amazon tracker, but Andy and I decided we needed to be 100 per cent sure.\u0027Ms Miles took her car to a local garage and, this time, they were able to take a clear picture.A CID officer happened to be passing by when they found the tracker and advised she remove it.She explained: \u0027He told me that whoever had installed the tracker would know I was at a garage and they could come and remove it themselves - which would be evidence lost.\u0027We removed it with gloves and put it in a sealed envelope in the glove box of my car.\u0027As she was driving home, Ms Miles was startled to catch sight of Carless running across the road, and knew he\u0027d been following her.\u0027My friend, Rachel, from work had been handing sick notes in for me, so I arranged to meet her and her husband as normal.\u0027We met in a car park and I explained what was happening. Her husband headed home and the minute he left, Carless car came around the corner.\u0027We didn\u0027t see him at first as we walked along the promenade in Kinmel Bay beach, but when we turned to head back we saw him crouched down watching us..\u0027The pair raced back to the car and sped off to Rachel\u0027s house - but, again, Carless followed.They went inside, but a few minutes later a neighbour knocked on the door to say a man was outside looking at Ms Miles\u0027s car.\u0027I called the police and they asked me to come in and make a statement,\u0027 she said. \u0027He continued to call me even while I was at the station.\u0027He asked where I was and I just said I was at my brother\u0027s - but he knew I was lying and said I\u0027d left my car unlocked. He knew exactly where I was.\u0027Carless was arrested that night and warned not to go near or contact his ex-wife - something he almost immediately ignored.She said: \u0027I got a Christmas card a few days later from him with a letter inside. He said he knew it was wrong to get in touch but he was taking a chance.\u0027I called the police again. I felt bad, but I was worried he\u0027d do something to me and didn\u0027t want to take any chances.\u0027He was re-arrested and appeared at Llandudno Magistrates Court for section 4a stalking.\u0027I didn\u0027t know if he\u0027d be released again so I was worried, but I went back home with my son and changed the locks,\u0027 she said.\u0027I\u0027d been supported by an Independent Domestic Violence Advisor, Annie, throughout the process and she called to let me know he\u0027d been remanded.\u0027I just broke down. It was hard to take it all in.Carless appeared at Mold Crown Court in January 2019, pleading guilty to stalking his wife between October and December 2018. He was jailed for 14 months.\u0027I went to court - I wanted to go and hear it all for myself, so I sat in the gallery and didn\u0027t see him,\u0027 she said. \u0027I couldn\u0027t listen to the defence though, it was awful.\u0027They said he didn\u0027t know what he was doing, but he did. Giving my victim impact statement was so hard, because the effect on my life has been massive.       To add insult to injury, Carless is now back in employment with the housing association, who Vicki says have given him a property\u0027I was out of work for six months and my relationship with my son has really suffered.\u0027He\u0027s only 14 and shouldn\u0027t have been used as a pawn in all this, but Stuart wrote to him from prison - he referred to me as that person you live with.\u0027Carless served a quarter of his sentence and was released on Friday 3rd April, and will be on tag until July.\u0027I\u0027m not scared of him, just of the unknown,\u0027 Ms Miles said. \u0027But I do struggle. I have anxiety, I need sleeping tablets, I\u0027m very isolated. Life is very hard.\u0027It was purely coincidental that I got the Amazon notification and met the CID officer - maybe someone is watching over me. If not, I might even be dead by now.\u0027To add insult to injury, Carless is now back in employment with the housing association, who Vicki says have given him a property.She said: \u0027He\u0027s even back employed by ClwydAlyn.

Photograph: iStockMost children starting school nowadays will be 19 or 20 years old when they finish secondary school following an increase in school starting ages, latest figures show.Parents are increasingly waiting until their children turn five before starting primary school since the introduction of the free pre-school year.Other factors include admission policies in over-subscribed schools – which prioritise older children – and a growth in the number of children with learning disabilities.New figures show that while 40 per cent of junior infants were four years old in January 2010, this fell to just 23 per cent in 2018.There is also evidence to show the trend has accelerated, with the recent extension of the early childhood care and education scheme from one to two years.Pre-school schemeChildren may now avail of the free pre-school scheme from the ages of three up to 5½.Under school enrolment laws, children in Ireland may be enrolled at primary school from the age of four years and must start formal education by the age of six.Ireland differs from the majority of European countries, where most children are not admitted to school until they reach six years of age or older.In Nordic countries such as Finland and Sweden, which rank highly for academic achievement and child wellbeing, primary school starts at the age of seven.Early learningMinister for Children and Youth Affairs Dr Katherine Zappone said the Government’s free pre-school programme had transformed early learning for children and had contributed to a rise in the school starting age.She said a new subsidised childcare scheme for younger children, due to begin later this year, will build on this foundation.The free pre-school programme was officially launched a decade ago offering 38 weeks of funded pre-school education. This was doubled in 2018.Since the programme began, more than 800,000 children have availed of it, while more than 5,000 children with disabilities have been supported in more recent years."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881769.1557075953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"students are under so much pressure they re like zombies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTCD students Luke Fehily and Gráinne Sexton. Fehily says the poor implementation of semesterisation in TCD has made life “impossible” for many students. Photograph: Alan BetsonIt’s midnight outside UCD’s James Joyce library and hundreds of bleary-eyed students are trailing out the main door.Some have been here since first thing in the morning in order to grab a coveted seat with a socket to plug in their laptops.“We had a queue of about 200 students this morning, before the doors even opened at 7am,” says Barry Murphy, president of UCD students’ union. “If you don’t get here by 8.45am, you’re just not going to get a study space with a socket.”College authorities have been adding more and more study places each year, but have been struggling to keep up with record levels of demand.While the library is always busy at exam time, demand has been rising right throughout the academic year.Recently, opening hours at the library at peak times were extended from 11pm to midnight.By contrast, demand for the college’s student bar – once a thriving hub right throughout the year – has been falling steadily.“It’s a symptom of the pressure students are under,” says Murphy. “We end up giving students breakfast in the morning, because they’re like zombies.“Students these days,” he says, “are much more career- and employment-focused from the moment they enter college.”Whereas once simply getting to college was considered an achievement it itself, a dramatic increase in the proportion of school-leavers progressing to third level means many feel under greater pressure to succeed.“You have students stressing about only getting 2:1s instead of 1:1s. There’s peer pressure when they see others doing well. There are parental expectations and there’s self-imposed pressure too,” he says.Extracurricular activity also seems to have taken a hit. Events which take place in the evenings, such as debates or large-scale functions, are not getting the numbers they used to.“Students don’t tend to hang out as much in the evenings,” says James Alkayed, chair of UCD’s societies council. “They’re busier with continual assessment or part-time work or commuting.”Instead, much society activity has switched to smaller-scale morning events, such as coffee mornings.Mental health problemsThere are growing signs that pressure on students may be contributing to a rise in stress and mental health problems right across third level.Campus life has changed dramatically over recent years. More students are commuting long distances due to spiralling accommodation costs, while growing numbers are working part-time jobs to help pay for rent or tuition costs.Many clubs and societies report that attendance engagement levels are falling, with students saying they have less time to dedicate to extracurricular activities.By contrast, numbers going to the gym are rising, leading to concerns that many are more isolated and missing out on the vibrant social life that has always been associated with college.Against this backdrop, record numbers of third-level students are seeking counselling for anxiety and related mental health problems.College-based counsellors say numbers seeking therapy or counselling have surged since 2010, from 6,000 students to well over 10,000 in 2017.John Phillips, president of the Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education group, says pressure to succeed in college is just one of a number of factors behind the rise in numbers experiencing anxiety, panic attacks or acute stress.Other triggers can include social media use, relationship break-ups, isolation, long-term effects of family issues and increasing openness around mental health problems.Does he feel there is greater pressure on students now than before?“Hugely so,” says Phillips. “With more third-level students, there’s more competition for what’s out there. There are more going on to do a masters or PhD, which can be very difficult, constantly feeling that you’re never getting to a comfortable place.”Isolation can be a big problem, especially among international students who have paid hefty tuition fees to study here .Many, he says, find the college campus empties out on a Friday and is quiet again until Monday, with little to do in the meantime.The introduction of semesterisation to colleges over the past decade or so was aimed partly at reducing pressure on students.Instead of a make-or-break exam in the summer, the idea was students would fare better with exams at Christmas and summer, along with a greater emphasis on continual assessment throughout the year.All colleges have now adopted this approach. Opinion, however, is ided on whether it has actually relieved stress on students or contributed to greater sense of ongoing pressure.Trinity College Dublin finally broke with its 400-year exam tradition of high-stakes summer exams only by introducing semesterisation this year.However, hundreds of students have signed a petition stating that the changes have resulted in even greater workloads and a steep decline in their participation in societies.Luke Fehily, a third-year nanoscience student, says that while the theory of the changes is laudable, its poor implementation has made life “impossible” for many students.He argues that this has resulted in “widespread stress, with many people feeling far less prepared for assessment than in previous years . . . Many of us now feel our mental health come second to college work.”Gráinne Ní Sheasnáin, a second-year arts student, says she has had to cut down on extracurricular participation in societies to keep up with college work.“My fear is that I’ll come to the end of my degree and say, ‘Yes, I passed my exams and have done well’ – but it will be like the Leaving Cert: what did I really learn?” she says.“Societies offer a social network and valuable skills you may not get a chance to nurture in a degree . . . if students have less time to get involved, how will they know where potential passions separate to their course of study lie?”She also argues that semesterisation has reduced the quality of learning.“Unlike the old system, where students would have weeks to write essays, followed by months to read for exams, the new academic year structure doesn’t allow for the same level of research to be channelled into essay and exam preparation.”Trinity’s outgoing vice-provost Prof Chris Morash acknowledges there have been problems with congestion of assignments towards the end of term.However, he said recently that a mapping exercise was under way to ensure there is more co-ordination in future.Ultimately, he says, the changes will boost the quality of learning and reduce pressure on students with fewer exams.“Under the old system, students were being examined on things in April which they studied back in October . . . Now, students are getting formative feedback. So, semesteriation provides you with a sense of how you’re doing.”Dropout ratesMeanwhile, there is growing concern in some colleges over a cohort of students believed to be among the most at risk: first years.In any given year, close to 6,000 – or 14 per cent – of new entrants drop out of their course.Among some inidual courses – such as advanced certificate or ordinary degrees in institutes of technology – dropout rates climb above 70 per cent.While these dropout rates owe much to a student’s academic ability, concern has been expressed more broadly that pressure is also a key factor.The governing body of Technological University (TU) Dublin – formed from the merger of DIT, IT Blanchardstown and IT Tallaght – has privately expressed concern at the numbers dropping out after January exams, as well as pressures facing first years generally.“Semesterisation appears to have encouraged continuous assessment in addition to exams rather than as an alternative to exams,” governing body members said recently, according to an internal document.Pierre Yimbog, president of the college’s student union, says the pressure for first years can come from all angles.“Many are also juggling part-time jobs. If you’re on a student grant, for instance, it won’t cover your rent,” he says.A spokeswoman for TU Dublin said it had adopted a “framework for first-year student success” to help new students.This includes mentoring from older students, better orientation and early provision of feedback for assignments.Many courses, she said, are now trying to avoid high-stakes exams at Christmas for first years and are putting a greater emphasis on continuous assessment and project work.There is no mistaking, however, that students are coming of age in an environment in stark contrast to that experienced by previous generations.Digitisation, says Trinity’s Morash, also puts students under pressure in new kinds of ways.Whereas once, knowledge was confined to a few library books, nowadays it is easy to feel overwhelmed with the sheer volume of information.“In some ways, they are more confident than we ever were – and, paradoxically, more anxious,” he says.“A generation ago, you were dealing with people who were often the first in their family to go to university. Now, for many, they are the second generation and there is an expectation that they will do well. They face a very different set of expectations.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Department of Public Expenditure unable to confirm if Paschal Donohoe backs its advicePublic service union wants extra hours agreed during financial crisis abolishedMore parents waiting until their children turn five before starting primary schoolSean Byrnes joins thousands who completed marathon, half-marathon and 10km eventsIt can be hard to tell if an email or call is from a legitimate company or a fraudster so you need to keep your wits about you at all timesThe 44-year-old has been found safe and wellCandidate \u0026lsquoconfused\u0026rsquo by party statement after campaigning throughout review processSome Fine Gael sources are privately alarmed by the Taoiseach\u0026rsquos handling of the affairDublin and London hope the ongoing deadlock can be resolved over next three weeksSurvey backs State and developer\u0026rsquos line that a number of the buildings not there at timeAlmost 2,000 candidates expected to contest for 949 seats in 31 city and county councilsMove follows doctors\u0026rsquo concerns about inadvertently breaching 12-week limitAlmost 1,500 retired Defence Forces members march in Cork to call for better payKaiden (9) is one of up to 90 children with autism in Dublin 15 with no school placeParents say their children are being denied the right to appropriate educationNew buildings needed as Four Courts is \u0026lsquobeyond breaking point\u0026rsquo says Frank ClarkeGreens and People Before Profit also make gains in local electionsSinn F\u0026eacutein loses position as largest party in council as SDLP gains seats"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881945.1557087603!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hand trike helps teen wheelchair user finish great limerick run","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Sean Byrnes (14), from Caherconreafy, Co Limerick, completing Sunday’s Great Limerick Run 10km event, with his mother Fiona Byrnes.

File photograph: Getty Images Ministers have been advised formally that the €3 billion National Broadband Plan, due to be approved by the Cabinet tomorrow, does not represent good value for money.In advice circulated to all Ministers in advance of the meeting, the Department of Public Expenditure has said the plan benefits are not justified by the cost. The proposal is to install a high-speed broadband connection to half a million homes and businesses not served by commercial operators. While debate has raged behind closed doors in Government over the broadband plan for months, formal objections raised in the department’s advice – known as “obs” or observations – are highly unusual.Even more unusually, the department was unable to confirm that the Minister, Paschal Donohoe, supports the its position. A spokeswoman repeated Mr Donohoe’s line that he has received much advice and would make his views known when a decision is reached.Asked specifically if he shared the department’s view, the spokeswoman replied that the Cabinet memo was confidential.Senior officials, including secretary general Robert Watt, have been warning in private for months about the plan, which would be the largest contract ever awarded by the State.It is understood they have raised questions about the likely rate of take-up of the service when the fibre optic cables are installed. A low take-up rate would push up the average cost per household to unjustifiable levels, they have warned.Public relations campaignBut Minister for Communications Richard Bruton has been lobbying colleagues in advance of the Cabinet meeting. And there have been signals from the Taoiseach’s office that it would be politically damaging to cancel the project, say sources. Once the plan is approved, the Government will embark on a campaign to “sell” the measure. Ministers will compare it to the rural electrification scheme – which brought electricity to all parts of Ireland between the 1940s and the 1970s – and the introduction of free education.Ministers will also say the scheme is about “equality and fairness and not leaving rural Ireland behind”, say sources.The contract is likely to be signed by the summer’s end if Ministers sanction a deal with the consortium led by Irish American businessman David McCourt as expected.However, Ministers will be told that it is not practical to bring fibre connections to every single premises. And that in a small number of locations – probably about 2 per cent of the total – broadband access will be provided by alternative technologies, most likely 5G.Experts have advised the Department of Communications, however, that wireless 5G technology would not be suitable for any more than a small number of locations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881960.1557089135!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shorter working week could cost government 600m","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe:  has scheduled a series of bilateral meetings with Ministers in an attempt to rein in expenditure and hold departments to their budgets.  Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsPublic servants are to seek a shorter working week and the abolition of extra hours agreed during the financial crisis, in a move the Government estimates would cost more than €600 million.The latest move, to be tabled by the State’s largest public service union, Fórsa, this month, comes amid growing concern in Government about escalating public sector pay costs after Ministers signalled pay concessions at trade union conferences over the Easter period.Under a previous pay agreement, public servants agreed to work a longer week to avoid further pay cuts. The amount of time varied from sector to sector, but in most cases was between two and 2½ hours a week.Now, with pay cuts imposed during the crisis largely reversed, Fórsa wants the extra hours abolished, though the move is certain to be resisted by the Government, sources say.The Government’s position has traditionally been that while pay cuts introduced during the austerity years were temporary, productivity measures, such as the extra hours introduced at the same time, were permanent.Nonetheless, the move by Fórsa will put further pressure on the Government, which is already facing significant pay demands from various groups across the public service in the wake of its settlement with nurses after their recent strike.Control spendingBefore Easter, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe warned his Cabinet colleagues about the need to control spending. He has scheduled a series of bilateral meetings with Ministers in an attempt to rein in expenditure and hold departments to their budgets.The potential costs of shortening the working week for public servants have alarmed officials. In a paper drawn up in 2017, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform estimated that the abolition of the additional hours could cost more than €620 million.In a bulletin to members ahead of a conference of civil servants and local authority staff this week, Fórsa general secretary Kevin Callinan said the longer hours affected mainly those on low and middle incomes and, in particular, women working in the public service.He said continuing on with this requirement for longer hours without additional pay was “not fair”.Mr Callinan said the increased working hours were agreed when the country was experiencing “torrid times”.He said under this deal a further pay cut was imposed on those earning more than €65,000, while other staff saw their working hours lengthen.ReversedMr Callinan said that by January 2018 the Haddington Road pay cut for higher earners had been reversed in full, but the longer working hours for the other groups of public service staff remained in place.“And, however justifiable increased working time may have been during the crisis, it goes against the prevailing grain of efforts to better balance work and family responsibilities.”Mr Callinan said Fórsa conferences of workers in health, local government and the civil service would this month “adopt policies calling for the restoration of the time lost by those on low or middle incomes during the crisis”.“A few years ago, when we were in the eye of the economic storm, I opposed similar conference motions. But I’d struggle to construct a convincing argument against them now, in light of our current economic performance and rapidly developing technological possibilities.”The Department of Public Expenditure paper said that, as part of the Haddington Road accord, civil servants were required to work an additional 2¼ hours net per week gardaí an additional three days a year nurses an additional 1½ hours per week health and social care professionals two hours per week managementclerical workers in the health sector two hours per week, and teachers two to 2½ hours per week."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881931.1557087005!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unions attempt to squeeze government on pay and productivity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Public Expenditure estimates that the abolition of  additional public service hours could cost more than €620m. Photograph: Getty ImagesWith local and European elections imminent and the possibility of a general election on the horizon, public service trade unions are using the opportunity to squeeze the Government on pay and productivity issues.Unions also believe that the Government’s concessions to nurses on foot of their strike earlier this year has given them some additional leverage.Following the economic crash a decade ago public service unions had to accept a series of “concession bargaining” agreements which saw the introduction of pay cuts as well as other changes such as a less favourable pension scheme for those appointed after 2013, reductions in sick leave entitlements and longer working hours without additional pay.The Government, while agreeing over recent years to reverse most of the pay cuts, has resisted strongly any move to water down what it saw as key productivity reforms. However, it is now facing new pressure to roll back some of these reforms as well.A fortnight ago second-level teachers announced a campaign for the restoration of sick leave arrangements which were effectively halved in 2014.Teachers also sought for more recent entrants the same pension benefits as are in place for more longer-serving colleagues.This weekend Fórsa, the largest public service union, seems set to back calls for the rolling back of the longer working hours introduced for many public service staff in 2013.The non-pay changes put in place across the public service have generated significant savings for the State, and official figures suggest it would be extremely costly to eliminate them.The Department of Public Expenditure estimated that the abolition of the additional hours could cost more than €620 million. Cumulative savingsThe department also maintained in recent weeks that the sick leave reforms had generated cumulative savings of €167 million since 2013.In a paper published as part of the official Budget 2018 documentation, it said if the additional hours were to be fully replaced through recruitment, approximately 11,652 whole-time equivalent staff would be required.The Department of Public Expenditure said qualitative evidence from across the public service indicated the additional hours were “integrated into public service delivery, from extended opening hours for hospital clinics and public libraries to the roll-out of the new local enterprise offices and more frequent Garda patrols”.”These services provide real benefits to citizens, and represent a significant structural increase in the productivity of the public services.”The paper said it was the HSE’s view that any return to the working hours undertaken prior to 2013 would “have a severely negative impact on the provisions of services, together with being majorly costly at this time of constraint on public funding”.“The loss of the additional hours available since 2013 would result in serious additional costs, andor reduction in delivery of services. An example of this is that if nursing hours were to return to 37.5 hours per week, the maintenance of the same number of hours in nursing would require the taking on of an additional 1,433 nurses at an average cost of €60k per year. This would potentially cost an additional €88 million alone.” Firm handThe new pressure from unions for a rolling back of productivity and other reforms comes at a time when spending discipline within the Government appears to be loosening , and the Department of Public Expenditure is seeking to regain a firm hand.The  reported in recent days that Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe is to hold bilateral meetings with Ministers over spending issues."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881494.1557072287!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup remains north s largest party but alliance makes big gains","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Alliance Party’s Nuala McAllister celebrates as she is elected for the Castle area during the local  election count at Belfast City Hall. Photograph: Mark MarlowPA The story of the local elections in Northern Ireland was the strong performance of the Alliance party to increase its representation by more than 20 seats.Alliance and the Greens have topped the polls in many areas, picking up additional seats in a number of councils.With all 462 seats filled in 11 councils, the Alliance party is celebrating victories across the six counties seeing its representation jump by 65 per cent.However, the political landscape in Northern Ireland stays much the same as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) remains the North’s largest. It gained 24.1 per cent first preference votes – up by 1 per cent – and ended the election with 122 seats, a loss of eight seats compared to the 2014 council elections.Sinn Féin suffered a slight dent to its support base with 23.2 per cent first preference votes – a drop of 0.8 per cent. The party walked away with 105 council seats, the same number of seats they won in 2014.The Alliance Party saw a surge in its share of votes which increased from 6.7 per cent to 11.5 per cent. Its number of seats rose from 32 to 53.The Green party and independents also made significant gains across the 11 councils. The Green party’s Mal O’Hara was elected to Belfast City Council in what has been a hugely successful election for his party in Northern Ireland’s capital. The party doubled its representation and now has eight seats.The Ulster Unionist Party suffered some of its biggest causalities with the loss of high-profile Belfast councillor Jeff Dudgeon. In a disastrous election for his party in Belfast, Mr Dudgeon was eliminated on the third stage of the count.The party now has 75 council seats, a loss of 13 compared to the last local government elections.The SDLP also lost seven councillors and gained 12 per cent of first preference votes – a drop of 1.6 per cent.The Traditional Unionist Voice suffered a heavy blow to its representation after losing over half of their seats. The party have been left with six seats.Independents made significant gains taking 23 seats. People Before Profit added four councillors to its representation, taking home five seats.In Omagh, a former MP who resigned after angering relatives of 10 Protestants shot dead in a sectarian massacre won a council seat. Barry McElduff was forced to resign his Westminster seat last year amid an outcry after he posted a video of himself balancing a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head.It was posted on his Twitter account on the anniversary of the Kingsmill atrocity, which saw 10 workmen shot dead by republicans in Co Armagh on January 5th, 1976.DUP leader Arlene Foster said she did not believe Mr McElduff has recognised the hurt and pain he caused to victims in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the son of murdered Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane was elected to Belfast City Council.John Finucane was elected on the first count of the Castle district electoral area – which encompasses parts of north Belfast – for Sinn Féin with 1,650 votes, just behind the Alliance party’s Nuala McAllister, who attracted 1,787 votes.In further controversy, Mrs Foster said she will consider comments made by former health minister Jim Wells about the DUP’s first openly gay councillor in Northern Ireland. The leader said her party will look at a number of issues including “bad behaviour” by members after the local elections have concluded.It comes after Mr Wells said his former leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, would have been “aghast” at the decision to run gay DUP candidate Alison Bennington.The DUP’s founder once led a campaign to, in his words, “Save Ulster from Sodomy” and prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality.Mrs Foster said Mr Wells should not have made the comments to the media.MessageAlliance leader Naomi Long said the message from the voters is that “they want to see politics that delivers”.“They are not interested in the kind of tribal politics of the past in terms of unionism and nationalism. What they want is the kind of politics that puts people first,” she told the BBC.Ms Long will be contesting the European Parliament election on May 23rd in Northern Ireland if it goes ahead.In advance of Tuesday’s talks involving the North’s five main parties and the British and Irish governments, that was a comment all the other main parties said was a central theme of canvasses – that voters were urging the parties to reinstate Stormont.A total of 819 candidates stood in the election for 462 seats on 11 councils in Northern Ireland. – Additional reporting: PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881477.1557001705!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ex speaker for dissident republican group gary donnelly tops derry poll","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Gary Donnelly topped the poll for Moor Ward during the Derry and Strabane District local elections. Photograph: Margaret McLaughlin It was a bruising election for Sinn Féin in Derry and Strabane, where the party lost five seats and their position as the largest party on the council.The SDLP gained three seats to put both parties on 11 seats each.In The Moor District Electoral Area (DEA), Gary Donnelly – a sitting Independent councillor and former spokesman for the dissident republican 32 County Sovereignty Movement – topped the poll and was re-elected as an Independent councillor on the first count.There had been speculation that Mr Donnelly’s electoral prospects would be damaged by the murder of 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee by the New IRA in Derry on April 19th.Mr Donnelly said his election was an endorsement of the work he had been carrying out on behalf of his constituents. He refused to answer when asked by The  about the murder of Ms McKee.Smaller partiesThe success of smaller parties across Northern Ireland was paralleled in Derry.Veteran campaigner Eamonn McCann and his party colleague Shaun Harkin gained People Before Profit’s first two seats on Derry City and Strabane District Council (DCSDC).Mr McCann said their election was “part of a clear left-wing advance”.“What the election shows overall is that there is an increasing appetite for alternatives to parties which are colour-coded either orange or green,” he said.Two Alliance candidates were elected to give the party its first electoral representation in Derry in 38 years.Rachael Ferguson, who was elected for Alliance in the Faughan DEA, had been asked to stand by the party leader, Naomi Long, after she messaged her about the lack of a female Alliance candidate in the area.“I only went and done it!”, Ms Ferguson said on social media after her victory. “I cannot believe it!”Dr Anne McCloskey, a retired GP and prominent pro-life campaigner, won a seat on behalf of pro-life republican party Aontú, in what is the party’s first electoral success in the North.“This was a foundational election,” said Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín. “We didn’t exist four months ago, but what we sought to do was to select candidates to build an organisation around and we have done that.”Sinn Féin and SDLPThe SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the party’s success in Derry and Strabane was the start of a “resurgence” which he hoped would see the SDLP retake the Foyle seat at Westminster in the next UK general election.Among the SDLP’s new councillors is Mary Durkan, the niece of former Foyle MP Mark Durkan and sister of MLA Mark H Durkan, who topped the poll in Foyleside with more than 1,200 first preference votes.“It’s early days for us in terms of the renewal project,” Mr Eastwood said, “but what we’re finding across the North is that in places where we run new, young, talented candidates and put a good campaign behind them we can win seats.“We have an awful lot of work to do across the North. There are large parts of the North where we need to put a lot of effort in, but we know what the formula is and we’re going to multiply it.Six sitting Sinn Féin councillors failed to win re-election, including former mayors Kevin Campbell and Maolíosa McHugh.Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney acknowledged that the count had been challenging for the party and he was in no doubt there were “lessons for us to learn”.“When the electorate speak to you, you have to listen,” he said.“We will go away, and we will examine this.“Across the picture the Sinn Féin vote has held up well, and I think it sends a very clear message that the political institutions need to be up again on the right terms.“We have to focus on our own message that we have received here, and that’s what we’ll be doing in the coming days and weeks, and we’ll learn from it and we’ll get strength from it,” he said.With counting now complete in Derry and Strabane, the final tally is Sinn Féin 11, SDLP 11, DUP 7, UUP 2, Alliance 2, People Before Profit 2, Independents 4 and Aontú 1."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881658.1557071453!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland s voters have sent politicians a clear message","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster with Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill at the Lyra McKee funeral in Belfast last month. Photograph: Brian LawlessPAIan Knox had a good cartoon in the Irish News on Saturday. It showed the leaders of the Alliance and Green parties, Naomi Long and Clare Bailey, striding along arm in arm, with Long’s striking flame hair cascading down her back.In the background were an Orangeman and a Catholic cleric looking on, with the former observing: “Politics hasn’t changed at all – it’s still Orange and Green.”Long’s hair is more red than orange, but the gag worked. The big talking point of the local elections in Northern Ireland was the major success of Alliance and, coming from a much lower base, the Greens. Not only has Alliance expanded its power base across Northern Ireland, but the “Alliance surge” has provided great momentum for Long as she embarks on her campaign to win the third seat in the three-seater European Parliament election in Northern Ireland on May 23rd. The DUP and Sinn Féin are shoo-ins for the first two seats, with the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and the Traditional Unionist Voice also in the hunt for the third seat – that is, assuming the election goes ahead. But the cartoon succeeded on another level as well because regardless of the gains by Alliance and the Greens, and also by People Before Profit which jumped from one to five seats, politics in Northern Ireland is “still Orange and Green”.There is some message to be deciphered from Alliance increasing its representation from 32 seats to a whopping 53, and from the Greens rising from four to eight seats. Yet at the end of the day the DUP and Sinn Féin remain the leading parties.Sinn Féin perhaps was taught a little humility in Derry where the SDLP regained some lost ground, although the SDLP will be disappointed to see its overall number of council seats reduce from 66 in 2014 to 59 now. But not half as deflated as the UUP, which dropped from 88 to 75 seats. Disappointment too for Jim Allister’s Traditional Unionist Voice which won six seats compared to 13 in 2014. And Peadar Tóibín can’t be too happy for his Aontú party to take just one seat, in Derry. Overall voteSinn Féin’s share of the overall vote, if slightly down from the 2014 local elections, is a healthy 23.2 per cent. It won 105 seats, the same as five years ago. The DUP increased its vote by one point to 24.1 per cent, although its number of seats dropped from 130 to 122.The easy-to-decode message here is that if there is a deal to be done when the Irish and British governments and the North’s five main parties get around the table from Tuesday on it is that the DUP and Sinn Féin who will be the chief deal-makers. If there are compromises to be struck on issues such as the Irish language and same-sex marriage and whatever else is thrown into the negotiating pot then chiefly it will be for Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds, and Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill to make the hard calls.But equally Foster and McDonald should not miss that the achievement of Alliance in particular involved a significant portion of the electorate making a plea for a move from polarised to a more accommodating form of politics.All the parties, including the DUP and Sinn Féin, acknowledged that on the doorstep, particularly in the wake of the murder of journalist and writer Lyra McKee, the recurrent plea they heard was for politicians to get powersharing back working again and to reinstate the Northern executive and assembly.Dissident republican Gary Donnelly topping the poll in one of the Derry council wards suggests that not everyone was heeding the public revulsion at the actions of the New IRA in murdering McKee, but nonetheless that local result doesn’t negate the larger message. grassrootsThe electorate also seemed to send out a subliminal signal that getting a deal is far from impossible. In February last year, according to numerous sources, the DUP and Sinn Féin under proposed labyrinthine legislation had found a way to address the Irish language issue, although in the end the DUP could not sell it to its grassroots. That could be revisited if the will is there.The election of the DUP’s first openly gay candidate, Alison Bennington, and the decision by Foster and party HQ to stand by her in the face of some internal criticism, appeared to indicate that key matter also might be resolved even if it might take some Jesuitical politicking to get there.After the locals in Northern Ireland a lot has changed and not a lot has changed, yet the hard nudge to the politicians from the voters seems to be to seize this opportunity and get a deal done."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881947.1557087655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"social democrats confirm kisyombe as local election candidate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEllie Kisyombe: ‘I’m delighted to have submitted my nomination forms to the DCC returning officer.’ File photograph: Tom HonanThe . Social Democrats candidate Ellie Kisyombe has said her local election campaign continued throughout the party’s review of her case and she was “confused” by the statement issued by the party afterwards.On Saturday, the party said Ms Kisyombe would proceed as a candidate in Dublin’s north inner city after a review of allegations of inconsistencies in the story of her arrival in Ireland and entry into direct provision. She has been living in direct provision for much of the past decade.An independent review was completed last month following internal isions after The Sunday Times revealed in February that the candidate, originally from Malawi, arrived in Ireland in April 2011 and secured a student visa, before travelling to the UK and claiming asylum there. Ms Kisyombe has claimed she sought asylum immediately after arriving at Dublin Airport.In its statement following the review, the party said: “Following a number of recommendations arising from the review, the candidate has undertaken a series of commitments including revising her campaign literature to properly reflect her history and circumstances. The candidate has also corrected the chronology of her back story to the satisfaction of the National Executive at this time.”On social media, however, Ms Kisyombe said she was “slightly confused by the statement” as her campaign had continued throughout the review.On Twitter and on her Instagram account, Ms Kisyombe said: “I’m delighted to have submitted my nomination forms to the DCC (Dublin City Council) returning officer this morning. It’s great that the review has finally completed. “However, I’m slightly confused by the statement. My campaign continued throughout as the purpose of the review. I want to take this opportunity to thank my lawyer Mr Gary Daly, a man with high integrity! “My campaign manager, my mentor, a good friend, my confidant Gary Gannon councillor and all the members of the party of the entire Social Democrats around the country for standing with me. Lastly, I’m looking forward to May 24th now.”After The Sunday Times article was published, three members of the Social Democrats national executive resigned, including its chairman and deputy chairwoman, Joe O’Connor and Carly Bailey and a third member Chris Bond."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881975.1557090166!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu set to embrace politics of lowest common denominator at sibiu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSibiu’s message would be the legacy project for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersWhen Jean Claude Juncker first mentioned a summit in Sibiu, Romania, back in his state-of-the-union address in 2017, he set a high, ambitious bar for this week’s meeting. \u0026nbspThis, the European Commission president suggested, would be the opportunity for Europe’s leaders to respond in confident, ringing terms to Brexit, to show European voters in the May 23rd elections that the European Union has a vision and a vital future, that it remains the answer to the great challenges the continent faces. That Britain’s departure will not stall the integration engine that drives it. On the contrary...“The duty of every generation is to change the destinies of Europeans for the better. To make good on our enduring promise of peace, progress and prosperity. This has been my vocation and my life’s work,” he reiterates in the commission’s submission to Sibiu, a stirring account of the commission’s last five years’ work and of the EU’s resilience.In effect Sibiu’s message would be the legacy project for Juncker, a fitting farewell for the president who departs at the end of October (with the UK, if the current timeframe holds).Sibiu would have happened after Brexit, but the best laid plans of mice and men have gone awry, postponing the event and turning the scheduled “first summit of the new era” into a less era-defining, more uncertain halting point on the road.Political climateThe political climate has changed too. Although France’s President Emmanuel Macron remains unwaveringly ahead of the pack, committed to an ambitious integration programme, the period has seen a strengthening of voices like those in Hungary and Poland, notably in Italy, which urge the union to hasten slowly. How will the promotion by EU leaders of the idea of accelerating integration play in elections likely to be dominated by populist anti-EU rhetoric? Not well, many fear.And so the draft declaration for Thursday’s meeting, embracing the politics of the lowest common denominator, eschews specifics for warm-sounding, motherhood-and-apple pie platitudes.“There is no place for isions that work against our collective interests. We will stay united, through thick and thin. We will show each other solidarity in times of need and we will always stand together. We can and we will speak with one voice,” the text declares.Brexit is not mentioned in the draft, nor will British prime minister Theresa May be present, but that strong message of unity London will understand as an unmistakable signal that the EU remains in no mood to budge from its commitment to the withdrawal agreement in its entirety.Of course, this is not a proper summit in the legal sense. Only an informal meeting of 27 leaders. So no formal “conclusions”, but a presidency statement from the Romanians summing up the spirit of the meeting in a way that will offend no one.A “non-paper” from European Council president Donald Tusk also sets out the outlines of the EU’s strategic priorities in a similar vein – they will be filled out at the normal June summit when leaders are also expected to nominate a clutch of presidents for its main institutions, including the European Council, commission and European Central Bank. Preliminary informal discussions on nominations will certainly begin in the margins of in Sibiu.Blunt papersIn the hope of moving the discussion on to specifics the Dutch have also submitted five more blunt reflection papers on aspects of the way the EU does its business and which emphasise the need to strengthen exisiting co-ordination mechanisms rather than inventing new ones. Reflecting the country’s emerging role as the key alternative voice to the Franco-German alliance, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar drops off on Wednesday to confer with Mark Rutte on his way to Sibiu.On migration the Dutch paper pulls no punches on the requirements of mutual solidarity with those member states who will not share the burden of accommodating asylum seekers. Hungary and the Visegrad countries are not mentioned specifically, but the target is clear: “Free-riding needs to end,” the paper says. “A lack of implementation of the current and future acquis should lead to negative consequences: financially andor in enjoying privileges resulting from Schengen.” The Romanian declaration simply refers to the need to reform the asylum system.On foreign policy co-ordination the Dutch echo a long-standing Juncker demand for ending unanimity voting on sanctions to allow the union rapidly to be able to use its economic clout in international diplomacy without being hamstrung by a few member states who might be wary of tackling potential targets such as Russia."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Israel carries out air attacks after \u0026lsquomore than 600\u0026rsquo rockets launched against itIsraeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu convenes security councilWomen abducted by terror group can return to Yazidi community but children of Isis fighters barredAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u0026rsquos group has endured many defeats while gaining adherents around worldVideo comes weeks after remnants of group were ousted from last stronghold in SyriaGovernment app Absher allows men to monitor and control female relatives\u0026rsquo travelNorth Korean leader meets Russian counterpart after talks with Donald Trump stallAmnesty condemns Riyadh executions as evidence of \u0026lsquocallous disregard for human life\u0026rsquoAt least 33 of those put to death on Tuesday belonged to kingdom\u0026rsquos Shia minorityChanges that could keep hardline leader in power until 2030 approved in referendumIsraeli leader wishes to \u0026lsquoexpress appreciation\u0026rsquo for recognising sovereignty over regionSaudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi set to benefit from US move to make Tehran capitulateDamascus Letter: The job will be enormous and expensive, and may increase resentmentPresident Rouhani says Iran\u0026rsquos problems are \u0026lsquoZionist regime and American imperialism\u0026rsquoPM must form coalition following unprecedented promise to annex West Bank settlementsUS decision will aid Khalifa Haftar\u0026rsquos attack on UN-recognised government in TripoliEfforts focus on constitutional commission featuring government and opposition groupsPresident could rule until 2030 if reforms backed in upcoming referendumParliament set to pass sweeping constitutional changes that will then be put to referendumBeresheet travelled through space for seven weeks before crossing into moon\u0026rsquos gravity"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881584.1557086432!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"netanyahu massive strikes on gaza militants to continue","story":"Israel has carried out dozens air strikes on targets across the Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants fired more than 250 rockets into Israel. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA picture taken in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip  shows an explosion following an airstrike by Israel. Photograph: AID KHATIBAFPGetty ImagesRockets and missiles from Gaza killed four civilians in Israel, while Israeli strikes killed 19 Palestinians, more than half of them civilians, in surging cross-border fighting on Sunday, according to Gazan officials and the Israeli military.Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said he ordered the military to continue “massive strikes” against Gaza’s ruling Hamas group and Islamic Jihad, in the most serious border clashes since a spate of fighting in November.Israel’s military said more than 600 rockets and other projectiles – over 150 of them intercepted by its Iron Dome anti-missile system – have been fired at southern Israeli cities and villages since Friday.It said it attacked more than 260 targets belonging to Gaza militant groups. Gaza officials said Israeli air strikes and artillery fire killed 27 people including 14 civilians since Friday.A rocket that hit a house in Ashkelon on Sunday killed a 58-year-old man, police said. He was the first such Israeli civilian fatality since the seven-week-long Gaza war in 2014.Another rocket strike killed a factory worker, a hospital official said. The military said a civilian was killed near the border by an anti-tank missile fired at his car from Gaza and a fourth died when a rocket struck the city of Ashdod.In Gaza, militant groups identified eight fighters killed in Israeli strikes, while medical officials said nine civilians also died, including a couple and their baby daughter.In what it said was a separate, targeted attack, Israel’s military killed Hamed Ahmed Al-Khodary, a Hamas commander. The military said he was responsible for transferring funds from Iran to armed factions in Gaza. Hamas confirmed Khodary had been killed.The attack on his car was the first such killing by Israel of a top militant since the war five years ago. Israel had suspended what Palestinians call an assassination policy in a bid to lower tensions.The sounds of sirens and explosions reverberated on both sides of the frontier, fraying nerves and keeping schools closed.Israel halted supplies from its main natural gas field. The Tamar field’s offshore production platform is in range of Palestinian rockets. Israel also stopped fuel imports into Gaza through the main Kerem Shalom crossing.The latest round of violence began two days ago when an Islamic Jihad sniper fired at Israeli troops, wounding two soldiers, according to the Israeli military.Islamic Jihad accused Israel of delaying implementation of previous understandings brokered by Egypt aimed at ending violence and easing blockaded Gaza’s economic hardship.This time, Israeli strategic affairs analysts said, both Islamic Jihad and Hamas militants appeared to believe they had some leverage to press for concessions from Israel, where independence day celebrations begin on Wednesday.In two weeks Israel is also hosting the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, the target of a Gaza rocket attack in March. That attack caused no damage. On Sunday sirens sounded in the city of Rehovot, 17 km (10.5 miles) southeast of Tel Aviv.In a statement announcing that Israel would press on with its attacks, Mr Netanyahu, who doubles as defence minister, also ordered forces around the Gaza Strip to be “stepped up with tanks, artillery and infantry”.RamadanFor residents in Gaza, the escalation comes a day before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins in the territory on Monday. It is traditionally a time for prayer, family feasts to break a daylight fast, and shopping.Among the 14 Gazan civilians killed since Friday were a 14-month-old baby and the baby’s aunt, according to the health ministry. Israel’s military said the intelligence information showed they were killed by a misfired Palestinian rocket.In Gaza, two Palestinian human rights groups described the cause of their deaths as an explosion whose source was still undetermined.Israeli bombings in Gaza destroyed two multi-storey structures. Witnesses said the Israeli military had warned people inside to evacuate the buildings, which it alleged housed Hamas security facilities, before they were hit.Saeed Al-Nakhala, owner of a clothing store in one of the buildings, said he had had no time to save his merchandise.“I was together with my son in the shop, there was a big noise and then another and people started to run. We left everything behind and escaped,” said Mr Nakhala.The Tánaiste and Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney TD today said he unequivocally condemns the “indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza”.Mr Coveney added: “These actions undermine the cause of the Palestinian people. The unjust treatment of Gaza and the suffering of people there will never be solved by violence or terrorist attacks.”The Tánaiste called for an end to the attacks and for “restraint in terms of the Israeli response, which has already led to several deaths in Gaza.”“The international community needs to work with all sides to de-escalate tension, as a matter of urgency.”The United Nations’ mideast envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, said the UN was working with Egypt to restore calm and called on all sides to “de-escalate” and restore recent understandings.“Those who seek to destroy them will bear responsibility for a conflict that will have grave consequences for all,” he said in a statement.A UN envoy said it was working with Egypt to try to end the fighting. Iran condemned what it called Israel’s “savage” attack on Gaza, and blamed “unlimited US support” for Israel.Some two million Palestinians live in Gaza, whose economy has suffered years of Israeli and Egyptian blockades as well as recent foreign aid cuts and sanctions by the Palestinian Authority, Hamas’s West Bank-based rival.Unemployment in Gaza stands at 52 percent, according to the World Bank, and poverty is rampant.Israel says its blockade is necessary to stop weapons reaching Hamas, with which it has fought three wars since the group seized control of Gaza in 2007, two years after Israel withdrew its settlers and troops from the area. – Reuters, PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881599.1557055813!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"let s do a deal theresa may urges labour to agree on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May leaves church in Sonning. Photograph: Simon DawsonReutersBritish prime minister Theresa May on Sunday stepped up calls for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a cross-party deal to leave the European Union, following poor results for both parties in local elections on Thursday.The parties have been in negotiations for over a month to try to broker a Brexit deal that can secure majority support in parliament, after Mrs May’s minority government suffered three heavy defeats on her preferred deal this year and was forced to delay Britain’s departure.“To the leader of the opposition I say this: Let’s listen to what the voters said in the local elections and put our differences aside for a moment. Let’s do a deal,” she wrote in the Mail on Sunday newspaper.Labour responded by saying any deal should be done quickly, but accused Mrs May of leaking details of the compromise under discussion and jeopardising the talks.Mrs May’s Conservatives lost more than a thousand seats on English local councils that were up for re-election, and Labour - which would typically aim to gain hundreds of seats in a mid-term vote - lost 81.The talks with Labour are a last resort for Mrs May, whose party’s deep isions over Brexit have so far stopped her getting approval for an exit agreement and left the world’s fifth largest economy in prolonged political limbo.The Sunday Times reported that the Conservatives would offer new concessions to Labour when talks restart on Tuesday, including a temporary customs union with the EU until a general election due in June 2022.“At that point Labour could use their manifesto to argue for a softer Brexit if they wanted to and a new Conservative prime minister could argue for a harder Brexit,” a source cited by the Sunday Times said.Mr Corbyn has made a permanent customs union with the EU a condition for supporting Mrs May’s Brexit plans, while most Conservatives oppose a customs union as it would stop Britain from reaching its own trade deals with other countries.AngerThe report on the terms of a possible compromise angered MrCorbyn’s senior ally John McDonnell, who oversees the party’s finance policy and has been involved in the Brexit talks.Asked if he trusted Mrs May, Mr McDonnell said: “No, sorry. Not after this weekend when she’s blown the confidentiality... I actually think she’s jeopardised the negotiations for her own personal protection.”Nevertheless, McDonnell said talks would continue this week and if a deal could still be struck, it must be concluded quickly.Even then, the parliamentary approval - required by law - is not straightforward.A customs union would upset the most pro-Brexit members of the Conservative Party who say it does not honour the terms of the country’s 2016 vote to leave the EU.Eurosceptic MP John Redwood tweeted on Sunday that a cross-party agreement that amounted to staying in the bloc was “the last thing we need.”On the other side of the Brexit ide, the Observer newspaper reported that scores of Labour MPs had written to Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to insist on a second Brexit referendum on any deal agreed.Veteran Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, whose new Brexit Party is predicted to make big gains in European Parliament elections this month, said a Conservative-Labour Brexit deal on a customs union would be “a coalition of politicians against the people.”A temporary customs union would also be likely to raise EU concerns that it could lead to customs checks on the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland if it later breaks down - something Ireland objects to strongly. - ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignMichael Gove urges chefs, restaurateurs and hoteliers to help Government end \u0026#39scandal\u0026#39 of food wasteExpectant mothers to be given same

mans unmarked grave traced amateur detective 130 years","story":"The unmarked grave of Joseph Merrick - better known as the Elephant Man - has been traced after nearly 130 yearsThe unmarked grave of Joseph Merrick - better known as the Elephant Man - has been traced after nearly 130 years, according to his biographer.Merrick had a skeletal and soft tissue deformity which saw him as a medical curiosity, with his skeleton preserved at the Royal London Hospital.But author Jo Vigor-Mungovin claimed she has now discovered Merrick\u0027s soft tissue was buried in the City of London Cemetery after he died in 1890 aged 27.After a miserable adolescence in Leicester and time as a travelling exhibit, Merrick ended up at the former London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London.Mrs Vigor-Mungovin, who has written a biography of Merrick, told the BBC that his soft tissue was buried but had not been followed up due to the number of graveyards in use at the time.She said: I was asked about this and off-hand I said \u0027It probably went to the same place as the Ripper victims\u0027, as they died in the same locality.Then I went home and really thought about it and started looking at the records of the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium near Epping Forest, where two Ripper victims are buried.I decided to search in an eight-week window around the time of his death and there, on page two, was Joseph Merrick.Merrick, whose condition did not develop until he was five, has inspired a number of books, alongside an award-winning play and a film starring John Hurt.His head eventually measured 36 inches, with researchers claiming the deformities were the cause of Proteus syndrome, a rare genetic disorder.She added: It gives his residence as London Hospital, his age as 28 - Joseph was actually 27 but his date of birth was often given wrong - and the coroner as Wynne Baxter, who we know conducted Joseph\u0027s inquest.The authorities said a small plaque could be made to mark the spot, which would be lovely.Michael Gove urges chefs, restaurateurs and hoteliers to help Government end \u0026#39scandal\u0026#39 of food wasteExpectant mothers to be given same

That represents an improvement on the previous month in which the sector shrank, recording 48.9.\u0026nbspBut as a recovery it’s about powerful as a broken down lawn mower engine.It’s de rigueur in any discussion\u0026nbspof economic data to provide a point of context. In the case of this one, the last two months represent the weakest performance signalled by this dataset for six years. \u0026nbspCarney, however, said he believed that surveys like this one may be over stating “Brexit uncertainty”. An example of the Bank being infected by the Brexiteer disease that holds that you’re a bally traitor if you display anything other than mindless optimism about their crazy project?\u0026nbspThat’s pushing it. Carney merely thinks investors are being too dovish and that even a modest improvement in the UK’s outlook would require remedial action from the central bank. Anything above 1.5 per cent - which would hardly put the UK in the class of the Jaguar cars that won’t be being made here for much longer - would do it. \u0026nbspThis, he thinks, is a realistic prospect if the Brexit impasse is finally resolved. He\u0026nbspalso appears to be ruling out a no deal.\u0026nbspHe may very well be guilty of underestimating the depths to which the Tory Party is prepared to sink. Perhaps it’s because he most often talks to Philip Hammond, who is on it’s semi sensible wing.Regardless, savers shouldn\u0027t get too excited about an improvement on the dismal returns they\u0027re currently getting.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, tweeted a couple of important points upon their release. He produced a graph showing that the official GDP data has erged somewhat from the PMI recently, which does happen every now and again.\u0026nbspBut long term they’re quite closely aligned and he noted that it would be “highly unusual for the economy to at least not lose substantial momentum when the PMI has sunk to current levels for more than one month”. The services sector accounts for 80 per cent of the UK\u0027s output, covering everything from City banks to the small dry cleaners where their employees\u0026nbsptake their suits.\u0026nbspThe uncertainty is there. It’s real, and it’s having an impact. And it doesn’t look like it\u0027s\u0026nbspgoing away soon.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the table was a bottle of wine. When they ordered a second, there was an audible ripple of admiration around the room. Fellow diners smiled in their direction.\u0026nbspThis scene unfolded recently in a City restaurant. Indeed, the two men looked as if they had met for a bit of a stockbroker reunion, to reminisce about their share trading, and lunching, days.\u0026nbspHardly anyone has a “two bottler” any more. Not at lunch on a work day. One bottle is rare, but a couple –\u0026nbspthat is going some.\u0026nbspEven a glass of wine is relatively scarce. If I look through my diary of a month’s worth of business lunches, those where the other person had a glass (like many, I no longer drink at lunchtime) amount to just a handful.\u0026nbspIn most workplaces today, drinking during working hours is frowned upon, as is consuming enough alcohol in the evening so that your breath smells of it the following morning. Doing the latter once may be okay\u0026nbspdo it twice or more, and you will be marked down as having “a problem”.\u0026nbspLloyd’s of London bans drink and drugs in the workplaceTimes have changed enormously since I started out, first in the City, then in media. Back then, and we’re talking more than three decades ago, it was standard to head to the nearest wine bar or the pub, and polish off a few glasses of wine or pints of beer before returning to your desk and attempting to work.\u0026nbspSometimes, as a junior, you felt obliged to keep your end up, so when the partners at my law firm, all male, lined up another bottle I would gulp and go along with it. Likewise, as a journalist, you occasionally had to go with the flow\u0026nbspas part of the job.\u0026nbspOne of the booziest lunches I ever had was with Crispin Odey, the hedge fund magnate. When I arrived to interview him at Corrigan’s –\u0026nbspthe super-smart Mayfair restaurant of star chef Richard Corrigan –\u0026nbspI was treated like royalty. Odey was running slightly late, and I was shown to a prime table. The staff bustled around, checking I was okay\u0026nbspnothing was too much for them. Finally\u0026nbsphe arrived, and they went into overdrive.A bottle of normally exquisite –\u0026nbspand expensive –\u0026nbspwhite Burgundy was produced, which Odey decided was not quite right. The sommelier scurried away to fetch another one. Odey glanced at the menu and knew what he wanted: a duck egg to start, followed by, if I agreed, a shared steak and kidney pie. “And what about some beef on the side, let’s have the loin of beef on the side. Lovely. Oh, and we’d better have some mash and some kale –\u0026nbspwe ought to have something green.”He called over the wine waiter again: “And we’d like a bottle of the Leoville.” The Leoville Barton was superb, as was the food. This was mid-week. A bottle of white, and a bottle of red. Beef on the side. Even back then, nobody had lunch like this, not any more, not in oh-so politically correct, watching-the-calories, London. Not on this scale, and even more rarely, at this cost. What’s more, with Odey, there was the feeling this was nothing special. The office of his firm, Odey Asset Management, was across the road, and Corrigan’s might as well have been his canteen.As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible, and started to angle down the page,\u0026nbspuntil the words trailed off completelySo, when I read an interview this week with veteran advertising boss Rory Sutherland, I was drawn to his statement that his industry is inordinately less boozy than it was: “Mind you, everything is less boozy. It was pretty routine at lunchtime to see people in the street outside a pub at 2.30 necking pints. It was also routine in advertising, which I always thought was a good thing which we shouldn’t have lost.”Sutherland was reminiscing in the same month that Lloyd’s of London has issued a new stern code of conduct to the 40,000 pass holders at its Leadenhall Street headquarters. From now on, anyone thought to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be refused entry. This, from what was regarded for its 331 year existence as the high temple of lunchtime boozing.\u0026nbspWho is right, who is wrong? Lloyd’s move was motivated by claims of sexual harassment and bad, laddish behaviour. It effectively signals the end for what was known euphemistically in the City as “liquid negotiations” or what Brexiteer Nigel Farage, a former broker, refers to as PFLs\u0026nbsp– “proper f***ing lunches”.\u0026nbspLike Nigel, I enjoyed my PFLs. Like Rory, too, I look back at them with fondness.\u0026nbspBut I also have to ask myself:\u0026nbspapart from spending what, over the years, would have amounted to a considerable sum of money, piling on the calories, and making me feel terrible the rest of the day, what did they actually achieve? Of course, they fostered camaraderie, of the loud, male, kind.\u0026nbspI also\u0026nbspsaw, though, far too many careers and lives ruined by what began as the odd PFL turning into a daily occurrence. A liquid lunch would then be replicated by something similar in the evening, every evening. One of\u0026nbsp those, doubtless, was Guy Farage, a City trader and alcoholic\u0026nbspwho abandoned the family home and his son, Nigel, then aged five.\u0026nbspDid any good come from them? I would venture, not where progress at work was concerned. I attempted to fire questions at Odey. As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible\u0026nbspand started to angle down the page, until the words trailed off completely. I had to finish the interview when I was sober.\u0026nbspLloyd’s initiative is long overdue. We may miss the lunchtime drinking. But if we’re honest, not really.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But thanks to\u0026nbspColston, who started localised growing programmes in 2018, her descendants have survived. Her great-great-great-great granddaughter is sitting at a table made from oak grown from an acorn Colston planted, and harvested at a a sawmill established under Colston’s watch, which has brought business back to the valley. “Thank you for making change happen and thank you for our future,” the descendant writes.\u0026nbspGovernment set to ‘miss public land housebuilding target by 95,000’NHS hospital in England refusing to accept patients from WalesScottish Government plans to tackle land ownership inequalityIt’s Wednesday lunchtime in an empty shopping unit in the Capitol Centre, Cardiff, and Colston is one of of a handful of residents presenting their vision for the future of the Welsh valleys. Nearly 100 people are gathered, including Welsh assembly members, local councillors, forestry authorities and community groups. The Skyline Project has\u0026nbspspent nine months engaging\u0026nbspartists to unlock residents’\u0026nbspideas about their natural environment. The resulting maps and quotations are pasted all over the gallery walls, including dreams of swimming pools, walking routes, honeybees and wild birds.Colston’s postcard might be fantasy today, but Skyline\u0026nbspsees this artistic reimagining as the first step to a community action plan for the land.One man is here to show them what’s possible. Alastair McIntosh was one of four founders of the Isle of Eigg Trust in 1991, which in the space of six years wrested the island in the Scottish Hebrides from rich owners and put it in the hands of the community. “It’s not about sloganising politics, it’s about figuring out things that are going to work,” he says. “You have to start digging with a teaspoon, then a spade, then a digger, and then political confidence to flow into those channels.”But Scotland has a very different tradition of land ownership. As well as positive examples of community ownership, Scotland has a history of crofting, or long term leases of private land to stewards, and momentum is growing for further reform. An investigation by the Scottish Land Commission found that concentrated land ownership in Scotland, where 1,125 people own 70 per cent of the land, has held back prospects for economic, housing and community development. The commission went so far as to describe the concentration of land ownership in Scotland as “socially corrosive”.The situation in Wales is different. Wales has fewer private landowners. It also has much more public land. The question for the groups involved in Skyline is whether they can get public bodies to support their ideas. “Being able to get land is a political thing,” says Mark Walton, the co-director of Shared Assets. “In Scotland it required legislation. What’s exciting is that Skyline is looking at what is already publicly owned land. It is in the gift of authorities to transfer ownership to communities or give them leases to allow the to manage productively. That’s a massive opportunity because it overcomes the main barrier to entry, which is the cost of buying the land.”Walton says that an ambitious programme of land transfer to communities in urban areas has the potential to revitalise areas still reeling from the death of traditional industry, particularly in Wales and the north of England. But he acknowledges that is it sometimes difficult for authorities to cede power: “Authorities are afraid because this fundamentally changes the relationship between the state and the people. It changes the way the civil servants behave. It changes the dynamic – and that is scary.”Ian Thomas, runs Welcome to Our Woods, a community partnership in the upper Rhondda Fawr making local natural resources accessible to residents. In May, Welcome to Our Woods was awarded £90,000 in grants and loans from the Co-op Foundation, to put towards its project converting waste wood into furniture and biomass fuel, generating income. The money has been generated by the sale of 5p bags in the Co-op’s Welsh supermarkets.In October, Thomas, Colston and other volunteers from other valleys groups visited the Kilfinan Community Forest in Tighnabruaich, which manages ownership of 434 hectares of Acharossan Forest. Chris Blake, who started the Skyline Project, says that the trip proved the possibilities. “To see for yourselves what the forest crofts has achieved in eight years was quite staggering,” he says. “At the end of the day we sat down and suddenly we realised it can be done.”Geraint Davies, the Plaid Cymru councillor for Treherbert ward, is among those at the event in the shopping centre. As visitors browse\u0026nbspthe exhibition, he remembers playing in the mountains as a child:\u0026nbsp“We used to be up there making dams, but you don’t see children up there now.”Would he support community ownership of the land? “I think that would be wonderful,” he says. “It’s very important to get people committed to the area through ownership. In the past people have come in, done things, and gone again.”Lee Waters, the deputy minister for economy and transport at the Welsh assembly, sees Skyline as part of a broader movement for the democratic ownership of land and the economy that is going on in places like Preston in Lancashire and Barcelona in Spain.How South Wales is learning from community forests in Scotland“There has been a profound change going on in the valleys in just two generations. There’s been considerable depopulation\u0026nbspand some areas are returning to semi-rural, which creates a range of policy challenges but also opens up a new way of doing things,” Waters says. “Might the Welsh government give Skyline funding for land? There’s absolutely no reason why we wouldn’t. We’d have to see some detail but I think it’s got huge potential.”Thomas says the seeds of change have already been planted. “When we looked at our land we found that 85 per cent is public estate,” he says. “So we’re not talking about ownership because as far as we’re concerned we already own the land. It’s about what level of stewardship we get. What we are looking at is a micro-hydro scheme, a sawmill, solar farms and forest crofts. This land is opportunity for us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Thousands of pupils from schools, colleges and universities across the UK will walk out in the second major strike against climate change this year. Young people nationwide are calling on the Government to declare a climate emergency and take action. Similar strikes are taking place around the world today including in Japan and Australia, inspired by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg who criticised world leaders at a United Nations climate conferenceThere have also been strong concerns raised over the past year at the rate at which communities are losing easy access to cash amid bank branch and ATM closures.Research from Which? found this week that fees of at least 95p per withdrawal were imposed on nearly 1,700 ATMs between January and March.Some 2.2 million people are estimated to be almost entirely reliant on cash in their daily lives, with the elderly, vulnerable and those in rural communities likely to be hardest hit by a decline.The Treasury said the plans will complement work to support digital payment methods which continue to revolutionise and expand the ways people manage their money.New Royal Mint coins mark 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria’s birthMr Hammond said: “Technology has transformed banking for millions of people, making it easier and quicker to carry out financial transactions and pay for services.“But it’s also clear that many people still rely on cash and I want the public to have choice over how they spend their money.“I’m also setting up a group which brings together the Treasury, Bank of England and the regulators to safeguard the future of cash and ensure its availability for years to come.”Natalie Ceeney, chair\u0026nbspof the Access to Cash review, which recently described the cash system as “on the verge of collapse”, said: “Cash use is falling rapidly, but digital payments don’t yet work for everyone.“We need to safeguard the use of cash for those who need it, and at the same time work hard to ensure that everyone can participate in the digital economy.“If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions of people will be left behind.“I’m delighted to see the government taking a leadership role on this critical issue, and look forward to seeing action as a result.”As well as establishing the Joint Authorities Cash Strategy Group (Jacs) – chaired by the Treasury and bringing together regulators – the government said it will also:– Support the Bank of England’s work to develop a new wholesale cash distribution system to ensure cash is being distributed as needed across the country– Develop a coin checking and validation framework to remove counterfeits from circulation and stop them from ending up in people’s pockets– Continue to support new digital methods of payment while safeguarding access to cash for those who need itThe government said more than £2bn has been invested since 2010 in the Post Office network to support customers in accessing banking services.Currently, 99 per cent of personal customers and 95 per cent\u0026nbspof small business customers can carry out their everyday banking locally at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches.ATM network Link has committed to replacing\u0026nbspclosed machines in rural or remote areas when there is no free ATM within a kilometre or Post Office branch available.Link has also recently implemented new “super premiums” to further safeguard free-to-use ATMs in remote and deprived areas.David Chaplin, head of campaigns at Which?, said: “Millions of people across the UK who rely on cash in their daily lives are currently at risk of being stripped of their ability to pay for essential goods and services – so the government’s unprecedented commitment to protecting cash should finally offer them some reassurance.“This new body must act urgently to address rapid changes to the cash landscape, as its success will be judged by how it ensures people can continue to access their preferred payment method in the face of bank branch and cashpoint closures, intermittent broadband access and regular IT glitches affecting digital payment methods.”Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry said: “The chancellor has shown he is listening to the small business community today.“We called for the appointment of an expert group dedicated to protecting free access to cash and that’s exactly what is now being delivered.“Millions of small business owners have customers that still want to pay in cash.”He continued: “Keeping 1p and 2p coins in circulation is the right call. The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms.“For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned.”Nicky Morgan, chair\u0026nbspof the Treasury Committee, said: “The new Jacs\u0026nbspgroup is a welcome step, but the government must ensure that it implements the Access to Cash Review’s recommendations urgently, and in full, to protect access to cash.“Additionally, HM Treasury should undertake an analysis of the incidence of shops and other service providers not accepting cash, and the chancellor should make cash policy an explicit responsibility of the relevant Treasury minister.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Thousands of pupils from schools, colleges and universities across the UK will walk out in the second major strike against climate change this year. Young people nationwide are calling on the Government to declare a climate emergency and take action. Similar strikes are taking place around the world today including in Japan and Australia, inspired by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg who criticised world leaders at a United Nations climate conferenceThere have also been strong concerns raised over the past year at the rate at which communities are losing easy access to cash amid bank branch and ATM closures.Research from Which? found this week that fees of at least 95p per withdrawal were imposed on nearly 1,700 ATMs between January and March.Some 2.2 million people are estimated to be almost entirely reliant on cash in their daily lives, with the elderly, vulnerable and those in rural communities likely to be hardest hit by a decline.The Treasury said the plans will complement work to support digital payment methods which continue to revolutionise and expand the ways people manage their money.New Royal Mint coins mark 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria’s birthMr Hammond said: “Technology has transformed banking for millions of people, making it easier and quicker to carry out financial transactions and pay for services.“But it’s also clear that many people still rely on cash and I want the public to have choice over how they spend their money.“I’m also setting up a group which brings together the Treasury, Bank of England and the regulators to safeguard the future of cash and ensure its availability for years to come.”Natalie Ceeney, chair\u0026nbspof the Access to Cash review, which recently described the cash system as “on the verge of collapse”, said: “Cash use is falling rapidly, but digital payments don’t yet work for everyone.“We need to safeguard the use of cash for those who need it, and at the same time work hard to ensure that everyone can participate in the digital economy.“If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions of people will be left behind.“I’m delighted to see the government taking a leadership role on this critical issue, and look forward to seeing action as a result.”As well as establishing the Joint Authorities Cash Strategy Group (Jacs) – chaired by the Treasury and bringing together regulators – the government said it will also:– Support the Bank of England’s work to develop a new wholesale cash distribution system to ensure cash is being distributed as needed across the country– Develop a coin checking and validation framework to remove counterfeits from circulation and stop them from ending up in people’s pockets– Continue to support new digital methods of payment while safeguarding access to cash for those who need itThe government said more than £2bn has been invested since 2010 in the Post Office network to support customers in accessing banking services.Currently, 99 per cent of personal customers and 95 per cent\u0026nbspof small business customers can carry out their everyday banking locally at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches.ATM network Link has committed to replacing\u0026nbspclosed machines in rural or remote areas when there is no free ATM within a kilometre or Post Office branch available.Link has also recently implemented new “super premiums” to further safeguard free-to-use ATMs in remote and deprived areas.David Chaplin, head of campaigns at Which?, said: “Millions of people across the UK who rely on cash in their daily lives are currently at risk of being stripped of their ability to pay for essential goods and services – so the government’s unprecedented commitment to protecting cash should finally offer them some reassurance.“This new body must act urgently to address rapid changes to the cash landscape, as its success will be judged by how it ensures people can continue to access their preferred payment method in the face of bank branch and cashpoint closures, intermittent broadband access and regular IT glitches affecting digital payment methods.”Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry said: “The chancellor has shown he is listening to the small business community today.“We called for the appointment of an expert group dedicated to protecting free access to cash and that’s exactly what is now being delivered.“Millions of small business owners have customers that still want to pay in cash.”He continued: “Keeping 1p and 2p coins in circulation is the right call. The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms.“For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned.”Nicky Morgan, chair\u0026nbspof the Treasury Committee, said: “The new Jacs\u0026nbspgroup is a welcome step, but the government must ensure that it implements the Access to Cash Review’s recommendations urgently, and in full, to protect access to cash.“Additionally, HM Treasury should undertake an analysis of the incidence of shops and other service providers not accepting cash, and the chancellor should make cash policy an explicit responsibility of the relevant Treasury minister.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it has revealed next to nothing about what exactly went wrong.Now\u0026nbspHans\u0026nbspKoenigsmann, vice president of flight reliability for SpaceX, admitted that there had been an anomaly. But the company continued to be tight-lipped about the details of the problem.The April 20 accident occurred on a landing zone at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as SpaceX was conducting a test of emergency thrusters designed to propel the capsule, dubbed Crew Dragon, to safety from atop the rocket in the event of a launch failure.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

There were no injuries. SpaceX had taken all safety measures prior to this test, as we always do.The news conference was called ahead of Friday\u0027s scheduled launch of an unmanned resupply mission to the international space station using a cargo-only capsule built by SpaceX, the private rocket venture of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.When pressed, Koenigsmann declined to characterise the nature of the accident, including whether an explosion or fire was involved. NASA has likewise demurred when asked to describe the mishap.A leaked video of the accident, which was acknowledged as authentic by a NASA contractor in an internal memo obtained by the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, showed the astronaut capsule blasting into smithereens. A pall of smoke was also widely observed rising over the launch pad from a distance at the time of the ill-fated test.The Crew Dragon had been scheduled to carry US\u0026nbspastronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station in a test mission in July, although the recent accident, as well as some other hitches in the vehicle\u0027s design, are likely to push that schedule to later in the year or into 2020.It\u0027s certainly not great news for the schedule overall, but I hope we can recover, Koenigsmann said.The destroyed vehicle was one of six such capsules built or in late production by SpaceX, and the first flown into space. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched it without crew to the space station in March for a six-day visit before returning to Earth, splashing down safely in the Atlantic for retrieval.We have no reason to believe there is an issue with the SuperDracos themselves, Koenigsmann said, adding that the engines have been tested nearly 600 times in the past.NASA has been awarded $6.8bn to SpaceX and rival Boeing Co to develop separate capsule systems to fly astronauts to space, but both companies have faced technical challenges and delays.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Similar strikes are taking place around the world today including in Japan and Australia, inspired by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg who criticised world leaders at a United Nations climate conferenceMs Vigor-Mungovin said she is “99 per cent certain” she has located the right grave. “Everything fits, it is too much to be a coincidence”.His unmarked grave was narrowed down to a memorial garden at first, but Ms Vigor-Mungovin said a more specific spot was then identified with the help of cemetery authorities.She said Mr Merrick\u0026nbspsoon would be given a fitting\u0026nbspmemorial plaque.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit policy questions are dominating the news, and the party that looks likely to win is called the Brexit Party.This may seem strange, given the elections will have no direct effect on the Brexit process, but it’s the way it is.However, it is not so everywhere. You might wonder what the elections are about across the rest of the continent, which is understandably less bothered by Brexit.Frankly, there is not just one answer. While there are some shared issues across the continent, each European parliament national election is effectively its own mini-contest. People vote for the parties they know: the votes\u0026nbspare sometimes used to give governments bloody noses, or to express support for others domestically.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyIn Germany, for instance, the parties would like to focus on who has the best ideas for the future of the EU. In France, it has devolved into a two-horse race between Macron’s pro-EU list, and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally.\u0026nbspFrom Widdecombe to Sargon, EU elections are a dinner party from hellThat there is no single European polity, but in fact a collection of 28 different ones, has been an emerging criticism of the way the EU is set up. If people are focused on their national political systems, the increasingly important one in Brussels feels ever more remote.There have been some moves to make the system more European-wide. The spitzencandidat system debuted at the last elections in 2014 is supposed to link the results of the elections to who the next European Commission president is. But given how separate\u0026nbspthe elections in different countries are, it hasn’t necessarily worked as some might hope.There are proposals for future reforms, such as trans-national lists where people in different countries can vote for candidates standing across the EU. Those are yet to be agreed, though there is support for the principle in Brussels. But for now, the answer to the question of what the EU elections are about on the continent is… it depends.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Let\u0027s do a deal.”But her perilous position was undermined by a survey suggesting a record 82 per cent of Conservative members want her to quit immediately, following the party’s local elections\u0026nbspwipeout.Farage party ‘fastest growing political force’ with 85,000 membersAs Ms May prepared for fresh demands to name a departure day when MPs return to Westminster, her own chief-of-staff quit a Tory WhatsApp group, protesting “I have had enough” of attacks on her.Created with Sketch.Put It To The People march: Best of The Independent’s pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The fresh acrimony between the two parties broke out as Labour claimed that details of the talks had been briefed to Tory newspapers to give the impression an agreement was only days away.A Conservative source told The Independent the party was “optimistic” of a quick conclusion, saying: “Tuesday will be the time when we know the likelihood of a possible deal.”An agreement had appeared more likely after both Ms May and Mr Corbyn – in the wake of their joint local elections defeat – were pushing their parties to compromise.Strikingly, a senior Labour source denied the resumption of cross-party talks on Tuesday would be a make-or-break moment, even as the Tories insisted it would.Although the prime minister has conceded a form of customs union, she appears to be pushing for it to be temporary, a demand that Labour says has not been raised across the negotiating table.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, dismissed the idea of progress, saying: “Although the government is trying to redress their customs union offer, they haven’t really shifted.”Ruling out Tory hopes of still doing trade deals in services, he warned: “With the United States, that could mean Trump’s America and big private healthcare corporations getting their hands on NHS contracts.”There will be no end to Brexit if May and Corbyn agree to a dealYounger generation will be forced to clear up Brexit chaos, heads toldLib Dems to press for tougher EU-wide climate change actionVoters punishing Labour for its Brexit ‘fudge’, angry MPs warn CorbynMr McDonnell went further, saying he did not “trust” the prime minister because she had blown the confidentiality of the talks to prop up her position.“She\u0027s jeopardised the negotiations for her own personal protection,” he said, adding: “We\u0027re dealing with a very unstable government.“It\u0027s trying to enter into a contract with a company that\u0027s going into administration and the people who are going to take over are not willing to fulfil that contract. We can\u0027t negotiate like that.”Mr McDonnell also came close to admitting his own side would demand a Final Say referendum on any deal, as Tom Watson, the deputy leader, has demanded.Mr Watson himself said: “I don\u0027t think we should give false hope on this, it\u0027s going to be very difficult to find a negotiated settlement.”Tory fears about a deal were spooked further by Nigel Farage boasting that 85,000 people have signed up to his new Brexit Party to make it “the fastest growing political force in the land”.Almost £2m has flooded in within a few weeks from grassroots supporters, ahead of a predicted victory in the European elections later this month, the former Ukip leader said.Rory Stewart, the new international development secretary, claimed the two parties were only “a quarter of an inch apart” – and even said a split in the Tory party was a price worth paying to secure a deal.That split was laid bare by the survey for Conservative Home website, putting the proportion of party members demanding a new leader at 82 per cent.The same website revealed Gavin Barwell, the No 10 chief of staff, had pulled out of the WhatsApp group on his Croydon home patch, because of “attacks I would expect from our worst opponents”.Graham Brady, the head of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, is expected to meet Ms May on Tuesday to again urge her to set a date for her departure.If she refuses, they will consider rewriting the rules to allow a fresh vote of no confidence this summer – a move the 1922 stepped back from last month.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

– as The Independent revealed last year.Officers from South Africa’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals discovered 108 neglected animals living in conditions they described as “horrendous” at Pienika Farm in the North West Province.Killing of Cecil the lion encourages UK hunters to kill more big cats Protests against trophy hunting to be held worldwide Suspected poacher killed by elephant then eaten by lionsRomania outlaws trophy hunting of bears, wolves and wild catsPrince William says trophy hunting is justified in some circumstances“Other issues such as small enclosures and inadequate shelter, no provision of water, overcrowding, and filthy and parasitic conditions were noted in the camps that contained the lions, caracals, tigers, and leopards,” said NSPCA senior inspector Douglas Wolhuter.“Twenty-seven of the lions had mange, and the caracals were obese and unable to properly groom themselves.”Two cubs that appeared to have a neurological condition were unable to walk, he said. They were confiscated and taken for specialist treatment.The cubs are exploited their whole lives, first as props by tourists, then for\u0026nbsp‘walking with lion’ safarisIt’s estimated up to 12,000 lions are raised on South Africa’s 260 captive breeding facilities. The country’s quota for exporting lion bones is 1,500 skeletons a year.\u0026nbspThe trade in lion bones for Asian medicine grew out of the hunting of captive-bred lions.After the squalid farm was discovered, conservation group Humane Society InternationalAfrica called for the South African government to shut down the captive breeding industry.Audrey Delsink, wildlife director of HSIAfrica, said: “Lion cubs are ripped from their mothers at just a few days old to be hand-reared by paying volunteers from countries such as the UK, who are misled into believing the cubs are orphans.“The cubs are exploited their whole lives, first as props by paying tourists, then later as part of ‘walking with lion’ safaris. Once too big and dangerous for this, they are killed for their bones which are exported to Asia for traditional medicines or sold to be killed by trophy hunters largely from the United States in ‘canned’ hunts in which hand-reared lions are shot in a fenced area.”The fate of the lions will depend on the outcome of the legal process, Ms Delsink said.Pienika Farm is reportedly owned by Jan Steinman, a member of the council of the South African Predator Association (Sapa), which says it does not support canned lion hunting but stands for “responsible hunting”.\u0026nbspA statement to The Independent by Sapa said: “Sapa is aware of the complaints. It will now be dealt with in terms of the Sapa code of conduct and disciplinary process. Corrective measures will be enforced once the Sapa council processed all the facts at hand.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not even big-hearted Brad has pockets that deep.He is still in the middle of a messy and drawn out orce battle with estranged we Angelina Jolie and he has all that maintenance and child support to take into account.Brad and Jenner were the ultimate golden couple at the height of their power and beauty when they split almost  years ago.It depends on what version of events you believe, but they either called time on their relationship before Brad fell head over heels in lust with Angelina on the set of Mr And Mrs Smith, or she was the other woman who swooped in and bedazzled him.I don’t happen to think you can “steal” someone’s lover or partner, and there must surely have been some flaws in Brad and Jenner’s marriage for him to have taken up with Angelina in the first place.It has to be said, though, that the timeline has always been rather fuzzy.Angelina did once say in an interview that Mr And Mrs Smith was a chance for their children to watch Mum and Dad falling in love, and that they had all sat down in front of the TV as a family to watch the film on DVD.This prompted Jenner to hit back, albeit in a classy and dignied fashion, saying she had no idea anything was going on at that time, and Angelina’s remarks were “uncool” and “inappropriate”.Jenner has never really vented any feelings of hurt and anger in public, and always behaved like a lady. I do wonderBrad ever laments the loss of the uncomplicated woman he once loved so very much.For a time, Brad and Angelina appeared to be extremely happy with their brood of children and stellar film careers, but no one knows what really goes on behind closed doors and it all started to unravel for them almost three years ago.There were accusations and recriminations on both sides in a bloody war of attrition that really should have reached a truce by this stage.Interestingly, both Brad and Jenner are now single, though he was linked to Charlize Theron in January.Her short-lived marriage to American actor Justin Theroux went belly-up last year.The rumour mill went into hyperdrive when Brad turned up at Jenner’s th bash in February and the two were seen to be getting on well.There would be something very satisfying about this ridiculously good-looking, hugely successful famous ex-couple getting back together, but I’m not sureyou can ever reheat the souffle.Perhaps you can eventually become friends, but whether or not you can forgive heartaches, betrayals and past pain is debatable.Sadly, I don’t think we will be celebrating Brad and Jen the sequel any time soon.THIS time last year my lovely friend and colleague Helen Addis was diagnosed with breast cancer, and the world went from colour to black and white.She is only , has three young kids and her cancer was particularly ugly and aggressive.Twelve months down the line, after gruelling treatment, Helen has somehow transformed her devastating diagnosis into a real positive.Thanks to her courage and tenacity, and her cracking good idea, she will actually be saving lives.Helen’s simple but effective plan is to have a sticker on the mirror of changing rooms in shops and gyms showing what changes to look out for in your breasts, as well as details of my colleague Dr Hilary Jones’s guide to checking online.So when you are checking yourself out in a new outfit, you can also remember to check your boobs.For more information see itv lorraineTHE birth of any new baby is a cause of joy and celebration.For the parents, it’s emotional, uplting, overwhelming and also a tiny bit scary.Harry and Meghan will be no dferent to any other mum and dad because, unlike domestic appliances, babies don’t come with instruction manuals.The royal couple will be nervous about the first bath and will anxiously listen out for their little one breathing during the night.Despite all the expert advice they can count on, they will still be typical, nervous, first-time parents.While I totally respect their right to a certain degree of privacy during the later stages of pregnancy and the birth, I do think it was a mistake to fly so low under the radar at this time.The most dangerous development for any member of the Royal Family isn’t rampant republicanism. Instead, the big threat is indference.If people don’t care any more about the royals then the whole fragile monarchy could crumble like a stale meringue.Obviously, just like all new mums and dads Harry and Meghan will want and need time to adjust to being a family.It would, however, be a shame , as has been forecast, they decide to completely withdraw from public le for the foreseeable future apart from some very cute Instagram posts.There’s a danger people will shrug their shoulders and find other online influencers, or fail to turn up in all weathers to line the streets and give hearty cheers when Harry and Meghan eventually do resurface.Apart from the Queen, no member of the Royal Family can take the adulation, support or even tolerance of the British public for granted.Harry and Meghan have the potential to be a tremendous asset to the royals and there’s huge affection for both of them, especially now.They can build on this and make a better future for all the world’s children, as well as their little one.MADONNA kicked ass at the Billboard Awards in Vegas earlier this week.She showed all the young pretenders that there really is only one true Queen Of Pop – and she’s a -year-old woman with chipmunk cheeks and the tight, muscular body of a -year-old pole dancer.I love her new ­single, Medellin, and I adored that ­Billboard performance complete with state-of-the-art Madonna holograms.It made everyone  look a little bit ordinary.There have been many imitators over the years, but there is only one Madonna. No one  even comes close.TONY SLATTERY was once a constant presence on our screens.He seemed to be on every single TV  show and had the same sort of manic comic genius displayed by the late, great Robin Williams.Tony largely disappeared from public le in the late Nineties and endured a long struggle with mental health issues as well as booze and drug addiction. At one point he admits he was spending four grand a week on cocaine and vodka.I often wondered what had happened to Tony, and it was heartening to see him popping up on This Morning this week, talking openly about being bipolar and living with depression.He’s older, greyer and wiser, and very lucky to have the support of his partner of  years, actor Mark Michael Hutchinson.It’s just a real shame that at a time when Tony really needed help, talking about mental health was still taboo and could end your career. Thank the Lord things are slowly changing for the better.I wish Tony all the best as he rebuilds his career and looks forward to performing again at the Edinburgh Festival this summer. The world needs his funny, witty and honest take on le.SACKED Defence Secretary Gavin ­Williamson has sworn on his ­children’s lives that he didn’t leak ­Cabinet secrets.That’s a bold and vehement statement that no loving dad would ever make lightly.Whatever the truth, it’s another example of the utter shambles at the heart of Westminster, and how worrying that no one is the least bit surprised or shocked by these allegations.TODAY is an important one for Star Wars fans, who celebrate the date as “May The th Be With You”.See what they did there I’m actually more concerned about the magnicent sci-fi TV series The Orville, with no word yet on whether the genius creation of Seth ­MacFarlane has been renewed for a third series.I’d love fellow geeks to put me out of my misery and confirm whether we can look forward to more episodes of a show that captures the true essence of my beloved Star Trek in a far more affectionate and authentic way than its rival Star Trek: Discovery.It would be a travestywe weren’t able to boldly go on new adventures with the funny, exasperating, lovable and entertaining crew of The Orville.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nevena says: Let’s choose one day in a week at least when we won’t switch on the telly to see the latest Brexit news.If someone mentions Brexit, stay out of it. Put the boundaries and just say, If you don’t mind I prefer not to talk about Brexit today.Westminster insiders believe the group will soon start pitching to create a reality show similar to the Real Housewives franchise.As well as lestyle advice, they share fashion tips with featured products including £ Louboutin shoes, a jumpsuit costing £, and a £, jacket from Tom Ford.One Tory MP told The Sun that Brits would be raging when they saw the way Westminster WAGs are apparently living.He said: Its a terrible idea - it will make voters think we all drive Bentleys!Mrs Bridgen denied that political wives are out of touch with real le, saying the fashion-related posts are aspirational.And she admitted shed be pleasedthe project ended up on TV, adding that she wants to be inspiring and informative for the general public. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000480474208.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tories cant defend themselves from corbyns cult with theresa may in charge","story":"It is disastrous that this party and Prime Minister are so easily derailed by Corbyn and his social media fanclub — and so useless at exposing his transparently flawed arguments.Labour would have you believe we live in a Victorian-era nightmare where every aspect of society is crumbling and top-hatted Tory toffs make billions off the backs of the poor.Most people know what guff this is, what an absurd caricature.Yet Theresa May’s failure to counter it gives it legs.Of course Britain has problems.The prosperity gap between North and South and young and old, house prices out of reach for Millennials, too many people needing food banks or sleeping rough. Wages still too low.But the PM could hammer home our historically low unemployment, record high employment, pay now rising much faster than inflation, the deficit finally reduced to manageable levels, the richest now paying a higher percentage of tax than ever.She could talk up the Tories slashing the number of workless households which shamefully built up under Labour’s welfare culture. Or their world-beating record on climate change.But mostly Mrs May indulges Corbyn’s fictions, changes the subject or snarks back. Which gives his case credence.It’s time she faced facts. The party she has devoted her le to is demoralised, exhausted and staring into the abyss.Only a charismatic new leader can energise it, pull it together, focus minds on its successes and convince Britain it is worth voting for.And only thenit delivers Brexit as promised.THINGS look bad for the Tories and Labour, but they’re in for a far worse shock.A local election millions of Brexiteers snubbed is no real guide to any party’s fortunes.If  per cent of voters back Nigel Farage’s outfit at the European elections in three weeks the damage to the main parties will be truly vast.It may wipe the temporary grins off Lib-Dem faces too — more so“Change UK” eat into their Remainer vote.The Tories had a shocker on Thursday but at least they expected it.They’ve been in power nine years. They’ve failed so far on Brexit. Labour, though, is out of excuses for their staggering losses, despite a Government in disarray.Sensible MPs know the truth. Their incoherent, anti-Semitic extremist of a leader is toxic among anyone remotely normal.

This is not a mistake but a clever addition to stop the cups breaking and to make them easier to wash up.A spokesman for Amomedia said: “For many years, humans have invented things that make our lives easier in every way.“There are many objects that we use on a daily basis but never notice their true purpose.”The  are:Tiny buttons inside pockets are rivets to prevent the jeans tearing due to movement and over time.They were created in the s when a housewe complained about her husband’s work clothes falling apart.It’s not advertising, it is actually the perfect point at which to tap the bottle in order to get the sauce to pour.This is supposed to stop water pooling after washing a mug and placing it upside down in on the draining board or dishwasher.It also allows air to flow beneath the cups when full of hot drink to stop them breaking.You may think this is to hang them up but they are also designed to hold utensils during cooking so food drips into the saucepan.So many children and adults chew the pen lid that the tiny hole was added so thataccidentally swallowed it allows air to pass through and is a potential lesaver.Not just for decoration but originally dates back to French sailors who used to hit their head on the low ceilings in boats so the bobble was added to protect their heads.Tradesmen may know this but many may not realise the metal bit has several uses.The hole in it can grip a nail to keep one end held tight and the serrated edge can mark a wall for the starting point of measuring.Although childproof lids are effective, the stopper prevents everything falling out and is an extra safeguard should the kids get the top off.But for adults, it can easily be avoided by turning the bottle upside down when opening.The ridges are to help beginners remember where to place their fingers first.Not meant to clean shoes, but to make people stand away from the edge of escalators and prevent coats and bags getting caught in the machinery, which is the main cause of accidents.The strange shape of screwdriver handles are not just for hands to grip but helps them to go into a wrench for extra dficult jobs.The arrow points to the side of the car the petrol filler is on.It is a cool hack on Apple and some other chargers as a place to wrap the cable round to keep it tidy and from getting twisted up.If you have an iPhone, then you might have seen a weird dot next to the camera. It’s a microphone, used to record when people are using the rear camera.Prevents water from accumulating inside which could rust the metal on outdoor locks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s their antics that have cost us tonight.”He was just one of several leading Labour councillors who spoke in similarly scathing terms about the damage done by their party’s Brexit shenanigans.And it affects the Conservative Party just as much — , lost council seats can be seen no other way.Anybody who has knocked on a door in the last few weeks knows this is how the country feels and realises the danger our democratic system facesthis lack of trust is not addressed.The public holds both major parties responsible.Unfortunately, it has reached the stage now where one fears the worst and wonders what next pitfall awaits.There are at least two imminent bear traps.The first is a pact with the devil, whereby the Prime Minister does a deal with Jeremy Corbyn simply to wish the problem of Brexit away.Of course, it won’t work. If the UK remains in the Customs Union, it will be a betrayal of Brexit.It will lead to a path that leads to remaining in the single market and subjection to EU law, and it will stop the UK making trade deals with the rest of the world.What a pathetic state of affairs. Essentially agreeing anything, just anything, so long as we no longer have to talk about Brexit. Of course, this would be disastrous. Corbyn is a neo-Marxist.The public do not trust him. This is another clear message from these local elections. Why do deals with somebody so discredited  The very idea filled Conservative councillors, and not a few Tory voters, with fury during this campaign.The second trap would be carrying on regardless.Stick with the Prime Minister’s thrice-rejected deal and claim “there is no alternative”.This seems to be the default position on this Government since last summer.This path will lead to more disagreement, more misery and a hammering in the European Elections the like of which no governing party has ever seen.The Government’s proposed Withdrawal Agreement is deeply flawed.How many times have they been told this  It subjects the UK to EU law-making and hands over £billion for very little in .It was only able to be made tolerablethe Northern Ireland backstop was scrapped or time limited. This is why the House of Commons passed the Brady Amendment.Notably it was literally the only thing the House could agree on.The message was clear — scrap the backstop. Replace with common sense proposals. Anything less is unacceptable.So, what should the Government do now Obviously, it should honour the pledges of all major parties and carry out Brexit speedily and cleanly, preferably with a deal, but failing that, without a deal.That is what the public was promised and that is what the public expects.I have lost count of the number of members of the public who have come up to me, astonished bythe “naivety of a House of Commons who threw away our strongest negotiating card, the threat of No Deal”.It might be politically dficult. It might need courage. But nothing  will suffice.Ignoring the millions of protest votes and spoilt ballot papers will lead to nothing but further misery.The public will respect an admission that mistakes have been made.It will respect an attempt to reconnect the Conservative Party with its voters, activists and members.To ignore one of the angriest responses we have ever witnessed at election time would be suicidal. Surely nobody wants that  Face up, be realistic and put right the mistakes.Go back to the EU and give it one last chance. Renegotiate an acceptable agreement, or we will leave calmly and speedily without a deal.Scrap the European Elections and set the date for leaving as June .

The idea is that it softens the cervix, stimulating labour.Having sex is also thought to help, with orgasms swinging the womb into action.Another method is “kerb walking” where one foot is on the ground and the other on a small ledge.The motion, which is said to open the pelvis, can be done by walking sideways up stairs too — but take great care. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Director Luke Hildyard said: People donapost want to live in a society with such huge ides between those at the top and everybody . There are big problems with the business culture in the UK and putting shareholders in charge of the system has failed.    We now need to be much bolder about giving workers representation on company boards and ensuring that when companies do well, all staff get a share of the profits.

Bailing out a failing PM and her unpopular bad deal would be political suicide – a real Shakespearean tragedy for a democratic socialist party which has vowed to radically renew Britain, both economically and socially. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, one of Corbyn’s closest comrades and Labour’s smartest clearer of obstacles on the path to power, has publicly declared that he doesn’t trust May. It sounds like he’s preparing to blame her for the collapse of stalemated talks between the two parties. By admitting that Corbyn’s message of hope is popular with people of all backgrounds and incomes, Tory Schools Minister Nick Gibb has highlighted wider Conservative fears.    Brexit is not the only show in town. In fact it’s a distraction from Labour’s offer on wages, housing, public services, environment, fairness and letting everyone fulfil their potential. Promising a new referendum when public opinion is turning against Brexit and Parliament is paralysed could be a deal-maker for Labour in the next General Election. Complacency about Labour’s European majorityis no longer an option. Signicant gains by the Lib Dems and Greens in England’s council elections show how easily disgruntled stayers can move to new homes. And only the most blinkered Labour supporters ignore the disappointment of losing scores of seats instead of painting hundreds red in May’s blue bloodbath of nearly , losses.    The results confirmed what Corbyn’s circle discuss only in private:he gets to Downing Street this Labour PM would most likely lead a minority Government or a coalition. Projecting council results into a badly hung Parliament, expert number crunchers Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher predict the result as  Tory MPs and  Labour. In that case, the only viable coalition would be Labour backed by  SNP MPs, with  Lib Dems possibly playing a tricksy supporting role. Council battles and May ’s European Parliament contests are not General Election blueprints, but nor should they be ignored. Saving Theresa May would be Corbyn’s biggest mistake.

The demands come as a UN-backed global assessment is set to warn a million species face extinction and damage to the natural world threatens humanity.

Supporters believe cutting the amount of food scraped into bins will ultimately boost the environment. Marcus Gover, Chief Executive of campaigner group WRAP, said: “I is worth reminding ourselves that unless we fix the world’s food system we will not be able to bring about the reduction in global warming we need to halt the damage to our planet.”  Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: “Every year, around , tonnes of readily available and perfectly edible food goes uneaten. “It’s time to join together and ‘step up to the plate’ to stop good food going to waste.” "},{"url":null,"title":"record number tory members think","story":"NewsRecord number of Tory members think Theresa May should quit as Prime MinisterA poll by political blog Conservative Home has found that % of their party member  respondents want Theresa May to stand downShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsIt has been a rough week for the Prime Minister \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA record number of Tory party members think Theresa May should step aside as Prime Minister, according to new figures.A poll by political blog Conservative Home has found that % of their party member  respondents want Theresa May to stand down as party leader and to call a leadership election.

Gemmaaposs sister Debbie, at the screening with two other kids, confronted the men at the end of the film. But they continued their torment - and it left Gemma visibly traumatised. Amy added: They replied with more abuse. The altercation lasted ten or  minutes. It resulted in my auntie who has Downaposs syndrome having to stand outside the cinema with the children trying to console her while she was in tears. I rang the cinema that night. I put in a complaint.  The family are now fearful of ing to the cinema in East End, Plymouth. It doesn’t feel like a safe place anymore. We honestly thought today’s society was better than shouting verbal abuse at a lady with Down’s syndrome. It is just appalling that we thought the cinema was a safe place to take her and the children obviously not so safe when things like this happen, Amy, of Efford, Plymouth, added. A Vue Cinema spokesman said: We always strive to ensure our customers enjoy their experience at Vue. We have been in touch with Amy to discuss her visit and as with all customers, will work hard to make sure that she is able to enjoy future visits to Vue.

I will be joining millions around the UK and beyond by fasting from dawn until sunset every night for a month, and documenting my experience below as I go. Fasting, or apossawmapos as itaposs known in Arabic, is one of the five pillars of Islam. By giving up food, we think about those who are less fortunate than ourselves, and may not know when their next meal will come. But itaposs not just about food, itaposs about being grateful and appreciating all the things you have.  For me, it has always been a way to realign myself with my faith every year.  Some days I find myself feeling more focused, mindful and at peace. I feel the benefits, I see the purpose of it and I even enjoy it, telling myself I might just fast on random days during the year to ground myself.  But other days I feel I canapost cope, my stomach grumbles, I consider giving up, I feel void of energy and Iaposve had enough. For the next month, Iaposm going to blog my experience to lt the lid on what fasting is really like.  Being as honest as I can be, I will write about my highs, my lows and everything in between. Iaposll also aim to answer all those questions youaposve probably never dared ask. To start with a few: No youaposre not allowed to drink water, yes you can brush your teeth, no I donapost believe it is harmful to your healthitaposs done sensibly , no you canapost just eat something and aposnot tell anyoneapos and yes you can swallow your own saliva... When is Ramadan  It is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which is determined by the lunar cycle. When it starts is based on the sighting of the new moon, which marks the beginning of the month. If the new moonis spotted, fasting begins the following day. Similarly when determining the last day of Ramadan,the new moon is sighted the holy month is complete and Eid is celebrated the following day. Local sightings of the moon can dfer, which is why there can be discrepancies between the days dferent countries start and end their fast. It moves about  days each year in the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the solar year. Ramadan can last either  or  days.    Ramadan is imminent and I feel totally unprepared Ramadan begins on Monday, and I feel totally unprepared. The truth is, thereaposs no way to get yourself ready mentally - it seems to just come around really quickly every year and you just have to get on with it. Iaposve written a checklist - or shopping list - of what I need to get beforehand. Dates come top of the list as Muslims break their fast with dates every night. Itaposs a tradition that goes back to the Prophet Muhammed, and the high levels of sugar are a great way to boost your energy having not eaten for hours.  Iaposm going to hit Tesco and make sure my fridge is well stocked for the night times. Then Iaposll have a huge feast, drink lots of water and go to bed ready for the challenge to begin.

It takes just a few minutes to complete and it can be done pretty much anywhere.Writing for the Mail on Sunday , Dr Michael Mosley explained that while BMI is often used as an indicator when working out how many people are overweight, the system has several flaws.For example, as muscle is heavier than fat it can sometimes skew the results. Instead he recommends the string test.    All you need to do is get a ball of string and cut a piece which is as tall as you are. Take the newly cut piece and fold it in half. Wrap the folded string around your middle by your belly button and seeyou can makes the ends meet. Dr Mosley writes: The build-up of visceral fat is normally the result of a number of dferent factors, which include eating too much sugary, starchy food, drinking too much alcohol , not doing enough exercise, feeling stressed and sleeping badly, and, of course, genetics.    Some people, when they put on weight, immediately put it on around the gut. I’m one of them. The good news is that studies show visceral fat responds well to weight-loss regimes and exercise. Any decent diet and exercise regime will help, but a rapid weight-loss regime that includes an element of intermittent fasting and fast exercise – high-intensity interval training, or HIIT – of the sort I recommend in my latest book, The Fast , seems to be particularly effective.

Beneath the sands near the pyramids on the outskirts of capital Cairo, a striking Old Kingdom burial site was revealed to contain the remains of a priest and a noble, along with a fine limestone statute.Egypt Today reports the excavation mission in the south-eastern part of the pyramids plateau began in August . Egyptian media were told the newly discovered tombs date back to the fth dynasty of the Old Kingdom, when Pharaohs still ruled the ancient lands in the period between the early th and mid-th century BC.The General Secretary of the Supreme Council of Antiquities Mostafa Waziri told a press conference the dig uncovered tombs containing two closed coffins, known as sarcophagi, as well as archaeological relics belonging to priests.

The dramatic U-turn on the plans to introduce the hard-line punishment for same-sex unions will be hailed as a victory by LGBT rights campaigners and celebrities fighting Bruneiaposs incoming legislation. The tiny south-east Asian country today extended its moratorium on introducing the internationally-criticised interpretation of Islamic Sharia laws. Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah rethink comes after its plans were thrust into the global spotlight in the backlash led by celebrities including George Clooney and Elton John. The protests included boycotts of the sultanaposs own hotels and threated the countryaposs tourism industry.  The country sparked an outcry when it rolled out its latest interpretation of Islamic laws, known as Sharia, on April . It would have seen Brunei punish sodomy, adultery and rape with death - including by stoning. The country also planned to introduced a separate penalty for lesbian sex, with punishment including  strokes of the cane and up to  years in jail. Brunei has consistently defended its right to implement the laws, which began to kick in from .    However, in a rare response to criticism aimed at the oil-rich state, the sultan said the death penalty would not be imposed when Brunei implements its SyariahPenal Code Order . “I am aware that there are many questions and misperceptions with regard to the implementation of the SPCO, the sultan said in a speech ahead of the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. However, we believe that once these have been cleared, the merit of the law will be evident. “As evident for more than two decades, we have practiced a de facto moratorium on the execution of death penalty for cases under the common law.   Crimes including murder and drug trafficking already attract the death penalty in Brunei. However no executions have been carried out since the s. The vastly wealthy sultan, who once piloted his own  airliner to meet former US president Barack Obama, often faces criticism from activists who view his absolute monarchy as despotic. However, it is unusual for the leader to respond, and even more so for the sultan’s office to release an official English translation of his speech as it did today. “Both the common law and the Syariahlaw aim to ensure peace and harmony of the country,” the sultan continued in todayaposs speech. “They are also crucial in protecting the morality and decency of the country as well as the privacy of iniduals.” The law’s implementation, which the United Nations condemned, prompted celebrities and rights groups to seek a boycott on hotels owned by the sultan, including the Dorchester in London and the Beverley Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. Several multinational companies have since put a ban on staff using the sultan’s hotels, while some travel companies have stopped promoting Brunei as a tourist destination.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it.

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

We need to find a mechanism to make it financially viable to build.Twenty miles south of Oban and carved from solid bedrock, Cruachanrsquos cavernous machine hall sits km inside the mountain. The size of a football pitch, it is ft high, nearly ft long and spacious enough to accommodate a seven-storey building.Conceived by hydroelectricity pioneer Sir Edward MacColl, and engineered by Glasgow-based James Williamson  Partners, its construction saw , cubic metres of rock and soil scooped from its innards. The task involved around , workers, many drawn from Ireland by the prospect of high wages, who swapped home for a makesht camp and back-breaking, filthy -hour shts.Today the cavern they chiselled from the guts of Cruachan is pristine, home to four generator sets powered by water from a reservoir and Loch Awe, capable of delivering a total of  megawattsof electricity ndash enough to supply more than , homes ndash and flexible enough to power up within seconds, reaching full pumping speed in a mere eight minutes.For the young Kenny Omond, a Heriot-Watt University electronics engineering student looking for a summer job in , Ben Cruachanrsquos exposed innards were both terrying and mesmerising, with conditions that surely no ldquoCruachan Two project would ever endure.ldquoIt was like Dantersquos Inferno, says Omond, , from Livingston. ldquoThe machine hall was probably as big as St Giles Cathedral, with little tunnels spinning off.ldquoThere were huge dump trucks going up and down these little corridors. The tyres were eight feet high and the tunnels so narrow that you had to flatten yourself against the walls as they rolled by.It was an age, he recalls, when safety gear largely consisted of a hard hat and crossed fingers.ldquoThere was the peaceful beauty of Loch Awe, but inside the mountain the noise was unbearable, Omond shudders. ldquoThere were boxes of gelignite just lying around.As well as the cavernous machine room, construction involved km of tunnels including two that stretch m and at -degree angles, and a m buttressed concrete gravity dam some m up the mountainside. It was not for the faint-hearted  men lost their lives, hundreds of others were injured.Tunnel Tiger Ian MacLean, , of Taynuilt, was a young joiner tasked with shuttering the machine roomrsquos giant horseshoe-shaped concrete roof.ldquoDump trucks came from nowhere, theyrsquod appear  feet in front of you. The noise was sore on your ears, like a vibration that would go on and on, he says.ldquoMe and my mate were working in a shaft that went up to the dam when a chap fell straight down. The guys said afterwards that the oil skins he was wearing had basically held him together.ldquoIt made you wonder what you were doing there.Handsome wages provided balance to the gruelling work and the gnawing fear.ldquoYou got an extra shilling an houryou were working in the tunnel,   moreyou were in the shaft, adds MacLean. ldquoAt the end of the week, Irsquod have pound in my pocket ndash my father in those days was only earning pound.Built to support Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations, Cruachan was intended to operate for short bursts to help juggle increases in demand. These days it is increasingly operating day as well as night.ldquoThe loss of coal-fired plants and the increase of more intermittent renewables such as wind and solar has meant the role of Cruachan and other stations like it have become more important than the original concept, explains Kinnaird.ldquoWe are seeing a changing landscape. Historically we were generating during the day, absorbing energy and pumping up to the reservoir at night.ldquoNowitrsquos windy during the day, we can be pumping during the day to save energy so the National Grid isnrsquot having to pay wind farms not to generate.ldquoWhen the wind dies down, we can release that energy back to the grid so itrsquos not being lost.In recent years, two of Cruachanrsquos four generator motor sets were virtually renewed and output boosted from MW each to MW.

Theyve given them everything from comedy to tragedy and straight-up drama. Above all, theyve given people a reason to keep coming back and find out what happens next.\"Theyre very clever in that they are standalone films, but with links. One film will throw up a strand that another picks up on. Fans love that kind of thing: it makes them feel asthey are part of a club, insiders.Like other critics, Rowat has noted the attention to detail in these superhero films. \"The most successful of these films are made by what you might call fan-boys who are steeped in the genre.\"In the new Endgame film, theres a lovely scene where all the Avengers are getting together again, and they go to Thors home. In the background you see this bottle of amber liquid and you think, Can that really be a bottle of Irn-Bru  And it is. Its that sort of attention to detail that makes you realise why these films are so beloved by the fans.\"The directors of Endgame, brothers Joe and Anthony Russo, have been taken aback by the success of the film. ldquoWe were definitely surprised. We knew the movie was good but you can never predict something like this, Anthony said last week. ldquoWith this kind of runaway success, the phrase standing on the shoulders of giants comes to mind, because the MCU has been building for so long. The audience has a depth of emotion for these characters.\"Not everyone, however, is in love with the MCU or with superhero films in general.Jodie Foster, for one. ldquoI worked  years to become a director, she has said. ldquoIt took me this long, and Irsquom going to make a superhero movie  I donrsquot think so.As Empire film magazine pointed out a few months ago, there are those who see Marvel Studios and the MCU as the epitome of everything that is wrong with modern blockbusters, and \"rail against the homogenisation of mass entertainment, and lay the blame for all the copycat shared universes and interlinked franchises that have sprung up in its wake.\"But that,\" Empire went on, \"almost wilfully ignores the creative success of these movies. Funny, thrilling, laced with great character work, a Marvel Studios movie ... is as surefire a guarantee of a good time at the movies as its possible to get.\"Fairy-tales for grown-upsTHE late Stan Lee upended the comic book industry in the s, creating Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and most of the Avengers, amongst other lastingly popular characters.In a  TEDx Gateway video talk, he said: \"For me, superheroes will always spark the imagination of people around the world, regardless of their background, because I think that people are always looking for something that represents the ideal person or the ideal situation.\"Almost all of us loved fairy-tales when we were young. Just remember stories of giants and witches and wizards and monsters and things that were so colourful and bigger than le. But then, you get a little older, and youre too old to read fairy-tales, but you never outgrow your love of that type of story. Andyou think about it, superhero stories today are really like fairy-tales for grown-ups. The characters are bigger than le, just like in fairy-tales. They have the same type of super-powers some can fly, some are extra-strong, some can be invisible....\"Game of thronesCOULD Avengers: Endgame go on to topple Avatar from its .bn all-time box-office record  It is just possible.As The Hollywood Reporter said this week: \"After making history and obliterating records across the globe, Avengers: Endgame is destined to become only the fth movie to clear  billion at the worldwide box office, not adjusted for inflation.\"The looming question now: Does the Disney and Marvel superhero pic have a shot at dethroning Avatars . billion and becoming the top-grossing movie of all time worldwide  Box office analysts say that would be a tough feat, but they arent ruling anything out after Endgame opened to a record-shattering . billion globally, including an unheard-of  million in North America and  million overseas. The international tally includes an all-time high of . million in China.\"Longer, better LIKE Superman and Spider-Man, Batman has proved irresistible over the decades to film-makers.Batman himself was the subject of four successful films between  and : Batman and Batman Returns, both directed by Tim Burton and with Michael Keaton as the caped crusader, squaring up to first Jack Nicholson then Danny DeVito Joel Schumachers Batman Forever, starring Val Kilmer and Schumachers Batman and Robin, with George Clooney and Chris ODonnell in the title roles.More recently, Batman was revived to considerable acclaim by Christopher Nolan, with Christian Bale taking the lead role in Batman Begins , The Dark Knightand The Dark Knight Rises . The last film is currently th in Box Office Mojos all-time list of worldwide top-grossing hits.As superhero films become longer and more ambitious, so too do they reflect the staggering improvements in computer graphics, with entire new virtual worlds opening up on the big screen and captivating millions of movie-goers. But there are film enthusiasts who argue that something has been lost amidst the spectacular special effects.\"That tends to ide people, actually,\" observes Alison Rowat.\" Youll get people who say the older superhero movies are the best ones because they were straightforward - the guy rescues the girl and they live happily ever after.\"Not everyone has got the patience to sit through them. Some think that the current crop maybe take themselves too seriously. They still do have their faults. Theres always a big fight scene at the end, which can be interminable.\"They keep getting longer and longer, too. Avengers: Endgame is three hours long and that is not to everyones taste either. I went to an am screening of Endgame and the cinema was pretty busy, but it was interesting that the three-hour run-time had quite a few people calling for aof the old intermissions.\"In the future ..ITS safe to say we have not yet seen the last of the superhero movie event. \"It can definitely go on because they have generated their own audience and they can keep going back to them,\" says Alison Rowat. \"But its like everything  - you need to be careful not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Already, yoursquove got older cinema-goers turning up at cinemas and thinking, oh no, not another superhero movie. But its all about constantly reinventing the genre. The great thing that is coming out of this Avengers series is Black Panther. That is very exciting and will get people coming back for more. The same goes for some of the women superheroes that theyve got coming along too. That will be the future, but it requires to be carefully done.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-criticised-after-calling-for-striking-workers-to-keep-the-noise-down","story":"Martyn Day raised concerns about ldquonoise disturbance during ldquounsociable hours during the dispute at the Bakkavor site in Borsquoness.However, the GMB union, which is representing the staff, hit back by saying that the only noise occurred during the working day.Staff at the plant, which is a major supplier of fresh produce to MS, have taken industrial action over what they regard as a ldquoderisory pay offer.Bakkavor have said that the .% increase is above inflation and have expressed disappointment at the unionrsquos actions.GMB members introduced an overtime ban in April, followed by three days of strike action.

The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"dying-to-tell-a-story-world-press-freedom-day","story":"Just over a week ago I was shot at, kidnapped, blindfolded, held captive and interrogated. Not for real you understand, though over the years as a reporter Irsquove experienced all this in real time. Instead, in this instance, I was undergoing what is known as Hostile Environment Training .For fully four days I was taught by ex-special forces soldiers and marines how among other things to treat traumatic wounds, identy improvised explosive devices , keep safe from cyber security threats and went through a mock kidnapping and detention that involved being blindfolded and put into stress position in a shipping container by masked armed men somewhere in a forest in rural England.In the woods outside, the flat pop pop of blank ammunition being fired from actual weapons as colleagues were summarily ldquoexecuted was at times chillingly real.I know this because years ago during the war in the former Yugoslavia I was lucky enough to actually survive just such an experience when the bullets were all too real and people died.Hostile environment training might sound like fun and a bit over the top, but itrsquos far from it. In many ways it has become a professional necessity for those journalists whose beat includes some of the more risky locations in the world. In many cases itrsquos now mandatory before such assignments can be embarked on.Alongside me on the course were colleagues from across the globe, representing news organisations like the BBC, ITN, NBC, CBS and CNN as well as freelancers like myself.Each and every one of us had our litany of stories about the threats and narrow escapes faced in the course of our work over the years.These stories and that of others took on a renewed resonance on Friday as those of us within the reporting trade marked World Press Freedom Day on May rd.This year like every year the event is gauged by the unavoidable reality that journalists round the world continue to work under attack. Perhaps at no time in recent memory has that been more the case than it is today.Writing a few days ago to mark the occasion, Michael Slackman, the international editor of the New York Times reminded readers of how we are living at a moment in history when democratic values are under threat by authoritarian leaders.ldquoThe internet, which holds such promise as a democratising force, has been co-opted by people peddling isive, hateful ideologies, he observed.ldquoCitizens around the world who want to speak out are under siege from their own governments, Slackman added, only just touching on the scale of the threat a free press now faces.One of the aims of World Press Freedom Day is to pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the field. Another is to assess the state of press freedom throughout the world. The World Press Freedom Index, compiled every year by Reporters Without Borders , does exactly that by evaluating the state of journalism in  countries.Only  per cent of those countries are classied as ldquogood. Norway ranks top of the list in terms of press freedom, with Turkmenistan at the bottom.According to the  Index: ldquoThe hostility towards journalists expressed by political leaders in many countries has incited increasingly serious and frequent acts of violence that have fuelled an unprecedented level of fear and danger for journalists.As of April , the International News Safety Institute reports that so far this year  journalists and media support staff have been killed and one citizen journalist. At the same time RSF counts  journalists,  citizen journalists and  media assistants as being imprisoned.Last year, a report on global freedom of expression by the British human rights group Article  found that media freedom was it is lowest point for a decade. This is the case no matter what region we look at, whether itrsquos the killing of nine journalist and two media workers in Mexico in , or the imprisonment of  journalists and counting in Turkey.More than half of those journalists behind bars are being held in Turkey, China, and Egypt, most of them on charges of opposing the state.This year, World Press Freedom Day comes less than a month after the murder of -year-old Lyra McKee in Northern Ireland. Itrsquos a sobering thought that she was only two-years-old when the United Nations established the annual event back in . Little could anyone have imagined that in such a comparatively short space of time the profession that McKee had chosen to take up would become under threat to the extent it is today.Indeed itrsquos a cruel irony that on the very eve of World Press Freedom Day in a country recognised as one of the most dangerous in the world for journalists there was yet another reminder of the human cost our profession often exacts.ldquoThey shot him in the mouth and heart, said the niece of reporter Telesforo Santiago Enriquez, who was attacked by gunmen last Thursday in the town of Juchitan, Oaxaca state in Mexico, where he founded the radio station El Cafetal.ldquoItrsquos absolutely horrying that this is how we have to go through a day when we should be thinking about the importance of media for a free and democratic society, said Jan-Albert Hootsen, Mexico representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists .Journalists in Mexico are in ldquoa state of constant siege that is worsening, he said.More than  journalists have been murdered in the country since , amid a wave of violence linked to drug trafficking and political corruption.Just days before he was shot Enriquez had received threats in an on-air phone call during his programme, in which he was known for reporting on corruption by local authorities. He was also well known for his work to preserve the regions indigenous languages and traditions.Frankly I find myself in awe at the courage of such colleagues in Mexico, one of whom shocked both instructors and fellow trainees alike with his terrying accounts of working in the country during his own hostile environment training on the UK course the week before my own.Enriquezrsquos fate sadly has become commonplace where too. Emboldened by the hostile rhetoric of world leaders like Donald Trump and his characterisation of critical comments as ldquofake news, and journalists as ldquothe enemy of the people, criminal gangs along with authoritarian governments and regimes worldwide are harassing, curtailing and jailing media workers at every turn.Itrsquos understandable of course that not everyone empathises with what journalists do.For years in the job Irsquove personally lost count of the times iniduals have rolled their eyes and given me contemptuous looks on hearing that I was ldquoone of those people.As a journalist, I like many colleagues have often been regarded as being about as worthy as something you would scrape off the sole of your shoe. In some instances such responses, I freely admit, were only a result of our own making by some within the profession.At its worst the media can be intrusive, lurid and vacuous or so beholden to political or commercial power that it becomes not so much unworthy as downright dangerous. To that end we need to keep our own house in order and accountable.ldquoWe have a responsibility to the audiences we serve and to the wider public to be truthful and accountable, transparent and independent, says Hannah Storm director of the Ethical Journalism Network.As journalists we need to root our work in humanity and the basic principles of ethical journalism observes Storm, as we educate others and ourselves about the role of journalists and what is at stake when press freedom suffers.Personally Irsquove always felt that the media at its negative worst has to been seen in context and offset against the wider undeniable good that a free press brings.Part of this wider good is the search for justice says Christian Christensen, Professor of Journalism at Stockholm University in Sweden.ldquoSome of the very best journalism exposes injustice, and leads to rectication of that injustice. Some people will say that this strays over into ldquoactivism. But, given that justice is about fundamental fairness and the rejection of the exploitation of the less powerful by the more powerful, I see no contradiction, Christensen insists.Good journalism also questions power, he argues. A truly free and independent press is a fundamental tool for holding those in and with power, #be it political, economic or social#to account. To that end too a vibrant, critical, free press is absolutely fundamental to a ing democracy.As a reporter who has spent most of his working le covering foreign affairs, Irsquove also always been of the view that good international reporting matters.Our personal experiences of the outside world can be very limited, so the power of journalism to ldquoframe global politics for us cannot be underestimated. Such reporting doesnrsquot just tell us what happens abroad, it also explains broader international causes and implications of those events.With that in mind, those who spend much of their time criticising the press might do well to pause for a moment and consider the implications of the question, whatno one were watching In his eloquent essay in the New York Times last week international editor Michael Slackman, summed this is up perfectly.ldquoImagineThe Times were not able to report from Venezuela. The government there has tried to keep us out and has attacked our correspondents for their reporting because there is something it doesnrsquot want you to know: Infants in Venezuela are dying of malnutrition, asked Slackman.ldquoImaginewe were not in Yemen, where a Saudi-led military coalition has prompted the worldrsquos worst humanitarian disaster.Imaginewe were not in Mexico to reveal how the previous government used advanced spyware to attack and undermine civil society.All these were stories that his newspaper the New York Times and others covered and in doing so they make a dference by initiating change for the good be it great or small.Take for example the banning of the material that caused the Grenfell Tower to burn so quickly after the investigative reporting of newspapers or the Panama Papers exposure of the rogue offshore finance industry.On another level there was the New York Times report from South Africa that two children had drowned in the rudimentary latrines dug into the ground at their schools that resulted in the president announcing a programme to tackle the issue.These examples and many more stand as testimony as to why a free press is vital.As part of his decision to make global media freedom his priority in  and ahead of an international media freedom conference next month, British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has appointed international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney as his special envoy on media freedom.While Britainrsquos move is commendable, the UK government might perhaps start by taking note that this yearrsquos World Press Freedom Index places the UK in rd place, one of the worst ranked countries in Western Europe.While itrsquos a rise of seven places on last year, Britain still stands behind Germany , Spainand France . The UK also now ranks below countries like Ghana, Latvia, Surinam, Jamaica and South Africa. It can perhaps take some solace however from the news that it still rates better than the US which fell three places to th.Britainrsquos initiative to improve global media press freedom is to be applauded, but it would be naive to assume that press freedom can be secured by one government alone and particularly one with other political priorities and problems.In a world awash in information, bearing personal witness has become even more important. That is why World Press Freedom Day resonates this year, perhaps more than in the past.Three years from now I will be expected to undergo a ldquorefresher of my hostile environment training. Herersquos hoping the world is a safer place for my colleagues by then. Personally, I doubt it."},{"url":null,"title":"six-scottish-summer-walks","story":"This hike gives you a sense of Scotlandrsquos split personality.

There are sheep there but they are fenced off.The walk is steep in places, especially on the section that takes you on to the top of the crags and is only suitable for fitter walkers.The walk will take between two and three hours.Garry ScottLargs PromenadeYou wont need fancy boots or a rucksack, though a wind and waterproof jacket can often be essential for surviving this daunder along the jewel in the Clyde Coastrsquos crown. And unlike many excursions itrsquos impossible to get lost.Easily accessible via car or train , the broad ribbon links Aubrey Crescent in the north end of the town with Largs Yacht Haven in the south, making a four-and-a-half mile round trip.Whichever way you tackle the route yoursquore never far from history ndash whether the blonde sandstone villa Vanduara, where key decisions over the D-Day landings were taken, or the Pencil, a monument to the  Battle of Largs ndash and while the seafront has changed hugely since this correspondent was a boy it retains a large measure of impregnability, not least in the well-cared-for churches that dominate the town and the many grand properties which have stared impassively out to Cumbrae and beyond since the Victorian era.Sean Guthrie:The  most interesting gardens to visit in ScotlandCumnock to Dumfries House, AyrshireThe great joy of this walk  The constant contrasts: urban and rural, river and woodland, past and future. Start at the leisure centre on Auchinleck Road in Cumnock before following the path to the River Lugar.Cumnock is the capital of Ayrshires industrial history and youll see plenty of evidence of it, including the hoist of the former Barony mine on the horizon, like a giant letter A.Keep following the path and youll weave through woodland, before reaching the Dumfries House estate, which was saved by Prince Charles. At the top of the road, turn left and youre at the long, straight Duchess of Rothesay Avenue. The road in Oz was yellow but this one is bright, bright red.Keep going and the path will take you back through the estate and you can follow the river back to your starting point.Mark SmithThe Whangie, near DrymenSURELY one of the best things about Scotland is that even when you live in a big town or city, you are never far away from proper hills and countryside.Its becoming something of an annual tradition for me to do a walk up the Whangie, that funny-sounding rock feature in the Kilpatrick Hills, near Drymen, that offers wonderful views towards Loch Lomond, the southern highlands and the Campsies.Legend has it that the m stone corridor, which forms part of the walk up to Queens View, was created by the devil when he flicked his tale in delight, though geologists insist an earthquake or glacier is more likely responsible. The strange eeriness of the rocks ndash which youngsters love to run through ndash adds genuine wonder to the very doable walk up the grassy hill.At the summit, theres a cairn, and as you survey the lochs and glens below, the dark mountains in the distance, I always feel fortied.Marianne TaylorThe Necropolis, GlasgowOn a clear day the views are superb and it is rare I meander through the quiet paths without discovering something I havenrsquot seen before.The Necropolis, a sprawling -acre Victorian cemetery to the east of Glasgow Cathedral, is the final resting place of more than , people.Rather than crossing the bridge from the cathedral and entering that way, go to the gate at the southwest corner, just before Wishart Street intersects with John Knox Street.Follow the path as it gradually climbs, then grows steeper, towards the summit of the hill where many of the larger monuments are clustered. Trees line the route including oak, silver birch, sycamore and maple.The Necropolis is home to tombs, sculptures, marble busts and Art Nouveau portrait . The pedigree is impressive with many designed by leading lights of architecture such as Alexander ldquoGreek Thomson, John Bryce, David Hamilton and Charles Rennie Mackintosh.Look out for the memorial to Wee Willie Winkie poet William Miller and the stunning Archibald Douglas Monteath Mausoleum, a circular temple building with elaborate stone carvings. You can walk round in  minutes or stay for several hours.Susan Swarbrick:The  most interesting gardens to visit in ScotlandThe Forth and Clyde Canal Union Canal, FalkirkYou can cross countries, cross continents, to find a good walk. Or you can just go out of your front door. I tend to the lazier version. Up, round, down, up again, a scramble and a slither on to the bank and there is the Forth  Clyde Canal racing on ahead of me up to Lock  and beyond. Beyond being the Falkirk Wheel.Cirrus and contrails apart, the sky burns blue as I slip and slither along to the swing bridge that takes me across to the Wheel.Turn right and I could walk to Rough Castle where Roman centurions guarded the Antonine Wall. But normally I cut through the Rough Castle Tunnel and climb up to the Union Canal, ldquothe midpoint between Glasgow and Edinburgh a sign notes.This is my favourite bit of the walk. Tamfourhill and the train line on one side, moors, sheep and empty sky on the other. On good days, I think, I could walk on to Linlithgow. Maybe even Edinburgh. The Union Canal ends not so very far from the Filmhouse, after all.But usually I donrsquot quite make it as far as Falkirk High.

We donrsquot have a level digital playing field and this really must be sorted out.Susan Quinn, convener of the education committee of the Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union, warned that the technology should not be used to replace traditional face-to-face teaching.ldquoWe recognise that this sort of remote teaching is being used in rural areas, but we have concerns about that being rolled out to a wider group. It really should be for distance situations rather than just because a council cannot recruit a teacher, she said.ldquoHaving  pupils in a class in Glasgow being taught through a video link by a teacher in a classroom with another  pupils in front of them is not something that we think is workable or practical. The best way of improving opportunities for pupils in a range of subjects is to recruit specialist teachers.Laura Gordon, headteacher of the Highland Virtual Academy, said the technology worked well with no negative impact on results.The initiative, which uses a video conferencing app, was established three years ago to enhance the curriculum for schools across the Highlands.Ms Gordon said: ldquoWe have lots of smaller schools on the north and west coast that donrsquot have the same provision as our larger schools because they just donrsquot have the staffing.ldquoWe wanted everyone to have access to all the courses available in our larger schools so the virtual academy was set up. We now have up to  pupils studying courses and we have  applications for next year.Under the model, the academy runs a set programme of National, Higher and Advanced Higher courses every year.They have found class sizes work best when there are no more than  pupils logging in to a session to allow teachers to fully interact with everyone logged on.So far results have been just as good as face-to-face lessons ndash and in some cases outcomes have been even better.ldquoEngagement with pupils is good because pupils are under the spotlight more, the class sizes are smaller and all the learning is collaborative and active so there isnrsquot an opportunity not to engage. Some of our results last year were better than faceto-face teaching, but the pupils have to have the independent learning skills in order to benefit from it.Last month, a report by the Reform Scotland think-tank found the number of National  and National  qualications on offer is in decline.A majority of schools now only offer six subjects in the fourth year of secondary school compared to eight or nine a few years ago.In contrast, private schools are continuing to offer up to nine. The Scottish Government argues Curriculum for Excellenceprovides greater flexibility and allows schools to design a more tailored education for pupils ndash including courses that donrsquot necessarily result in formal qualications.Because more pupils are staying on until sixth year, ministers argue that gives them more time to study qualications as they move up through school."},{"url":null,"title":"charities welcome mither tap walk","story":"Two breast cancer charities have welcomed the launch of an upcoming walk on Bennachie.The charities have said that money raised by the hike to the peak of Mither Tap will help fund hope for the future.The event, known as MT , will set off from the Back of Bennachie car park to just under the peak of Mither Tap.The walk will take place on Sunday, June .

I want it to work in the best interests of the whole of the UK. That’s why I was in Aberdeen yesterday to discuss this directly with businesses.I want to explain why I think this ambitious and pro-business blueprint will drive up wages and boost the Scottish economy.We will scrap the cap on the number of skilled professionals who can come to Scotland. We will also abolish the outdated requirement to advertise jobs in the UK for a month before hiring from overseas for highly skilled workers.This means that hospitals, oil rigs, banks, tech firms and other organisations will be able to access the talent and skills they need from all corners of the world.As part of our new system, we will widen the definition of skilled workers to allow more people who will add value to our businesses and economy to be eligible to enter. Anyone with the equivalent of Scottish Highers will be eligible to apply under the new skilled workers route.: Why Scotland must create ‘friendly environment’ for migrants – leader commentAnd there will continue to be no limit on the number of international students who can come to study at Scotland’s world-class universities – such as St Andrews, which was ranked in the UK’s top three universities just a few days ago.It’s vital we have a constant pool of foreign talent coming into the country, which is why we are introducing measures to make our universities even more attractive for prospective students. Under the new scheme, undergrads and postgrads studying at Scottish universities will be able to stay for six months after finishing their degrees to find work. Those who have completed a PhD will be able to stay for a year.As part of this ambitious plan, we are speaking to businesses, employers and partners right across Scotland to listen and ensure the new immigration system works for them. Yesterday in Aberdeen, I spoke to business leaders from the thriving industries of energy, fishing and agriculture. We’ve met hundreds of stakeholders so far this year, and we will have met thousands by the time we introduce the new immigration system in . We’ve also set up advisory groups, involving the Scottish Government, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Universities Scotland and others. We have had detailed discussions about how this will work in practice.Although  may seem like a long way off, I’ve already made changes to make the UK more welcoming since becoming Home Secretary a year ago. I removed the cap on doctors and nurses coming to the UK so our NHS could recruit as many as they need – creating thousands of extra places for other sectors too.: Brexit: Nicola Sturgeon brands Theresa May ‘disgraceful’ after EU immigration commentsI announced reforms to help the most innovative entrepreneurs and investors come to Scotland and where in the UK. And I’ve made it easier for top architects and international researchers to bring their expertise.We’re also making it quicker for tourists arriving at Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports to enter by introducing by the summer of this year e-Gates for travellers from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States, which allow visitors to pass quickly and securely through border controls.We remain a truly welcoming nation – and that welcome extends to the more than , EU nationals who have made Scotland their home. We’re helping to protect their rights through the EU Settlement Scheme, which we have made as easy as possible to use.These people are our friends, neighbours and colleagues. We want them to stay and are doing everything in our power to get it right.Scotland also has a proud heritage and has a long history of being an open and welcoming nation as well as a trading nation. It exports products which are in global demand, from Scotch whisky to Scottish salmon and much more. I believe the new immigration system will help Scotland invest in the skills it needs to continue to thrive, driving productivity because it is built around the skills that people bring – not where they come from. It will have fairness and compassion at its heart, and I am confident that it will ensure Scotland continues to prosper for many years to come.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"labour doesn t trust may after brexit talks leak","story":"Theresa May has #blown the confidentiality# of cross-party Brexit talks and no longer has the trust of the Labour Party, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said as senior opposition figures cast doubt on an agreement to break the deadlock being reached this week.Mr McDonnell said any deal with the Conservatives would have to give MPs a vote on holding a referendum with the option to remain in the EU, as shadow cabinet colleagues said it would be “very dficult” to reach an agreement at all.The government has said talks between the two parties must conclude by midweek in order to avoid European elections at the end of the month. If a compromise deal based on continued membership of the EU customs union remains out of reach, further indicative votes in the Commons may need to be held.Following devastating local election results, the Prime Minister issued a plea to MPs urging them to “break the deadlock” and get a Brexit deal through parliament.The Prime Minister said she understood why Tory MPs found the decision to hold talks with Labour “uncomfortable”, and admitted it was not what she wanted either. But she said the crushing blow voters delivered on both parties at the ballot box had given “fresh urgency” to the need to end the impasse.Mrs May urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to work with her to reach a deal, writing in the Mail on Sunday: “To the leader of the opposition, I say this: let’s listen to what the voters said in the elections and put our dferences aside for a moment. Let’s do a deal.”And the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson added her voice to appeals for compromise. “We’ve gotten pretty close, we’re getting closer and closer to where that middle ground might be,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. “I would urge my colleagues in the House of Commons to start taking those first steps to walk back to something in the middle because we need to allow the country to move on.”But Mr McDonnell played down hope of a breakthrough, accusing Mrs May of jeopardising cross-party talks for her own “personal protection”.Following newspaper reports that Mrs May is preparing to give ground this week in the discussions, the Labour frontbencher said the PM had “blown the confidentiality” of the negotiations.He said his party wanted to get a deal done “as soon as possible” but needed guarantees that an agreement would not be “ripped up” by a future Conservative leader.Mr McDonnell accused Mrs May of acting in “bad faith” after the Sunday Times reported that the Prime Minister would put forward plans for a comprehensive but temporary customs arrangement with the EU that would last until the next general election.Mr McDonnell said it “may well” be the case that any deal would have to be voted on in a second referendum, adding: “I think the Conservatives have to recognise thata deal is going to go through there might be a large number of MPs who will want a public vote.”Earlier, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it was “disappointing” that it appeared Tory ministers and spin doctors had been “briefing about what’s happening” in the talks.And Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson said it would be “very dficult” to agree a deal in the cross-party talks.A letter signed by  opposition MPs, including dozens of Labour parliamentarians as well as senior figures in the SNP and Liberal Democrats, warned Mr Corbyn against agreeing a deal without a second referendum.“The very worst thing we could do at this time is a Westminster stitch up,” the letter says. “This risks alienating those who voted leave in  and those who voted remain.”Elsewhere, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage warned Mrs May against agreeing to stay in the EU customs union, telling thethat she would be “going into coalition with the opposition against the people”.Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the  committee of Tory backbenchers, told the same paper that staying in a customs union could lead to a “catastrophic split” in the party at a time when Labour is led by “dangerous extremists”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove unveils plans to take control of holyrood cash","story":"Radical plans to hold back tens of millions of pounds from Holyrood and allow UK ministers instead to spend the cash directly north of the Border have been set out by environment secretary Michael Gove.The Scots-born MP is among the front-runners to replace Theresa May when she stands down.He insists his plan for Westminster to be allowed to spend Treasury funding in traditionally devolved areas would strengthen the Union.It could see Westminster funding projects in areas such as education and farming.The plan would also tackle unrest at Westminster over the Scottish Government’s claim that it alone “speaks for Scotland”.“There’s a rule that we’re currently bound by, a Treasury rule which means that the UK Government can’t spend money in areas that are devolved,” Mr Gove told a fringe event at the Tory conference yesterday.“So that means when it comes to promoting culture or supporting agriculture and fisheries, the money has to go through the Scottish Government.“I think that once we’ve given the Scottish Government their fair share, the UK Government should be able to spend additional money on the basis of need for projects that will strengthen the Union.” Mr Gove said every government department thinks of itself as a UK department.Speaking during a question-and-answer session with Stirling MP Stephen Kerr, Mr Gove also hinted UK ministers could start spending in devolved areas.“The department of education deals primarily with schools in England, but actually the strength of our knowledge base across the United Kingdom matters. “There are English students in Scottish Universities and there are Scottish academics in English Universities- we need to make sure that the money that we spend and the initiatives that we carry out here are badged as UK Government.“The Scottish Government is very good at using money that it gets form Westminster to claim it is delivering them - actually it is the UK Government that is providing this and leading the way on budgets.”He hinted that more Scottish MPs would be handed ministerial roleshe replaces Theresa May“We shouldmake sure the Westminster government is seen as representative of every part of the United Kingdom and we’re prepared to energetically say to the SNP ‘You don’t speak for Scotland.’”“The whole idea that you say you are the Scottish Government and therefore you are the only legitimate voice that speaks for Scotland is wrong.“Of course we respect the devolution settlement and we respect their capacity to make policy as long they have a majority.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll majority of scots don t want new currency in independent scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A new poll has found only one in seven Scots would like to see an independent Scotland with a new currency.The Panelbase survey of , Scottish voters, commissioned by The Sunday Times, found  per cent of voters would favour keeping the pound in a currency union with the rest of UK compared to  per cent who would prefer a new currency.

I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner # lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing.

However, Paul, whose own flat is covered in damp, has called for them to be levelled.“I lived in a damp flat here, which I walked out of  years ago because it was that bad. I told them just to board the place up,” he said.“I walked out of a two-bedroom flat into this bedroom so that I could get to see my kids.  years on and things are getting just as bad.“The issues are just non-stop. I’ve got  points and I’m here  years. Corrib Flats are being pulled down and they’re building new houses, which is what needs to happen here.“They spent £ million to fix the flats and all I got out of it was a new front and back door. These flats need trailed down – it’s like living in a slum. They could refurbish these whole flats and it still wouldn’t do any good. We have old Economy  heating systems. In three months, I’ve put nearly £ into the heating. The guy that came out to look at it said that I was pumping money into nothing. We were supposed to be getting gas in in February, but February has been and gone, and they’re saying it will be July August time. I know July August is going to come and go as well. We’re just being told lies all over again.”A Housing Executive spokesperson said: “Upgrade works totalling over £million are under way in the Upper Lenadoon area and at Carrigart Flats.“This work includes repairs and redecoration to stairwells, new door sets, some window replacements, along with a new secure storage unit for bins and refuge.“There is also extensive works to alleviate water ingress on the top floor flats balconies.“New pathways are also being installed to deal with traditional problems of water ponding.“Tenants have been fully consulted on this work and it has been welcomed by local representatives.“We also wrote to our tenants recently informing them that survey work in relation to a new heating system would commence this week.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"friends to walk from belfast to derry for lyra","story":"A -mile walk from Belfast to Derry will take place later this month in memory of murdered North Belfast journalist Lyra McKee.The -year-old was killed by the New IRA after shots were fired during disturbances in the Creggan estate in Derry on April .The walk has been organised by a group ofpeople who want Lyra’s murder to be the last Troubles-related death in the North as well as an opportunity to reassert the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Conall McCorry, a friend of Lyra’s, who also helped organise the vigil at Belfast City Hall after her death, has teamed up with Susan Curran, whose idea it was for the walk, and Brenda Gough, who is organising the logistics of the walk.“Lyra was my friend,” said Conall. “We met through work a few years ago and became friends. We were a support network for each other really.“I knew everything was going well for her le. Her partner Sara meant I never had to worry about Lyra. Everything was in place for her and it is really bad her le has been ended so quickly.”Conall was contacted after the vigil by Susan Curran, who came up with the idea of the walk.“The idea came about quite spontaneously the night after Lyra’s killing in a conversation I had with Conall,” she said.“Conall had organised the vigil but I was late in work that night and really gutted that I missed it. “The idea came in my head of a walk from Belfast to Derry. I just said to Conall let’s do it!“I was just overcome with anger about what happened and fear that we were going back to that.“We are just a group of people who want to react and take action. I have legs, a voice and a heart and that is all I need for the walk.“Everyone can take part in the walk in any way they can. We would ask people to challenge themselves. We are asking people to ‘Be more Lyra’.“Our message to people who don’t support us is for them to be honest with themselves and realise the majority of people who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement.“We don’t want any more young people in graves or swayed by violence. We want Lyra’s death to be the last Troubles-related death in our society.“Through the walk, we want to demonstrate the will of the majority of people in our society to reject violence as a means to resolving our issues.“We want to rejuvenate and bring new le into the principles of the Good Friday Agreement which has been broken time and time again. As ordinary people in society, we are fully behind it.“We have very real memories of the Troubles and we don’t want a repeat for our children and our children’s children.“We believe Lyra’s death will be a catalyst for change. This is our generation’s peace walk.”The walk will leave Writer’s Square in Belfast at am on Saturday, May  to walk the  miles to Moneymick in Randalstown for the first camp.On Sunday , walkers will depart at am to walk  miles to Dungiven for the second stop over before completing the last  miles on Mondayto Guildhall in Derry.Brenda Gough is encouraging people to get involved in whatever way they can.“Over  people have registered. People want to get involved in whatever way they can, evenit isn’t actually doing the walk.“We have Lyra’s partner, Sara’s blessing to start from Writer’s Square because Lyra was a writer of course.“At the campsites, we want people to talk to each other and facilitate the dficult conversations.“Everything is in motion when it comes to the logistics. People will be safe and comfortable from tents to shower facilities and providing tea and coffee.

The play tells of the journey of two Belfast women set against the backdrop of the crumbling Floral Hall as they recall the fateful night they met their future musician husbands. Old grudges and sparks fly as they reminisce about the lestyles of their globetrotting other halves who experienced fame and fortune while the wives they left behind struggled to bring up their young families, working all day and spending countless lonely nights. Written and directed by Brenda Winter-Palmer, the production has been developed by West Belfast actress Antoinette Morelli, daughter of showband legend Tony. Inbetween a quick rehearsal break, Antoinette spoke passionately to the Andersonstown News about how she has haboured the project for the past  years and how proud she is to see it come to fruition on The MAC stage next week. “I’m in a wee bit of shock and obviously incredibly excited that it’s got to this stage,” she said. “Brenda had heard my story about daddy and it turned out that Brenda’s daddy was Micky Conlon, a big concert promoter at that time. I commissioned Brenda three years ago to write the piece.“We had a read through last year in the Strand cinema as part of the Eastside Arts festival. David Hull the promoter was invited, he picked it up and this is where we are.”Antoinette plays the character of Rose, “a character that has been inspired by mum’s stories but is not my mum”. “The story is fictionalised and it’s about two couples, two sisters and the impact the showbands have on their lives,” she said. Antoinette continued: “With the Miami Showband story out this year and this production the stories are similar in terms of the showband connection but this is very much from the women’s perspective. “It’s tragic, it’s funny, there are a lot of good treats in there with music from the showband era. The universal heartbeat of the play is our story, the sacrices women made to let their men go off and pursue their dreams. “The Floral Hall is almost its own character in the play, after last year’s reading we had so many people come up to say ‘oh we met there’, people have such good memories of the place.“I know how dficult it is now, in terms of performing, first hand, as my husband is a stay-at-home dad to our -year-old and -month-old. If it wasn’t for him doing that I couldn’t pursue my career so I’m lucky that is he very supportive. I definitely think people will identy with the show.”Keep Telling Me Lies will be performed at The MAC theatre from Thursday May  until Sunday May .

When she spotted the attempted fraud, she checked the banks website for guidance and made contact via telephone as instructed, with the help of her brother.She said the employee who took the call refused her service as she was using her brother as an intermediary on the call.Ms McKendry explained: \"I asked my brother to explain my disability and to ask for a reasonable adjustment to enable me to act quickly on fraudulent activity on my bank account. \"I didnt want my brother to act for me, I wanted him to relay the instructions of the bank employee to me and I would respond via the speaker phone.\"Even though the bank employee said he could hear me, the account holder, he refused me service because I was lip-reading the information the employee provided to my brother via speaker phone. \"I could see attempted transactions happening on my account while this call was ongoing and was extremely worried.\" The bank had blocked the card immediately after her phone call, but following what she saw as a refusal of service, Ms McKendry contacted her bank via secure messaging on its online app. The app said it could take three to five days or more to get a response.Ms McKendry felt the situation was more urgent.The next morning she was invited to meet the branch manager who confirmed that her card had been blocked following her call, her account was safe and missing funds would be reinstated. The manager suggested putting in place a mandate that would give her brother access and transaction rights to her accounts. Ms McKendry rejected this, saying she is well capable of managing her financial affairs herself.She made a formal complaint to Danske Bank and contacted the Equality Commission.A disability discrimination case was taken against Northern Bank Ltd, which trades as Danske Bank, with the help of the Equality Commission.In settling the case, Northern Bank Ltd paid Ms McKendry £, without admission of liability, and has made adjustments to its services.Ms McKendry said she found the episode \"hugely frustrating\" and welcomed the banks move to put in place technology she can use to contact it in a hurry.Danske Bank said: \"Our award-winning local contact centre has since invested in market leading voice biometrics technology to help customers more easily identy themselves securely. \"We have been happy to work with Ms McKendry and the Equality Commission to help deliver better outcomes. \"We also recently became the only company in Northern Ireland to sign up to The Valuable , a global movement of organisations who pledge to promote disability inclusion and place it on the board agenda in .\""},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp paisleys poach tourists from dublin call sparks backlash","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Addressing delegates from Visit Belfast and Visit Derry at Westminster, Mr Paisley suggested that Dublin was unfairly marketing on this side of border.Read MoreIan Paisley: Without aggressive strategy well always be second bestIan Paisleys ‘ranting and raving’ will turn US visitors off, says travel expertHe askedNorthern Ireland should \"put it right back in their face\".\"Its been put to me that % of Dublin Airports marketing budget on the island is spent in Northern Ireland to attract people to go south,\" Mr Paisley said.\"Im just wondering, should we have an aggressive marketing strategy that says whenever you get off a plane in Dublin, Visit Derry, visit Belfast, visit the Causeway, why arent you going north  and put it right back in their face \"The song most Americans sing is Danny Boy - thats nothing to do with the Republic of Ireland, its to do with Northern Ireland.\"Why dont we have an aggressive strategy that tells every single Irish-American in Dublin, Youre in the wrong part of the island, you need to be up north.\"His comments were made at a meeting of the NI Affairs Committee, which has started an inquiry into tourism in Northern Ireland, and have sparked debate.Last night SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone, a former chair of Stormonts enterprise, trade and investment committee, said Mr Paisley was in no position to lecture on tourism.He referred to the MPs suspension from the House of Commons for  days last year for \"serious misconduct\" after failing to declare family holidays to Sri Lanka in . In December Mr Paisley also faced questions over a luxury trip to the Males. data-dfpadtargetingTourists at Dunluce CastleMr McGlone added: \"Its nice to see Mr Paisleys recent tourist trips to Sri Lanka and the Males have helped him become such an expert in tourism.\"But perhaps he could have been warned that such ill-advised comments would only draw more attention to those overseas trips.\"The tourism industry will always work hard to attract as many visitors to Ireland both north and south, and we welcome all to these shores.\"I wonder how many times Mr Paisley has flown out from Dublin Airport since hes so aware of the lack of marketing for Northern Ireland \"Most visitors from overseas have no choice but to land in Dublinthey want to visit. Telling them theyve landed in the wrong place is not the message we should be putting out.\"Sinn Fein said that \"clearly Ian Paisley has a great deal of experience of tourism and overseas travel... but he obviously knows nothing about marketing\".\"Tourists from across the world see Ireland as a single entity and it is rightly marketed as such,\" it said.\"His comments also show a lack of understanding of the north-south bodies which his party colleagues sat on which have responsibility for all-Ireland tourism marketing.\"Hospitality NI chief Colin Neill said that something has to be done to ensure Northern Ireland maximises its tourist potential.However, he admitted Mr Paisleys words was \"not the sort of language I would have used\".\"The Republic of Ireland is our second biggest market behind Great Britain,\" he said.\"Around % of air traffic of visitors to Northern Ireland comes through Dublin Airport, so yes, we need to do everything we can to make sure they turn left as well as right after they arrive.\"But theres a bigger issue and that concerns infrastructure in Northern Ireland.\"We have to do more to attract international flights to Belfast airports. Ways of bringing visitors directly into Northern Ireland have to be addressed.\"He called for reductions in air passenger duty and the development of new routes as tourism here \"could be missing out on as much as £bn a year\".\"Its easier to keep people in Northern Irelandthey arrive at one of our airports in the first place,\" he said.Gerry Lennon from Visit Belfast and Odhran Dunne from Visit Derry appeared before MPs at yesterdays Westminster committee hearing. Both agreed that more marketing was essential, but warned that resources were tight and more public sector funding is needed.Tourism NI, the organisation which handles marketing in the Republic, said it was not in a position to comment as it would be contributing to the committee at a later date.Tourism Ireland is the body responsible for marketing overseas."},{"url":null,"title":"dup welcome unexpected arrival in election excitement","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, in a statement issued on Saturday the Fine Gael leader said he made the comments because of “conflicting accounts”. He said: “On the one hand, a letter from four consultants making deeply disturbing claims about conditions in the mortuary and on the other hand, a statement from hospital management saying there was no evidence or supporting complaints to back up the claims. “I did not want to jump to conclusions or to side with one group of staff against another without knowing facts or before an investigation was carried out. “That’s why I said that I did not knowthe claims were true or not.“Over the course of the week, corroborating statements have come to light and complaints have been made that I believe support the views expressed by the four consultants. This is one I got wrong.“I want to apologise unreservedly to anyone who feels that I did not treat this issue with the seriousness or sensitivity it deserved.“As I have said before, my over-riding concern is for the dignity of patients in le and in death. “It has never been in dispute that the mortuary is sub-standard and needs to be replaced.”He added that planning permission has been granted for a new mortuary at the hospital while temporary measures are being put in place in the interim.

He said his party wanted to get a deal done “as soon as possible” but needed guarantees that an agreement would not be “ripped up” by a future Conservative leader.#Marr: “Do you trust the prime minister ” Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell: “No… she’s blown the confidentiality… she’s jeopardised the negotiations” #Brexit https:t.co vNrEbYJB pic IRInyQro— BBC PoliticsMay , And asked on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Showhe trusted Mrs May, he replied: “No, sorry, not after this weekend when she’s blown the confidentiality I had and I actually think she’s jeopardised the negotiations for her own personal protection.”Mr McDonnell accused Mrs May of acting in “bad faith” after the Sunday Times reported that the Prime Minister would put forward plans for a comprehensive but temporary customs arrangement with the EU that would last until the next general election.And he said: “We are negotiating with Theresa May’s team as requested. Whilst we’re doing that and we think we’re gaining an understanding of our dferent positions and where we can reach some compromise, in the wings,you like, are all the leadership candidates virtually threatening to tear up whatever deal that we do.“Disappointing… an act of bad faith” Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell accuses the government of “undermining” the cross-party #Brexit talks by “breaking confidentiality” #Marr https:t.co vNrEbYJB pic rTigvtKiV— BBC PoliticsMay , “So we’re dealing with a very unstable Government and let me just use this analogy: it’s trying to enter into a contract with a company that’s going into administration and the people who are going to take over are not willing to fulfil that contract. We can’t negotiate like that.”Mr McDonnell also said it “may well” be the case that any deal would have to be voted on in a second referendum, adding: “I think the Conservatives have to recognise thata deal is going to go through there might be a large number of MPs who will want a public vote.”Earlier, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it was “disappointing” that it appeared Tory ministers and spin doctors had been “briefing about what’s happening” in the talks. “We’ve entered these negotiations in good faith – they should be confidential at this stage becauseyou want to get an agreement you have to be able to respect the position of those sat around the table and we seem to be reading all kinds of things in the newspapers today,” he told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday.“I would say to those Tories negotiating this isn’t really the best way to go about it to be frank.”Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson said it would be “very dficult” to agree a deal in the cross-party talks.“Obviously for a large number of our colleagues a confirmatory ballot on a deal is a deal breaker. Now it might be we find some form of deal that diminishes that desire but it will be very hard to achieve and only time will tell on that,” he told BBC Radio  Live’s Pienaar’s Politics.“But I don’t think we should give  hope on this, it’s going to be very dficult to find a negotiated settlement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"may urges corbyn to work with government to agree brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We’ve got to be able to stretch all the way from Ken Clarke right the way through to Jacob Rees-Mogg.”He also confirmed that he would run to be the next prime minister when Mrs May stands down, but said: “I am now so excited to be the International Development Secretary.”To the leader of the opposition, I say this: lets listen to what the voters said in the elections and put our dferences aside for a momentTheresa MayThe Prime Minister, writing in the Mail on Sunday, issued a rallying cry to MPs urging them to support cross-party efforts to “break the deadlock” and get a deal through the Commons.She said she understood why some of her colleagues found the decision to hold talks with Labour “uncomfortable”, and admitted it was not what she wanted either.But she said the crushing blow voters delivered on both parties at the local elections had given “fresh urgency” to the need to end the impasse.“To the leader of the opposition, I say this: let’s listen to what the voters said in the elections and put our dferences aside for a moment.

Cllr Curran said space in an existing refrigeration unit is exhausted and more is required.Meanwhile, former South Down MP, Margaret Ritchie, who recently visited Ardglass, is also pleased that local fishermen can now fish in Dundalk Bay.She thanked the Minister for Fisheries and Marine in Dublin, political colleagues in Daacuteil Eacuteireann and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood for making representations to ensure legislation was enacted.She added: ldquoThis will ensure that fishing, which is the leblood of the Ardglass community, can continue unhindered. This is also good news for the local economy.Development plans for Ardglass include relocating Ardglass trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the village harbour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Artist chosen to display work at renowned exhibition in Dublin  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK artist who is the youngest ever member of the Ulster Water Colour Society is to exhibit in Irelandrsquos biggest and most prestigious art exhibition next month.Connor Maguire has recently been selected to show his self-portrait entitled lsquoMan in the Hatrsquo at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It will be the second time he has been chosen to exhibit along with Irelandrsquos finest artists.The  year-old mdash who is a former De La Salle High student mdash says his painting is a side profile piece which was completed in oils on canvas. Out of a total of , entries submitted to the exhibition, only  or so are successful.Connor was shortlisted last year for the Zurich Portrait prize where he was only one of  artists throughout Ireland to be up for a winning prize of two thousand euros.This gave him the opportunity to exhibit in the National Gallery of Ireland which he describes as being ldquosurreal and a dream come true.Connor said: ldquoOne of my earliest memories is of me scribbling away at a table with my grandfather, Broderick Maguire.ldquoMy grandfather, an accomplished draughtsman, carpenter, designer and painter, could do anything that he applied himself to and introduced me to pencil drawing and charcoal. He inspired and captivated me, seeing what he could accomplish with a pencil and a paintbrush. I attempted to paint as good as he did and believe Irsquom still trying.Connor continued: ldquoI recall my art teacher at high school, Mr McLaughlin, was a terric influence on me too. It was one of the few classes I actually enjoyed.ldquoAfter A-Levels, I took up art at the University of Ulster and have been painting non-stop since. I won the Chairmanrsquos Award in , and have went on to win the Stephens Award, Anna Cheyne Award and Carnathan Galleries Award.ldquoI work three days a week at the Assumption Grammar as an art technician. I work with the students, helping them explore print making and they seem to love it.Connor also works steadily as a freelance artist, specialising in painting from watercolours to oils, printmaking in the form of woodcuts, linocuts, drawings in charcoal and graphite exhibiting, and in case he might have a spare moment or two, he is a professional picture framer too.Most of Connorrsquos paintings are inspired by themes of portraiture and he has a keen eye for figure and character in familiar settings like a simple family meal. He takes inspiration form the essence of someone which he can capture through some serious study.Taking part in the exhibition, which is now in its th year, is another stepping block to Connor gaining recognition on the international stage where interest has been coming from American art curator, Didi Menendez and the RJD Gallery in New York.Both notable art critics and buyers who he has been in contact with could well result in him exhibiting further afield.Connor has also took part in BBC Radio  programmes talking about his work with broadcasting journalists, Perminder Khatkar and Helen Marks.Last year he featured on BBC rsquos lsquoThe Arts Showrsquo talking about his work with Marie Louise Muir.He says it was a ldquocool feeling to be featured alongside actor Ciaran Hynds who was featured in the same programme.Connor was shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  in association with Artists  Illustrators Magazine, exhibiting in Londonrsquos prestigious Mall Galleries alongside some of Britainrsquos greatest artists.He was also shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  with the same magazine. winning the West Dean College Award exhibiting again in the Mall Galleries in London.This RHA exhibition will catapult Connor further than he can imagine and said hersquod like to concentrate on portraiture and introduce more figures into the paintings on the theme of realism and experiment on learning new things in printmaking with woodcuts and etching.More of Connorrsquos work can be viewed on his website www.connormaguire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bid to boost tourism in Downpatrick area  ","story":"MORE emphasis on tourism promotion across Downpatrick and Lecale has the potential to signicantly enhance the districtrsquos economy, according to a UUP candidate in tomorrowrsquos local council election.Alexander Burgess, who is contesting one of the five seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick DEA, believes more needs to be done to make the most of the arearsquos unique link with St Patrick.Mr Burgess, who was recently joined by his party leader, Robin Swann, on a visit to the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint in Downpatrick, is confident that furthering St Patrickrsquos links with Downpatrick and wider Lecale can help promote new business opportunities, including hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.He is also delighted that planning permission was recently secured for a major new hotel at the site of the former Abbey Lodge development at the Belfast Road on the outskirts of the town.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one economic driver and we are blessed with so many fantastic places to visit in Downpatrick and across the wider district, said Mr Burgess.ldquoMany areas would give all they had to have such an important link with St Patrick. Downpatrick boasts Irelandrsquos only centre dedicated to him but I believe more needs to be done to fully exploit the tourism potential the patron saint offers us.Mr Burgess said additional overnight accommodation in Downpatrick and Lecale was crucial to assisting any new drive to encourage more people to visit and learn about Patrick and the arearsquos rich Patrician heritage.He said having spoken to many people during his election canvass, it is clear there is simply not enough tourism accommodation at present.ldquoIt is rather ironic that while Newry, Mourne and Down Council has quite rightly put tourism at the top of its agenda, there is simply not enough accommodation for people to stay. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, continued Mr Burgess.ldquoThere are already thousands of people visiting the St Patrick Centre every year and how great it would bethere were more places for them to stay to fully exploit what the area has to offer. We already have the Ballydugan Mill hotel on the outskirts of the town and a number of bed and breakfast providers, but we need to capitalise on the lucrative overnight market by providing more bed spaces.Mr Burgess said he hopes that when day-trip tour operators arrange visits to the St Patrick Centre that they will allow additional time for tourists to visit town centre shops, cafes and restaurants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Burgess calls for new centre to be opened  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to open Saintfieldrsquos new community centre immediately.The call has been issued by Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, who is concerned that weeks after work on the eagerly-anticipated Belfast Road centre was completed, the entrance gates remain locked and the ultra-modern facility lies unused.On the eve of tomorrowrsquos local government election, the Recorder understands that while several opening dates were suggested, agreement could not be reached between the ious parties and that the new centre is not expected to open until the end of this month or early June at the earliest.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May  and it is understood that the new centre will not open before then.A local authority spokesman said as the organisation is currently operating under the restrictions of purdah mdash imposed in the lead-up to an election and which restricts councils from making major announcements ndash the opening will not take place until after the local government poll.Cllr Burgess insists he sees no reason why the centre was not opened before now.ldquoIt is my understanding having spoken to senior council officials that all the work has been completed and it is simply a case of opening the centre. I have also been told that the centre could have opened in February. We are now in May and the entrance gates remain locked. This simply isnrsquot on, he declared.ldquoThe delay in opening a centre which the people of Saintfield helped deliver is inexcusable in my book. Over poundm has been invested in the project and while building work has been completed, the cross-community facility remains closed.Cllr Burgess said there was ample time to arrange the official opening of the centre before purdah kicked in and ahead of tomorrowrsquos election.ldquoWhen the council finally gets around to opening a centre which it has allowed to remain closed for several months, it is essential that it invites all those associated with the project, in particular, those involved with the proposal from the outset.ldquoA lot of people have invested considerable time and effort in this project and it is vital their collective efforts are recognised at the official opening.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoThe people of Saintfield and indeed further afield are perplexed as to why the centre has not opened. Perhaps after purdah ends, Newry, Mourne and Down Council will tell the districtrsquos ratepayers why there has been such an extraordinarily y and, in my opinion, totally unnecessary delay.A local authority spokesman confirmed that no date has yet been agreed for the official opening of the new community centre in Saintfield.He added: As the Council is now operating under the restrictions of lsquopurdahrsquo the centre will not open until after the local council elections have taken place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch by pass  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a start on work on Ballynahinchrsquos new poundm by-pass.It comes just days after major gridlock on the main approach roads to the market town over the Easter holiday period in Ballynahinch which is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular.Roads officials say they are keen to get on with the job of building the near two-mile by-pass linking the Belfast and Newcastle roads, with Rowallane Ulster Unionist candidate, Walter Lyons, insisting this must happen now.As part of the multi-million project, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road in Ballynahinch.Mr Lyons said the by-pass must be delivered not only to ease town centre gridlock in Ballynahinch, but to encourage new investment and attract more visitors to the area.ldquoThere is no doubt that traffic congestion in the town centre is an impediment to new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and it must be so frustrating for people from Belfast and other areas who have to make their way through the town during bank and public holidays and over the summer to sit in long tailbacks, he said.Mr Lyons, who was recently joined by UUP leader Robin Swann who was visiting the town, said the campaign for the townrsquos by-pass started  years ago and that the scheme must now be delivered.ldquoMoney has been made available for other major road schemes in Northern Ireland while Ballynahinch continues to wait, he declared. ldquoThe congestion in the town centre was as bad as it has been for many years on Easter Monday and we need to address the issue.ldquoIt is clear that the congestion problem is not only impacting on investment in the town but local tourism. My fear is that people will not want to come to our districtthey are continually caught in traffic snarl-ups.Mr Lyons said log-jammed streets could also impact on the ability of the emergency services to respond to major incidents, should one arise.He added: ldquoCongestion in Ballynahinch impacts on a much wider area yet progress on delivering the much-needed by-pass is painfully slow. It is my understanding that the project cannot move to the procurement and construction stages until the necessary funding is available. This needs to happen.ldquoWe need a financial commitment to build the road to benefit the entire district. The congestion is not solely a Ballynahinch problem but,solved, has the capacity to provide major benefits. We have been told that the scheme is shovel ready so letrsquos get on with the job of building the road.Mr Lyons said thatelected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, delivering the scheme will be one of his key priorities. He said delivering the proposed by-pass must also be a council priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Doubles all round for Wexford men  ","story":"IT was cold and windy at Taylorstown, near Poyntzpass, on Saturday for the annual Newry Point-to-Point races.It proved to a good meeting for Wexford with Barry OrsquoNeil, Jamie Codd and Colin Bowe all recording doubles and also for the Doyle brothers, Donnchadh and Sean.OrsquoNeilrsquos brace saw him record his rd winner of the season, while Codd was chalking up his th success in the All-Ireland ridersrsquo table.Coddrsquos double puts him on the  winner mark in the Northern Ireland Ridersrsquo Regional title race, three ahead of Noel McParlan and Rob James.OrsquoNeil and Bowe got off the mark for the day in the Derrylecka Bedding Centre maiden race for five year-old geldings, the second race of the day.Here, the partnership scored with Cremant, winning in good style from Codd on McGarry, owned by Christine McKnight and trained by her husband, Neil, at Loughbrickland. Third was Snowpiercer, ridden by James OrsquoRourke in place of Rob James.The duo then went on to win the third race, the Seven Stars maiden race for five year-old and upwards mares, with Alice OrsquoByrne coming home seven s clear of Codd on Raddle and Hum. The consistent Moylass and Ben Crawford took third place.Coddrsquos first victory came in the Boydrsquos Stores open race that saw seven go to post.A piece of history was made when his mount Kruzhlinin, owned by Camilla Sharples, who is travelling head girl to Gordon Elliott, became the first horse to win nine races in a season.OrsquoNeil set out to make all on recent Loughbrickland winner Sambremont, but had to be content with a fourth-placed finish. Codd sent his mount clear after the last to beat former champion point-to-pointer Anseanachai Cliste, ridden for the first time by Noel McParlan. John Woodsrsquo Bridgetrsquos Pet, ridden by Harley Dunne, was third.Codd then made all on Amalfi Doug in the Lynda Hughes memorial maiden race for six year-old and upwards geldings. Second past the judge was Bronco Bill, well ridden by Michael Molloy with Pyrios and Barry OrsquoNeil third.The winner is trained in Meath by Jim Dreaper, who was represented at the meeting by his son Tom, who said post-race: ldquoJob done.The best finish of the day came in the Philip McCabe Quantity Surveyor one-winner race with three horses flashing past the post, locked together.Victory went to Getaman, ridden by Derek OrsquoConnor, who has had little success on the local circuit this season.

What did happen, though, was the stuff of dreams.He took a whopping six minutes off his PB and his pacing was textbook, averaging . seconds per mile. Even better, he soaked up the atmosphere and came away saying that it had surpassed his expectations.His club mates, who had tracked him throughout, were as pleased as he was and he was quick to note that the support of fellow members had been a real boost.Having reached halfway in .., Gordy was in no mood to let a possible PB slip through his fingers and though he failed to nail a negative split, it was only by a matter of a few seconds, and perfectly forgivable.His time of .. is something special and deserves the utmost respect. Congratulations, Gordy. And I for one would not begrudge you that beer before you go home as you suggested after the race.Marguerite Robinson was the lucky recipient of the EDAC club ballot back in December and as soon as she heard, she embarked on a schedule to ensure that she made the most of the place.She certainly could not be faulted in her preparation nor in her execution.

Nevertheless, she was as happy as he afterwards. Well done to both of you.Itrsquos not by any means as simple for the enthusiastic spectator.

completing work on an environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street in Downpatrick has been branded a ldquodisgrace by a local politician.Councillor Dermot Curran has this week called for an urgent meeting to be arranged between traders and senior officials from a number of government departments involved in the project to discuss what went wrong and what can be done to ensure the project is completed as soon as possible.Last week the Recorder revealed that Irish Street traders are furious that work on the project is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned.Work to provide new paving, street lighting and street furniture was due to complete at the end of March, but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced, taking the scheme into July.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have also arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base and problems with the sewer network.Cllr Curran wants senior representatives from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities to meet with traders and insists that NI Water must also be represented.ldquoThe public realm scheme has been delayed by over three months, raw sewage has been running down the street and, most shockingly, traders have not been kept abreast of the reasons for the delay, he declared.ldquoThe Irish Street project was due to complete inside three months but it will now be early July and what those responsible for the work do not realise is that businesses are being affected across the town, not just those in Irish Street.Cllr Curran said the delay in completing the scheme is having a major impact on the town centre, revealing that he has heard reports that the number of people using the Irish Street car park has reduced since work on the public realm scheme started.He said with trading conditions dficult enough at the best of times, the last thing business owners need is for the one-way system remaining in place in Irish Street for another two months.ldquoThe delay in completing this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and questions need answered. In addition, traders should be provided with weekly progress briefings as a matter of courtesy.

After spending his first four months in a hospital neo-natal unit and undergoing heart surgery on his first birthday, he is now four. Thankfully, Dabhoacuteg has turned the corner despite overcoming serious medical obstacles in his short le.Dabhoacuteg and his  month-old brother, Conall, mean everything to Cormac and his we Louise, who now live in Belfast.ldquoWhenever you have a sick child and you go through an ordeal like that with your family, it does definitely alter your perception and you come out the other side of it changed, said Cormac.ldquoYou just look at le in a dferent way. You appreciate stuff that you never appreciated because yoursquore not sitting in an intensive care unit in the Royal [Victoria Hospital]. Anything is better than that.The couple only had a few weeks to privately celebrate getting pregnant with their first child when Louise had to be rushed into hospital.They initially were advised that pregnancy was lost as it was so early but were told to come back to hospital in a few weeks time.ldquoIt was the longest two weeks in my le, recalls Cormac. ldquoThe night before we were due to go the hospital I went out for a walk in the Mournes. I was a bit raging at the world and screaming up to the heavens asking to be give a sign that everything was going to be ok.ldquoI was literally stopped dead in my tracks with this little splash of white high in a tree. I climbed up into the tree to see what it was and it was a white feather.ldquoI had always been brought up to believe that white feathers symbolised new le. I couldnrsquot believe that I spotted it at that time and brought it back down. I had a feeling then that everything was ok. The next day we went to hospital and sure enough there was this tiny mustard seed on the scan with the most giant heartbeat you ever saw in your le. It was the beginning of what was to be a most tumultuous journey and the beginning of where we are now, having an amazing four-year-old and a baby.ldquoDabhoacuteg really is a warrior. Hersquos been through more than me and most people ever will in their lives.Long-term fans of The Answer may be surprised at one of their leaders heading to Nashville to write and record the album.But as Cormac tells it, itrsquos just the way it was meant to be.He went to the home of country music in  on a songwriting course to help write songs for other artists but ended up literally pouring his heart and pain out in the songs mdash in time-honoured country music fashion.ldquoItrsquos not a country record but you can tell it is recorded in Nashville, said Cormac.ldquoThere is an awful lot of soul to it and a bit of subtley to it as well as it allowed me to express myself in the way that I needed to at this point in my le. I needed to make a record that reflected that switch in the way I see le.The Nashville approach to writing songs was a more reflective experience for Cormac that what he is used to with bandmates Paul Mahon, Mickey Waters and James Heatley.ldquoIt was just a completely dferent approach to songwriting that I had been used to doing for  years with The Answer, said Cormac. ldquoItrsquos a hard rocking blues band and a lot of our songs are written with the volume pedal turned up rfing away, having a good time and letting songs organically develop.ldquoIn Nashville, you sit in a room with two other people and an accustic guitar and you have a long conversation about your le and what you might want to write about. I found once we were locked into the message we wanted to put across in the song everything  fell into place. We basically wrote songs in the morning and recorded in the afternoon as thatrsquos what the studio expected.ldquoA lot of what Irsquom singing about on this record just would not work on a record from The Answer because it wouldnrsquot be appropriate. Rock and roll is loud and le-affirming. While a lot of these songs are le-affirming, they are in a completely dferent way.Cormac assures the bandrsquos devoted following that they have stockpiled a supply of new songs and will be coming out with a new album.Addressing his own personal hiatus, Cormac added: ldquoIrsquom still the same guy I was in The Answer and will be again when The Answer makes our next record. I just needed to get into the right room with the right writers making the right music.White Feather album will be released on April  before a tour kicks off in the UK on May  for a run of seven support shows followed by six Irish headline dates.

Sands struck with all the stealth and power that her dad Noel displayed for Down hurlers for many years as she beat Katie Smith all ends up with a clinical finish.Meath were now on the ropes and Sands delivered a second knock-out blow a minute later when she again ghosted in to direct a McCartan pass to the net and give down a - to - interval lead.Meath had the wind advantage after the break, but it was Down and the unrelenting McCartan who took centre stage.Two sensational points from the Castlewellan teenager, a daughter of former Down All-Ireland medal winner Greg in , stretched Downrsquos lead to seven points with only five minutes of the second half played.All credit to Meath, they steadfastly refused to throw in the towel and a Foley point left them trailing - to - after  minutes.It wax at this stage that Savage played a real captainrsquos role from her central half back role. She was simply imperious, plucking the sliotar out of the air and then sending it forward for her team-mates to chase.Meath went close to giving Down a fright in the rd minute when an explosive shot from Fagan rattled off the crossbar and was cleared to safety, but other than that, little got past Savage.McCartan and Leonard swapped points as the game drew to a close, but Down had no intention of relinquishing their grip on the game and refused to give Meath any more scores.Down: Niamh Sharkey, Orlaith OrsquoRourke, Hannah Toner, Alice Coulter, Isabella OrsquoHare, Blanaid Savage, Niamh Dempster, Megan OrsquoBoyle, Anna McKee, Cerys Clarke, Sorcha McCartan , Saoirse Sands , Gerra McGrattan, Aoibhinn Brentnall , Beth Fitzpatrick.

Ultimately the Ulster Unionist Party have paid the price for impotency and refusing to align themselves with a universal unity of purpose within unionism. Letter to the editorThe DUP are virtually unchallenged as the sole champions of unionism. That entails a massive responsibility resting on the shoulders of their leadership.In the cockpit of negotiations over Brexit and restoring lasting devolution all unionists have a duty to unite in order to secure the best results in the best interests of the country . In this council election , soft unionists have crossed the road from ‘vote Mike to get Colm’ to the Alliance and the Green parties. There is nothing new in moderates finding temporary political homes. However unionists, and in particular the DUP, should demonstrate their respect for the Alliance success in gaining seats.

Stead behaved very penitent but Turpin behaved with the greatest Assurance and Boldness to the very last. It was very remarkable, that as he mounted the Ladder his right Legg trembled, on which he stampt it down with an Air of Boldness, and with undaunted Courage look’d round about him, then after speaking a few Words to the Topsman, he threw himself off the Ladder, and expired in about five Minutes. Before his Death he declared himself to be the notorious Highwayman Turpin, and confessed a great number of Robberies which he had committed. [The men were hanged at Knavesmire, York’s equivalent ofTyburn in London. Turpin’s death had been reported briefly in the previous News Letter, but as more information arrived by letter, more details were published]Epigram on TURPIN, by a Gentleman of YorkFull oft the South has sneer’d our Northern ClimeAnd Horse-stealing been call’d a County CrimeBut now no longer we will bear such Jokes.This Rogue is theirs, and we the honest Folks.Of Knaves and Fools, we don’t say we have neither,But Knave and Fool are seldom found together.Belfast marathon was too long, organisers admit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Our purer Northern Air’s too sharp by half,A YORKSHIRE TIKE has bit this ESSEX CALF.This dull-bred Rogue has found it to his Cost.

three places to Arlene Fosters right at the DUP manesto launch earlier this monthAlthough the two were never formally linked, it was the church which provided not just many of the early DUP candidates, but also the foot soldiers who enthusiastically campaigned for the upstart party which would smash Northern Ireland’s political establishment.There were always criticisms from some in both church and party who saw the tension between a secular party with ambitions of winning votes and a fundamentalist church with the aim of saving souls.But those largely lay below the surface until Paisley’s decision to enter government with Sinn Fein, something which dismayed many in the church, who had been taught to view Sinn Fein in theological terms as the representatives of evil. The church gave Paisley an ultimatum: Choose to remain as moderator or remain as first minister. He opted for the latter and, after  years, was replaced as moderator.In his blistering valedictory interview with Eamonn Mallie in , Paisley said that his church critics “do not have the ear of God on this matter [power-sharing with Sinn Fein]”, a claim which appeared almost sacrilegious to some within the church. He also said that his family no longer entered his former church – although his son Kyle remains a Free Presbyterian cleric in England.Then in December  the church criticised the party for allowing retrospective pardons of those convicted of homosexual offences to pass through the Assembly. In implicit praise of the DUP’s nemesis, the church said that the proposal “was opposed only by Mr Allister of the TUV while sadly many others remained silent”. The church said it was “deeply grieved and bitterly disappointed” at the failure of MLAs to oppose the pardons.Now the uneasy relationship between a party which sees the strategic value in secularising and a church which believes that God’s law is unchangeable have ed with the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as one of its council candidates. Ms Bennington has said she is standing “based on what I can deliver as a councillor ... not based on my sexual orientation”, and it is clear that the party leadership has endorsed what in any other party would be a fairly unremarkable stance.Ms Bennington was chosen centrally by the party, itself an indication that the party was taking a strategic decision to test the waters with its supporters. But for a party which once campaigned under the banner ‘Save Ulster from sodomy’ for homosexuality to remain a criminal offence, it is nevertheless a striking indication of how the DUP is changing.Traditionalist DUP MLA Jim Wells, who is currently suspended by the party, has been outspoken about what he described as a hint of “a major – and very worrying – change in the policy of the DUP on social issues”.On Saturday, TUV leader Jim Allister said he was struck in canvassing “by the number of lelong DUP voters dismayed by what they see as their party’s softening on the gay marriage issue because of the Bennington nomination”.Mr Wells yesterday said that “many, many DUP members up to the highest level”, including MPs, MLAs and former ministers, had been in contact with him to express concern about the issue because it was “a huge change in the ethos and tradition of the DUP”.Free Presbyterian sadness at the political normalisation of relations that contravene Scripture Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The South Down MLA said that there was concern within the party that it was “a step towards other radical change” and that people who had in some cases been members of the party for  years “simply cannot come to terms with this decision”.At the weekend, DUP veteran John Carson, posted on Facebook about the decision. The Ballymena councillor, who is standing for re-election on Thursday, said that he had been aDUP member for  years but “I say quite openly and with no fear of the consequences ‘NOT IN MY NAME’. I first entered politics because of my admiration for Dr Ian RK Paisley and ... I make no apologies to anyone for saying I am an old Paisleyite.”He went on: “I believe in the coming days not only myself but many of us will have some soul-searching to do and some tough decisions to make”. Invoking images of Old Testament idolatry, Mr Carson asked people to pray for wisdom for “those of us who have not bowed the knee to baal” as they “stand against evil in these days”.On Saturday, the presbytery officers of the Free Presbyterian Church issued a statement which was unusually oblique for a denomination known for its full-frontal assaults on those it regards as acting sinfully. The statement, a clear response to the DUP move, did not name the party but said that it “underlines its opposition to all marital and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of Scripture.”The statement was read out in some Free Presbyterian churches on Sunday, although not in others, in what may be a hint of the church – as well as the party – being split on the issue.Although a tiny denomination, Free Presbyterianism has long exerted an influence which exceeds its size, both through the DUP and its frequent pronouncements to the media about issues of public morals.One church source said that there was a desire among some within the congregation to see DUP party officers who are members of the church disciplined for their role in Ms Bennington’s selection.In response to the church’s statement, the DUP merely said: “Our position on support for traditional marriage is well known and as the party leader indicated last week, it has not changed.”An academic study, published as the book The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest To Power, four years ago found that the Free Presbyterian Church continued to wield huge influence within the party, with % of DUP members being Free Presbyterian. That meant that Free Presbyterians were  times more common in the DUP than in the population.It has been clear for some time that the DUP is no longer “the DUP at prayer”. Butthe DUP continues on its path to expand its voting base, even the continued high levels of cross-membership of church and party may increasingly become a thing of the past.If that accelerates the DUP’s liberalisation it could be signicant for everyone in Northern Ireland.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKeeSpeeder clocked at mph on

It is expected to take around  council seats.Unexpected victories and a surge in votes for the middle ground Alliance party saw its share of votes rise from .% to .%.The Green party and independents also made signicant gains across the  councils.The Green party’s Mal O’Hara was elected to Belfast City Council in what has been a hugely successful election for his party in Northern Ireland’s capital.Holding a rainbow flag, he celebrated with a kiss from his partner and a hug from party leader Clare Bailey.Around  seats have been filled with just under  councillors waiting to be elected.The Ulster Unionist Party suffered some of its biggest causalities with the loss of high-profile Belfast councillor Jeff Dudgeon.In a disastrous election for his party in Belfast, Mr Dudgeon was eliminated on the third stage of the count.The SDLP also lost some of its seats after gaining % of first preference votes - a drop of .%.A swing to the political centre but the DUP and Sinn Fein stay top Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In Omagh, a former MP who resigned after angering relatives of  Protestants shot dead in a sectarian massacre won a council seat.Barry McElduff was forced to resign his Westminster seat last year amid an outcry after he posted a video of himself balancing a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head.It was posted on his Twitter account on the anniversary of the Kingsmill atrocity, which saw  workmen shot dead by republicans in Co Armagh on January  .DUP leader Arlene Foster said she did not believe Mr McElduff has recognised the hurt and pain he caused to victims in Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, the son of murdered Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane was elected to Belfast City Council.John Finucane was elected on the first count of the Castle district electoral area - which encompasses parts of north Belfast - with , votes, just behind the Alliance Party’s Nuala McAllister, who attracted , votes.In further controversy, Mrs Foster said she will consider comments made by former health minister Jim Wells about the DUP’s first openly gay councillor in Northern Ireland.The leader said her party will look at a number of issues including “bad behaviour” by members after the local elections have concluded.It comes after Mr Wells said his former leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, would have been “aghast” at the decision to run gay DUP candidate Alison Bennington.The DUP’s founder once led a campaign to, in his words, “Save Ulster from Sodomy” and prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality.Mrs Foster said Mr Wells should not have made the comments to the media.Independent republican councillor Gary Donnelly topped the poll in the Moor district electoral area of Derry City and Strabane District Council.He is considered one of the public faces of dissident republicanism in Northern Ireland.Mr Donnelly’s election comes weeks after dissident republicans murdered journalist Lyra McKee during disturbances in Londonderry.try catch  TrendingN.I. local elections -

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful. In the law it doesnrsquot state what you have to use to pick up the dog fouling. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In a statement, they said: \"With millions of people signing online petitions there is a clear appetite for using digital technology to engage with politics.\"By fusing online engagement opportunities with MPs of all parties the group intends to become a signicant mass movement with , members and  MPs onboard by the end of .\"More United CEO Bess Mayhew said: ldquoPeople see cross-party working as a proxy for trust in politics.\"Thatrsquos why we are delighted Stephen Doughty MP has chosen to be a part of the More United network.\"Now we need to start tackling the important issues being ignored because of Brexit and give a voice to people who want to move Britain forward. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive. With margins so tight, that tax burden is making le dficult for high street retailers.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Email-640x315.jpg","title":"it firm pinnacle hosting event at kingspan stadium","story":"Posted on Tuesday  April  by Ulster Business A leading IT firm will host an event at the home of Ulster Rugby at an event to help educate and inform businesses.

Corporate lending to Danske Bank customers fell by % during the first quarter of the year as Brexit uncertainty meant customers put off investment, chief executive Kevin Kingston said. Profit before loan impairments was up % to £.m. But corporate lending was down, Mr Kingston said, \"with the heightened uncertainty around Brexit during quarter one persuading some our larger customers to delay planned investments until later in the year\". But overall business banking lending, of which corporate lending is part, had increased by %, mainly to existing customers. The chief executive said many business banking clients had been pursuing growth plans, but that others were extending their borrowing to prepare themselves \"for any economic challenges that could be associated with the Brexit process\".
