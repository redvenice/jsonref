Ahead of a major Guggenheim show, he explains his epiphany It was while visiting a brothel on the outskirts of Reno, Nevada, that Rem Koolhaas had his latest epiphany. The Dutch architect was there to meet Lance Gilman, the cowboy hat-wearing proprietor of the Mustang Ranch bordello who is the unlikely visionary behind some of the planet’s largest yet least known buildings. What Koolhaas saw that day would radically alter his thinking on the future of architecture.A short drive from the heart-shaped swimming pools and red faux crocodile-skin furniture of Gilman’s office in the adult resort, a strange apparition of enormous white rectangles appeared in the desert. “It is a fantastically beautiful landscape,” says Koolhaas, “with rolling hills and wild horses. And in the middle of it all were these colossal structures, placed in a way that didn’t seem to suggest any coherence or sign of human inhabitation.”If you look at the area on Google Earth, these blocks appear like large chalky fields, or the salt evaporation pools of a lithium mine. But they are mines of a different kind: vast industrial sheds housing the technology behind the blockchain, the cloud, and the future of electric vehicles.This is the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), the largest industrial park in the world, a 107,000-acre swath of the Nevada desert that has become the backroom for Silicon Valley’s big tech companies, lured here by the favourable tax regime and instant building permits. Gilman bought the land for $20m in 1998 from Gulf Oil, which had planned to fill it with big game and turn it into a luxury hunting reserve. Gilman quickly had it zoned for industrial use, and the big boxes have sprung up like rectangular fungi after rain. It is now home to gargantuan hangars for Google and Apple, along with distribution warehouses for businesses such as Walmart and Amazon, and the new Tesla battery “Gigafactory” – set to be, at 1m sq metres, the world’s biggest building when finally complete.It might be fitting that a brothel baron now presides over a landscape of “fulfilment centres” of another kind, but what interested Koolhaas wasn’t the developer, nor the chance of another commission. It was that the buildings were thrillingly different from anything he had encountered before.“There has been no architecture of a similar vigour in the last 100 years,” he writes in an ode to the sheds. “It is based strictly on codes, algorithms, technologies, engineering and performance, not intention. Its boredom is hypnotic, its banality breathtaking.” For Koolhaas, these buildings embody a new kind of sublime.A pair of 12ft-high photographs of the data centres now hang on the top floor of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, occupying the final level of a sprawling exhibition, momentously titled Countryside, The Future, set to open next week. Five years in the making, and drawing on a decade of research undertaken by his team at AMO (the “thinktank” of Koolhaas’s  practice, the Office for politan Architecture, or OMA) and armies of volunteer students, the scope of the show is nothing if not ambitious.At the age of 75, Koolhaas is turning his back on the very thing that made his career. For the last 40 years he has been the seer of cities, provocative poet of the urban condition, producing polemical texts on the unintended consequences of modernity. He made his name with the sizzling “retroactive manifesto” for Manhattan, Delirious New York, in 1978. Since then he has theorised on everything from the explosion of Chinese megacities to the lure of shopping malls, and the proliferation of bland “junkspace” in airports and business parks. His tone is at once celebratory and contemptuous, as if simultaneously intoxicated and repelled by the phenomena he describes. The buildings produced by OMA have occupied a similar realm, treading a fine line between the bold and banal. They often reflect the unvarnished, brute reality of the city and, more recently in the case of his blocky, mixed-use building the Timmerhuis in Rotterdam, the naked financial interests that shaped them.But now the rest of the world has caught up and the urban obsession has taken over, the self-styled contrarian has had to move on. “I am interested in the countryside now for the same reason that I was paying attention to New York in the 70s,” Koolhaas says. “Because no one else was looking.”His interest in rural transformation was first piqued by changes that he noticed in a Swiss village in the Engadin valley, where he had holidayed for years. The area’s population was decreasing, yet the village was expanding, with an ever-increasing number of holiday homes and a new demographic: urbanites seeking wellness, accompanied by a transitory community of south Asian housemaids. These discoveries prompted Koolhaas to survey a chunk of the Dutch countryside, where he found farmers ersifying alongside an influx of wealthy city-dwellers wanting to sample life in the country, “attracted by the aura of authenticity”.“We started to find deeply absurd conditions,” he says. The more he looked, the more he started to see the global countryside as an enormous canvas on which anything too large, complex or unsafe to blend with urban life takes place. “A world formerly dictated by the seasons and the organisation of agriculture,” he writes, “is now a toxic mix of genetic experiment, science, industrial nostalgia, seasonal immigration, territorial buying sprees, massive subsidies, incidental inhabitation, tax incentives, investment, political turmoil – in other words more volatile than the most accelerated city.” While we were all concentrating on cities, he argues, the next revolution was forging ahead in the hinterland, undisturbed.There is a naivety to how Koolhaas recounts some of these revelations, which suggests a sheltered urbanite whose musings on rural life are as ill-fitting as muddy wellies in his Prada wardrobe. Yet much of the strength of his work has come from approaching topics as an innocent outsider. One mentor from his early life as a journalist, before he moved into architecture, told him to treat every situation as if he was a Martian new to Earth. It can be a compelling style of writing, but will this detached observer’s deadpan study of disparate rural phenomena translate into a meaningful exhibition?The sense that this is no ordinary Guggenheim show will begin before you enter the building. Visitors will be greeted by a gigantic hi-tech tractor, capable of being controlled from an iPad, parked on the pavement next to a large module growing tomatoes under pink light: objects from the digitised frontline of agriculture brought back to the city.In a manner reminiscent of the architect Philip Johnson’s seminal Machine Art show in 1934 at New York’s Museum of Modern Art (which placed utilitarian, industrially manufactured objects in a museum setting for the first time) visitors will encounter a satellite dangling in the atrium, along with a big bale of hay and an underwater drone designed to patrol coral reefs. From here, the rotunda spiral will extend upwards in a continuous stream of consciousness, with sections on leisure, politics, preservation, agricultural automation and numerous other facets of rural existence that have preoccupied the busy Dutchman and his extensive cast of collaborators.“It is a total panoply of voices and themes, cutting across space and time in a really unconventional way,” says Guggenheim curator Troy Conrad Therrien. “It abandons the usual museological preciousness of classification and creates juxtapositions intended to make people think.”The list of themes reads like the contents page of National Geographic crossed with Wired. It includes the countryside as a cradle of culture in ancient China and Rome how dictators from Stalin to Mao have left their mark on the land the ways that Chinese investment is transforming chunks of Africa how refugees have been housed in abandoned towns in eastern Germany how gorillas are interacting with tourists in the Congo the impact of thawing permafrost in Siberia technological change in American midwest farms. The list goes on. They sound like fascinating, urgent stories, but it is hard to see how they might form a coherent narrative. And what has it all got to do with architecture?“It has nothing to do with architecture,” Koolhaas admits. “It is more anthropological and sociological. I find it exciting that an art institution would dedicate so much space to something that is not art or architecture.” Therrien describes it as a “pointillist portrait of a mutating territory”, a show about curiosity and questioning rather than providing answers. “Will it feel overwhelming to the visitor? Yes.” Might it feel colonialist and out of touch? Maybe. “We haven’t tried to put a wokeness veneer over the show,” he says. “In the age of outrage, there are some things that people might take out of context and create a hurricane around, but they are what they are.”There is a tendency for “research-led” architectural exhibitions to end up feeling like a book stuck to the wall, and there is a danger the Guggenheim exhibition could fall into that trap. Therrien says that text will be a big part of the show, along with huge printed curtains and long ribbons of wallpaper that will wrap around many of the walls, with video screens showing documentary footage. There will also be a handful of roving robots, of the kind used in fulfilment centres, adorned with styrofoam cutouts intended to “constantly throw the curatorial ball up in the air”.Some who were involved in the project fear Koolhaas might have finally bitten off more than he can chew. “It’s problematic to call it ‘research’,” says Charlotte Leib, a doctoral student at Yale, who was part of the exhibition’s team when she was studying at Harvard. “There are thousands of experts in these fields, and some of them were contacted, but it was a process of sculpting their findings towards the worldview of Rem.” Another research assistant is frank: “It’s symptomatic of architectural hubris that they take snapshots of a topic like this and present it to the world as ‘new’.”So what does Koolhaas want visitors to take away from his grand rural ramble? “I’ve always tried to put relevant issues on the architecture agenda,” he says. “I am not thinking there should be more planning of the countryside, or that it is the next big place for architects to intervene.” His attraction to the megastructures of the industrialised hinterland is precisely because they have nothing to do with architects. They are ultra-utilitarian sheds, orced from architectural ambition.“There is a danger of Midas in reverse, in terms of the consequences of architectural attention suddenly shifting to phenomena that were being developed innocently on their own,” he says. “But I think it’s more likely that architecture will change as a result of what’s happening outside cities, rather than architects spoiling this new field.”Koolhaas says his own practice has already been influenced by what he calls the “post-human” architecture of the colossal sheds at TRIC and elsewhere, which he sees as embodying a kind of unparalleled purity. “We are programmed to think that any ‘next’ architecture can only be the outcome of a struggle,” he writes, in an exhibition catalogue essay. “Modernism was born in a relentless campaign of stripping: of ornament, bourgeois values, frivolity. Because it takes place in the countryside, this is a stealth revolution … The buildings here are not for humans but for things and machines. Thousands of years of architectural and cultural history are ditched.”He describes OMA’s new performing arts centre in Taipei, still under construction, as a result of this logic – “halfway between a building for humans and machinery”. It incorporates a huge amount of back-of-house space for scenery and mechanisms to transform the auditoria in multiple configurations. The Factory, a new £130m venue being designed for Manchester, looks distinctly shed-like, and one wonders if OMA might be taking the “post-human” idea a bit too literally, judging by the blank street frontage of its recent building for Brighton College.Koolhaas’s exit from the city comes at a time when he seems increasingly detached from the built output of his practice. He keeps his own separate office in Amsterdam, away from the 300-strong team in Rotterdam, where he can concentrate away from the hubbub. There has been a restructuring of the partnership, so he is no longer the dominant overseeing principal, and OMA’s buildings are now credited to the inidual partners. He rarely attends the openings. Is this epic exhibition his swan song before quitting architecture?“Am I going to retire?” he barks, incredulously, before changing the subject to a new kind of tractor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3fa1cd964ee8dd81e4e3bd9bcb165860561635/100_251_3369_2021/master/3369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=209f814fc942082eff188f9a06635d38","title":"government windrush tough migration","story":"Even as the Windrush scandal was being exposed, there were signs that the bad headlines would change neither this government’s treatment of migrants nor the debate about immigration. Certainly not the kind of change that would match the scale of the damage done. Almost without skipping a beat, politicians talked about the necessity of deporting “illegal immigrants”. Before long, they were discussing “highly skilled” and “high value” migrants. People cannot be illegal, people are not economic commodities – they are human beings living in a world structured by class, gender and race.Now we have moved on to “foreign national offenders”. Refusing to release or even pretend to pay the slightest attention to the Windrush Lessons Learned review, the government has deported 17 people to Jamaica – and in doing so it has communicated that it will continue to be “tough” on immigration. It’s necessary, it says, to deport black people from this country – regardless of whether the UK was the only home they’d ever really known or if they’d served their sentences in the criminal justice system. Once again black people are being treated as second-class citizens.We hear about black and brown people being deported but almost never white Americans or Australians – do they not breach their visa requirements or commit crimes? T his language of “criminality” has become a blanket term that the government uses to justify its actions. The same politicians who see migrants as a threat to “British values” such as the “rule of law” tried to deport people who didn’t get proper access to legal advice, and then complained when the courts tried to prevent it. The irony is bitter indeed.We don’t yet know exactly who the 17 people were aboard the flight, but the impact will likely be devastating to them, tearing them away from the lives they’ve created, their family and friends, and forcing them to a country they haven’t chosen to go to. This is the essence of deportation. The determination with which the government has pursued this illustrates how wedded they are to anti-immigration politics and to flaunting that politics whenever it can. The flight has gone ahead, without a large chunk of its intended passengers on board. It is all to tell us: the courts can’t stop us we won’t release or reflect on the Lessons Learned Review – no matter what, we’re going to be “tough” on migrants.Such displays of “toughness” are littered through recent UK history. The government’s social media campaign that boasted about immigration raids in 2013, the infamous “Go home” vans, New Labour’s decision to deport at least 20 people to Afghanistan in 2003. All one needs to consider is the fact that the government proudly called its package of policies the “hostile environment” before the recent, largely cosmetic, rebrand.For people on the receiving end of that toughness, what they experience is cruelty. This isn’t peripheral to how the UK immigration system functions, it is central to it. It is in detention centres, rat-infested asylum accommodation run by private contractors, dispersal schemes, immigration fees. But it also s this country’s history, from the deeply antisemitic Aliens Act 1905 to the unequivocally racist Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968. “This is not a glitch in the system”, wrote Gary Younge about the Windrush scandal. “It is the system.”To reckon with all of this, we have to confront and ultimately dismantle the core anti-immigration arguments that have been circulating for decades. It is not enough to snip around the edges of this subject: “migrants” are people and movement is not inherently threatening. Most of us are familiar with them: immigration is bad for the economy, driving down wages and draining public services. The “migrant” is someone who is at once taking that nursing post that supposedly could have been filled by a “British worker”, and also pushing the NHS to breaking point. Politicians get fixated on numbers – how many people are coming into the country, how many are leaving – until numbers tell them something that isn’t helpful for their anti-immigration argument. The Windrush review hasn’t been released in much the same way as nine reports showing immigration didn’t have any negative impact on wages were suppressed by Theresa May’s Home Office, according to the former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable.The other anti-immigration argument that snakes perniciously around the debate, strangling attempts to locate where race is and how race functions, is: “It’s not racist to be concerned about immigration.” Too many immigrants of a certain kind, we are told, are “culturally” incompatible with Britishness or Englishness – just as people of colour who were born in the UK are questioned about whether they’re truly British.But there is no static British or English culture. “What does anybody in the world know about an English person except that they can’t get through the day without a cup of tea?” said the late cultural theorist Stuart Hall. “Where does it come from? Ceylon – Sri Lanka, India. That is the outside history that is inside the history of the English. There is no English history without that other history.” Yet precisely because this history is poorly known, race continues to be central to the debate in complicated and subtle ways. It shapes who is seen as a “migrant” and who isn’t who is a threat and who isn’t.None of this means change isn’t possible – deportation laws did not always look like this. The government wants people to feel like resistance will fail that it’s pointless to even try. But the opposition to this deportation can be the start of something bigger: a refusal to accept anti-immigration politics in all of its forms.• Maya Goodfellow is the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2db017388b5044ef6e7548ed0dc0e86941c420be/0_79_3561_2138/master/3561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8f60be07779d341e4daa4e315e93596","title":"uk brexit britain hs2 scottish bridge","story":"Build bridges, not walls. It’s an evergreen lesson from history, although it would help if Boris Johnson didn’t keep taking it literally.The prime minister’s fantasy of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, supposedly to help both feel more connected to the union, was solemnly trotted out once again this week as if it wasn’t preposterous. What’s pulling the United Kingdom apart is not geography but the politics of a Brexit conducted on England’s terms, and that’s not going to be resolved by plonking some implausible white elephant in the sea.That’s not the only bridge being unveiled this week, however. The HS2 fast rail network, finally set to get the green light today more than a decade after work first began, also functions more like a bridge than a wall, because it’s meant to bring closer parts of the country that have sometimes felt estranged. Unlike the Scottish bridge, it’s both absolutely feasible and so far advanced already that retreating could have been harder than going ahead, no matter how many billions over budget it’s likely to run.There are solid reasons to proceed with HS2 that go beyond the merely symbolic. But big infrastructure projects are always at heart about more than tarmac and concrete, which is partly why delivering them invariably becomes tortured. From Japan’s bullet trains to Donald Trump’s wall to Dubai’s skyscrapers, they’re about how a nation sees itself and what values it wishes to project living monuments to progress, technological innovation, success (or in the case of Trump’s wall, none of the above). It shouldn’t remotely matter which city boasts the world’s tallest building, yet for some inexplicable reason it’s become a symbol of national virility.And the symbolism of HS2 clearly matters to a prime minister promising to “level up” across the country and return prosperity to the north. True, there’s no evidence that what voters in the Labour seats that turned blue last December really wanted was faster trains to London. But some local improvements do depend on it going ahead, and ministers have hastily assembled a package to boost local bus and train routes alongside a revised HS2 plan expected to include some potentially unpopular cutbacks and compromises north of Birmingham.Ironically, when HS2 was first conceived, under a Labour government, it was seen as a means not just of connecting up Britain but also of consolidating its place in Europe. Years ago, I remember the then transport secretary Andrew Adonis (who originally championed it) showing me a map of European rail routes on his office wall. Once the Channel tunnel connected British railways to their mainland European counterparts, we looked embarrassingly like poor relations. You could whizz through whole countries quicker than getting from one English city to another.Back then HS2 was going to bring us closer to Europe, but as the years ticked by, its political meaning changed. David Cameron’s government rejected the idea of linking it up with Eurostar so that passengers could get direct from the big northern cities to Europe, concluding that was too expensive. But the project still had crucial political cover as part of George Osborne’s so-called “northern powerhouse” plan for big northern cities. After Brexit, its meaning shifted again, becoming attached to the idea of delivering for voters in the smaller struggling northern towns left out in the cold as Manchester or Birmingham grew, even though it’s far less obvious how many will benefit from trains that don’t stop where they live. But while this emotional case for building bridges with the north clearly feeds into the more sober economic case for HS2, there’s a risk of wildly exaggerating what it can deliver.Of course transport links matter. But you can’t build your way out of the deep-rooted problems countries all over Europe are experiencing with post-industrial towns, which have more to do with jobs, skills, population shifts and economic trends (exacerbated in Britain by 10 years of austerity and about to be multiplied all over again by the consequences of Brexit) than with trains. You can’t build your way out of the nationalist feeling mounting in Scotland or Northern Ireland, either, with a bridge that’s almost certainly never going to happen.What actually builds bridges between cities and countries is the sense that movement between them – whether of goods or people, money or ideas – isn’t a one-way street and that both sides of the bridge are equally valued. If you want to make the four countries of the union feel part of one nation, don’t treat them as petty obstacles to England’s political will being done. And if you want to make the north feel closer to London, that’s about an awful lot more than journey times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b987329f5bd17757efcca5fae0e061ec7ee1113a/625_53_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a52f7cbb04b8f9894eb75e1c8686f3d4","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of infinite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘infinite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘infinite’.Share your photos of what infinite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 February at 10am.

There is almost nothing to the film, Exodus. McQueen had been hanging around Brick Lane marketin London, looking for something to film. The men weave through the Sunday crowds, sometimes disappearing except for their pork pie hats and the potted plants. Shot in 1992, and just over a minute long, Exodus is a kind of talisman for McQueen’s earlier work. Although he didn’t use the footage for five years, Exodus is also an early indication of his ability to seize the moment, to find richness in a detail or a circumstance.Tate Modern’s exhibition of 14 works jumps to 1999, missing those that led to his winning the Turner prize that year, and ends with Weight, from 2016, a prisoner’s bed-frame draped with a gold-plated mosquito net, first shown in an Artangel exhibition in the cells of Reading Gaol. Much from the current century, including his feature films and the work McQueen has been making about Grenfell Tower, is also absent. This may disappoint viewers expecting a full mid-career survey, akin to the Art Institute of ChicagoSchaulager Basel show in 2013. Such a show would need triple the space and, however one might quibble, as an ensemble the current show has density, weight and drama in its very different kinds of confrontations.You are there with Tricky, smoking skunk in the sound booth, as he lays down the vocal track to the song Girls, thrashing around and getting into a kind of trance, pushing himself and twisting the lyrics. The graininess of Sean Bobbit’s Super 8 cinematography in Western Deep makes the 2002 film, as McQueen has said, “stick to the skin”. This intimacy and physical, as well as psychological, sense of proximity and engagement – even engulfment, let alone the astonishment and horror Western Deep provokes, however many times one has seen it – is amped up by those parts of the film when everything collapses into darkness and grain, blur and amorphousness.Illuminer depicts McQueen himself on a Paris hotel bed in the semi-dark, lit by the TV and its footage of American Seals and the war in Iraq. Made in 2001, it is almost the last time the artist appeared in one of his own films and is, like Exodus, another work in which the artist exploited circumstance and the specific conditions of time and place. McQueen is alert to the here and now. This is just as evident in his cinema film work as it is in his gallery films and installations.Throughout the exhibition, we are confronted again and again by black bodies, black subjects, black experience, whether it is the anonymous miners in Western Deep or Tricky the artist’s cousin Marcus, who accidentally shot his brother or Ashes, a young Grenadian who McQueen filmed in 2002, and who was later killed by drug dealers. Then there are the Grenadians who appear in Caribs’ Leap, McQueen himself, his black fingers poking and caressing the folds round Charlotte Rampling’s eye in Charlotte, and rubbing and tweaking his own nipple in Cold Breath.Storytelling, even when what we are presented with is a situation, is a viewpoint. In 7th Nov, the camera’s view of the top of Marcus’s head is as though we are looking at a body on a slab. The views of the cemetery and the workman building Ashes’ tombstone over his pauper’s grave is allied to physicality, position and scale in the artist’s projections. The small screens and lumbering, body-sized projectors for Charlotte and Cold Breath and the large screen on the outside wall of Tate Modern, facing across the river, on which footage of everyday life in Grenada (one half of Caribs’ Leap) is shown, keep us aware that looking at films is a physical as much as a psychological act.The camera circling the Statue of Liberty in a helicopter, showing the bird shit and the rot in the bronze, the sound of helicopter blades thwapping, and the descent 3.5 kilometres underground in Western Deep, one of the world’s deepest gold mines, are felt in the body as well as the head.In a big, otherwise empty room, the redacted FBI files on actor, singer and activist Paul Robeson are projected, unfolding in decades worth of paper and effort that the US spent tracking him. The hour upon hour of readings from the FBI transcripts that echo through the space present a cumulative portrait, both of Robeson himself – every gig, every meeting – and of the state and its paranoid intrusions.Almost every work here begs stories and interpretations. Even with so much missing, there’s complexity enough here, in its shuttles between the image and the backstory, proximity and distance, physical presence and psychological impact and affect. It gets under the skin.• Steve McQueen is at Tate Modern, London, 13 February to 11 May.

It zipped along with relative briskness, it had plenty of memorable moments and – in Parasite – had a record-breaking, genuinely uplifting story.But that doesn’t matter, because nobody watched. The 2020 Oscars will go down as the least-watched ceremony ever, with ABC’s broadcast gaining just 23.6 million viewers in the US, down 6 million from last year. And this isn’t a blip. In 2015, the Oscars were watched by 37 million people. In 2010 they were watched by 41 million. A decade from now, hardly anyone will watch the Oscars at all. Clearly, something needs to be done. But what?Thanks for asking. Allow me to present a clear four-point strategy to making the Oscars great again.This year’s ceremony, though leaner than previous editions, was still punishingly long thanks to some truly baffling choices by producers. Winners were announced by presenters who, since there was no host, were introduced by other people.The best animated feature segment went as follows: Beanie Feldstein walked on stage, introduced herself, then introduced Mindy Kaling, who introduced herself, then read the nominees, then announced the winner, presented the trophy and stepped back while the winners introduced themselves. And that was before a pre-presenter decided to rap a recap of the entire Oscars ceremony up until that point. Also, Eminem’s (unnecessary) performance of a 17-year-old song was preceded by a long (and unnecessary) montage of films with songs in them, which was preceded by Lin-Manuel Miranda (unnecessarily) explaining that some films have songs in them. Then there were the long montages of all the best picture nominees.Get rid of the montages, the Eminem song and the pre-presenters and you’d chop half an hour off the ceremony. More people would watch the show if it wasn’t so exhaustingly long.It was great that Parasite swept the board and made history. It was the best film nominated, and its win means that millions of people might be turned on to non-English-language films. However, the Oscars always get a ratings boost when a box-office hit is in the running. When the third Lord of the Rings film won 11 Oscars in 2004, for instance, it was the most-watched ceremony in half a decade.But the Academy was laughed out of town when it planned a best popular-film category. Besides, the Top 10 films from last year included three Marvel films, two Disney cartoons, two Disney remakes, a DC film, a Star Wars film and a sequel to a Jumanji reboot. None of them are the best films of the year.I suspect the solution might be Netflix. Perhaps if more nominated films appeared on Netflix, people will feel invested in their Oscar chances again. Far more people saw, say, Marriage Story than they would have if it had been traditionally released only in cinemas. But it was available on Netflix, and for a few weeks it was all anyone could talk about. This is the biggest issue. The Oscars are the culmination of awards season. There are simply too many awards ceremonies, all giving gongs to the same people. On Sunday, Brad Pitt, Laura Dern, Joaquin Phoenix and Renée Zellweger won in categories that they’d previously won at the Baftas, the Golden Globes and the SAG awards. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around most of the winners were locked in. Asking people to sit through hours of suspense-less television is a lot. The Oscars can’t destroy the other awards shows, so perhaps the solution is to move it earlier. Let’s have it in the middle of December, before the Golden Globes.Move with the times. Stream the Oscars online, and then let fanatics hack up the footage into YouTube clips – that’s how most people seem to prefer to consume it. Then, you can watch the ceremony in bite-sized chunks after a decent night’s sleep. And then everyone else has a chance to watch something that has higher ratings than the Oscars. The Masked Singer, for instance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c25c7dc9c3f157695c7e08b1a7897f7273145ff/280_186_3547_2129/master/3547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24361014a5fea6a14ba3f2ed8d782d72","title":"oscars 2020 in pictures gallery","story":"From bashful Brad Pitt to James Corden and Rebel Wilson as cats, a selection of the best pictures from the 92nd Academy Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65797dc2587c582ef4fc67ab964472404f6ade7a/0_1347_5046_3026/master/5046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c8f23c44bbff67124f2d3c00b31a16f","title":"nigel slater midweek meal seafood salad langoustine potato","story":"This seafood salad is an indulgent but incredibly simple supperScrub 350g of small potatoes then cook them, in their skins, in deep, lightly salted boiling water for about 15 minutes until tender.

Email feast@thePlease explain tofu. It featured in three recipes in a recent edition of Feast, but I don’t know anything about it, or why I should cook with it. Can you help?Shelley, HertfordshireFuchsia Dunlop, one of the world’s great cheerleaders for Chinese cookery, often finds herself shaking her head at western preconceptions about tofu. “We tend to regard it as an ingredient that’s used almost exclusively by vegetarians,” she says, “but in China, and elsewhere in Asia, tofu is eaten by just about everybody.” That shouldn’t be at all surprising, considering this simple soya bean product is versatile, nutritious and a hugely rich source of protein. It’s very on-message with the west’s current dietary obsessions, too, so if anything, it’s odd that more of us don’t tuck into the stuff more regularly: “It’s a fantastic option for those trying to reduce the amount of animal protein they eat,” Dunlop adds, “be that for environmental, ethical or health reasons.”Put (very) simply, tofu is made from dried soya beans that are soaked in water, milled into soya milk, then strained, heated and coagulated, usually with mineral salts or gypsum (AKA fertiliser – yum!). The resulting curds are wrapped in muslin and pressed, leaving a block that can be cut into cubes, slices or strips. No wonder the British-Thai cook John Chantarasak compares the process to traditional cheese-making. “And, like cheese, tofu varies hugely in texture, from silken to extra-firm,” he says, “and the kind you use depends entirely on the desired end result in any given dish.”He’s not kidding about the variety out there, either. Plain white tofu, which comes in firmish slabs, is the most familiar over here – Dunlop describes it as “delicate and a bit like ricotta”. But there’s also “soft and custardy” silken (or flower) tofu smoked tofu fermented tofu, which usually comes in well-flavoured, often chilli-spiked oil and which Dunlop calls “the Chinese equivalent of ripe blue cheese” … I could go on, but you probably get the picture by now.According to Chantarasak, who hung up his apron at London’s Som Saa last year to set up his own venture, AngloThai, the Thais adopted tofu, or toa-hu as they call it, from China as long ago as the 13th century. It’s now so ingrained in the cooking culture that, traditionally, it’s a key ingredient in one of the country’s most famous dishes, pad thai, though it features only very rarely in versions made here it’s also a regular in mee krob, the popular crispy noodle street food. “Firm tofu is very forgiving,” Chantarasak says. “Cut it into cubes and stir-fry, then serve tossed with seasonal greens, garlic, oyster sauce and soy, or add it to curries and braises.”Silken tofu, as the name suggests, is much more fragile, so that’s best simply steamed: “Thinly sliced spring onion, ginger and a light dressing of soy, sugar and sesame oil are all you need to turn that into a great meal with a bowl of rice,” Chantarasak says.Let’s leave the last word to Dunlop, whose 2003 masterpiece, Sichuan Cookery, was reworked and republished as The Food of Sichuan late last year: “Tofu is not at all deserving of its western reputation as just a poor substitute for meat,” she says. “As entry points, try mapo tofu or sour-and-hot silken tofu, which are both deceptively easy.” They’re ridiculously quick, too – 10 minutes max – so there should be no holding Shelley back now.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Out of the blue, the shock news that a famous German football manager named Jürgen had suddenly resigned was announced, prompting the red half of Merseyside to go into total meltdown.With calm duly restored and a collective sigh of relief blowing through Britain like Storm Ciara, it emerged that, contrary to the worst fears of Liverpool fans, the now ex-gaffer boasting the initials “JK” on his club gilet is in fact Jürgen Klinsmann, who has stepped down as boss of Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin after just 10 weeks at the helm. Having taken over in late November, steered the club out of the relegation zone and spent around £70m on a January transfer trolley dash, the World Cup winner seemed to be on top of his brief but cited a lack of solidarity and trust from suits unspecified as the reason for his decision to quit.“We were on a good path and despite difficult games had moved six points away from the relegation spots,” he explained on social media disgrace FaceSpace. “I am totally convinced that Hertha will stay up. But for that task to be completed, as head coach I need the trust of all those involved. In the fight against relegation unity, solidarity and concentration are the key elements. If they are not guaranteed then I cannot deliver on my full potential as a coach and cannot live up to my responsibilities.”Having swallow-ed into Berlin’s Olympiastadion promising to keep Hertha up and transform them into title contenders with the financial backing of major investor Lars Windhorst, Klinsmann will remain at the club as part of the “supervisory board” upon which he sat before taking over from Ante Covic. “We were surprised about this development,” parped Hertha in a club statement. “Especially after the trusting cooperation regarding personnel decisions during the intensive winter transfer window, there was no sign of this. We will inform you about further developments in due course.”While the club come to terms with this shock news, Klinsmann’s assistant, Alexander Nouri, has been put in charge, while his former boss sets about the process of calming things down by helping to identify and appoint his own replacement.Dele Alli, Duncan Ferguson and Sean Dyche feature in David Squires’s king cartoon on the Premier League’s winter break.

But Macquarie Group Limited is a growing influence on English football, underlined on one day in January by Leicester and Wolves extending sizeable loans with the Australian investment bank that are mortgaged against future TV earnings.Now with a portfolio that also includes Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United, Southampton, Swansea City, Watford, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers, a company estimated to manage almost £288bn worth of assets has emerged as the second-biggest lender behind Barclays Bank in an industry where owners continue to chase the dream. Since 2013 and encouraged by increased transparency in the game following the introduction of Uefa’s financial fair play regulations, Macquarie estimates that it has completed more than $1.5bn in loans across Europe’s major leagues, specialising in “transfer financing” and “media and sponsorship rights monetisation”.Any club that uses such a facility must register a charge – security against the loan – with Companies House. The latest arrangement with Wolves, registered on 13 January, extends their £50m lending facility until March 2021. That means part of the credits of future TV income – worth £130m a season under the latest deal – have been transferred to Macquarie in exchange for their capital, although it is not known how much interest Wolves will pay to receive the money in advance.The latest charge registered by Leicester was also added on 13 January. But rather than being evidence of more borrowing, this was because the arrangement has to be ratified every six months by the Premier League, which distributes TV rights from its central fund.“I understand that a lot of banks are providing similar services but, because they are not formally registering a charge, we don’t see the documentation because nothing is going through Companies House. It’s a risk in the same way that if you take out a mortgage and it helps from a cash flow point of view.”Leicester’s relationship with Macquarie began in October 2018, three months after Riyad Mahrez joined Manchester City for £60m. As is common in most modern transfers, Pep ’s side were due to pay in instalments, with the final £36m due in two tranches by the end of July 2020. Enter Macquarie. In exchange for the £36m, Leicester agreed a secured borrowing facility that means the transfer fee will be paid to Macquarie instead.Leicester’s latest loan does not specify how much they can borrow from Macquarie, although it is the sixth time they have entered an arrangement with the lender. The second – made in December 2018 – has been satisfied but was reported at the time to be larger than the first arrangement over Mahrez and had been earmarked to help fund a new training ground and expand the King Power Stadium. Two more are outstanding, although Maguire does not believe there is any evidence of financial difficulties at a club on course to qualify for the Champions League.“What will often happen is that you might have separate charge arrangements over separate assets belonging to the club,” he says. “It could be something as simple as that I don’t think there is anything Machiavellian in it.”Macquarie says it is selective about who it does business with. It has been marketing its services directly to English clubs and many have jumped at the opportunity to improve their cash flow. Southampton, who previously borrowed money from the mysterious Vibrac Corporation that came under scrutiny from MPs in 2016, have a long-established relationship, having first taken out a loan in November 2016 secured against future TV rights. They have since returned annually and filed a new charge in the summer.Meanwhile, Macquarie purchased half of the credits owed to Crystal Palace from the £45m transfer of Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United last summer. Courtesy of the bank, Bournemouth received the £12m then owed by Aston Villa for the England defender Tyrone Mings 12 months earlier than scheduled. Even Craig Dawson’s £5.5m move to Watford in the summer led West Brom to take out a £2,395,300 loan, corresponding to the amount of the fee they were due to be paid in June 2021.Swansea’s first loan with Macquarie after they sold the Spanish midfielder Roque Mesa in June 2018 was satisfiedlast week, although the Championship club have two outstanding arrangements made almost 18 months ago. High-interest repayments from what Maguire describes as “boutique lenders” have become a feature of the multibillion-pound industry that is modern football but he does not think it necessarily spells trouble.“Any form of borrowing comes with an element of risk,” he says. “But fans might also take the view that if the club borrows and invests that on the pitch with players then that is likely to reduce the risk of relegation, therefore assuring the club of another year’s TV money. It’s a double-edge sword. In an ideal world I think most fans would prefer that the club owner takes on the form of a benevolent dictator and gifts the club the money through an interest-free loan, like Farhad Moshiri has done at Everton. But they are always much harder to find.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ad9096a35943ab0aa454c6641b2bd5b21b249da/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd91fe22df2abff0baf088f4208e0aea","title":"what is judicial review and why doesnt the government like it","story":"Legal challenges to ministerial decisions have recently proved difficult for the ConservativesDowning Street’s frustration over what it believes is excessive use of the judicial review process to overturn ministerial decisions – this week preventing deportations – has focused political attention on the complex courtroom process.It is a means of questioning the lawfulness of decisions made by public bodies, such as local councils, government departments, police forces or health authorities. Cases usually start in the administrative ision of the high court and involve a claimant alleging that an official or minister made a mistake in law.The first stage of an application depends upon a judge deciding there is a legitimate point of law to examine and granting permission for the hearing to go ahead. Often judges hear the permission stage and the substantive arguments at the same time in what is known as a “rolled-up” hearing. The challenged public body responds to the claim, and other parties with an interest in the issue can intervene in cases.The government was defeated in two Brexit judicial reviews in the supreme court – one on article 50 and the other on the prorogation of parliament – although both resulted in parliament’s powers being re-asserted. These outcomes have re-sharpened the suspicion of judicial review claims.Having complained for so long about European judges supposedly interfering in UK law, the Tory refrain appears to be switching back to traditional resentment of British judges and courts thwarting political decisions.Access to judicial review was significantly restricted by the coalition government in 2013 when it tightened the right to use legal aid for challenges. It also raised court fees. The justice secretary at the time, Chris Grayling, said he was determined to drive out “meritless applications” which were used as a “cheap delaying tactic”.The Cabinet Office is overseeing delivery of the constitution, democracy and rights commission which was promised in the Queen’s speech. Any plans to change the judicial review process may well be included the commission’s scope, procedures, personnel and remit have not yet been decided.Amanda Pinto QC, the chair of the Bar Council, said: “Judicial review is a hugely important tool in a democratic society by which decisions of public authorities, including government, are subject to legal scrutiny.”Simon Davis, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales, said: “Judicial Review is a vital part of the checks and balances necessary to protect people from powerful institutions. It underpins the rule of law.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7315c602797951dba6cd93ec57c7aeda674fc5e/232_234_4268_2561/master/4268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=161127bb4b969283108907d1d591f5e8","title":"elisabeth murdoch dismisses bbc director general rumours","story":"Sources say Rupert’s daughter not interested in job, after press reports made her the favourite Elisabeth Murdoch has made clear she has no interest in becoming director general of the BBC, after bookmakers made her the favourite for the role following a string of speculative stories.Murdoch, the daughter of Rupert and a successful media entrepreneur in her own right, was said to be the “surprise contender to become the BBC’s new director general” in an article in the i newspaper, which claimed the appointment would fit with Downing Street’s intentions for the role.The report was followed up around the world and odds of 12 were being offered on her appointment despite the enormous cultural issues that would be involved in hiring the wealthy offspring of one of the BBC’s most fervent critics to save the organisation.Sources close to Murdoch told the  she had no interest at all in the job and was focusing on the launch of a production company, Sister, in addition to her Freelands Foundation charity and a role with Arts Council England. She previously founded and built up the successful independent production company Shine.On Monday the BBC formally opened the application process for the role. A recruitment firm has been employed to find a candidate who can steer the corporation through a tricky licence fee negotiation with a government that has made clear it would like to reduce the scale and funding of the corporation.Potential internal candidates include the BBC Studios boss, Tim Davie, the director of content, Charlotte Moore, and the BBC News editorial director, Kamal Ahmed.The latter emailed staff on Tuesday saying he would no longer be accepting payment for a speaking at an investment company’s conference and apologising for his initial decision.The Mail on Sunday reported that he had agreed to be paid around £12,000 for appearing as a guest on a 40-minute panel at the Aberdeen Standard “Investing for the Future” conference last week.The decision to take the speaking gig angered staff in the news department as Ahmed, who is paid more than £200,000, was part of the team that announced 450 job losses this month. Staff printed off copies of the story and posted them in the newsroom.Ahmed said he was invited in his capacity as a former economics editor. “I realise now that I did not think things through sufficiently at the time of the booking and, although I did not break any of the BBC’s guidelines on external speaking, it was a mistake to agree to a fee. I wanted to say sorry that a mistake made by me has become a public and internal issue,” he said.It is not against the BBC’s rules for senior management to accept external paid speaking gigs, and a spokesperson confirmed that no rules had been broken, but they do not traditionally take such bookings because of the perception that it could create a conflict of interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52e3bffd003c61c7da0768576c2997270ef1d355/0_123_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adde5ce12b3a25255aaf9d3b150f76df","title":"inversia the arctic music festival lighting up perpetual night","story":"In Russia’s frozen far north, Murmansk’s Inversia festival draws artists reflecting on the edges of the earth – including Brits, despite ever chillier diplomatic relationsIn the Arctic Circle during the dim days of February, reality becomes a little attenuated. At 10am, it’s still dark, the streetlights colouring the pavements pale orange and making sallow shadows of the trees. When the forecast announces that today it’ll only be -11C, there’s a palpable sense of relief: someone gruffly makes a joke about global warming. By early afternoon, you’re into dusk, a meditative dwindling and diminishing that makes you wonder if it ever really got light. For what seems an eternity, the sky is rimmed with whitish-pink the snow goes through every shade of blue, from azure and ultramarine through to deep indigo. The sense is that winter has frozen not only the ground, but time itself.Given the sensory intensity, it’s little wonder that the wintry far north has proved so seductive to musicians and artists – or festival organisers. The Dark Music Days gathering in Iceland has been a mainstay of the experimental scene for 40 years, encouraging Europe’s most innovative composers and performers to flock to Reykjavik during late January. More recently, it’s been joined by Svalbard’s Polarjazz festival, Tromso’s Insomnia and at least two separate events, in Canada and Norway, named after the northern lights.The newest of the bunch is Inversia, in the remote Russian settlement of Murmansk, the largest city in the Arctic Circle, which is close to the Norwegian and Finnish borders. Only four years old and just two-and-a-half days long, this boutique event is making a name for itself with a quixotic blend of electronica, jazz and contemporary classical music, lectures, workshops, film, art, and plenty that’s uncategorisable. In cultural terms, winter in Murmansk has traditionally been as dark as the city itself, barring the end-of-January celebration to mark the end of the 40-day polar night – a riot of accordion music, pancakes and ice-dancing. Inversia wants to push things a little further.The name announces this intention to invert expectations, its founders Oleg Khadartsev and Zhanna Guzenko tell me when we catch up in Murmansk’s dour, Soviet-era College of Arts. Both are longterm Murmanskers Khadartsev is a native, while Guzenko’s family moved here when she was a child. In their early 30s and late 20s respectively – a former journalist and a student of international relations – they considered doing as many of their friends did, and getting the hell out as soon as they could (from a peak of half a million before the collapse of communism, Murmank’s population is now something like 300,000).Instead they decided to dig in. Khadartsev set up a small producing hub, Fridaymilk Guzenko started curating her own projects. In 2017, they launched Inversia, describing it as an “audiovisual” festival to keep their options open. The idea was to connect and showcase artists from across the high north.“But really we had no idea what it would be,” says Khardartsev with a slow grin. Guzenko cuts in: “It sometimes feels as if we still don’t. Everything comes together only at the last minute.”That DIY sensibility animates Inversia’s programming, which leans into the improvisational and the anarchic. In addition to that Soviet concert hall, lined in wood and dominated by dour portraits of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov (“incredible, isn’t it,” Khardartsev sighs), this year’s venues include several hotel bars, a local cinema, Murmansk Regional Scientific Library and the city’s number 11 bus route (the latter is part of an acoustic installation called Just Take Time to Listen, by the Russian artist Gleb Glonti).A lecture by a local philosopher on the darkness of the city sits cheek by jowl with a “sonification” project generating audio from migration statistics. DJs from Switzerland and Denmark rub shoulders with film-makers from Norway and Finland. Audiences come from similarly far-flung locations: in addition to people who had flown in from abroad and a sizable squad of locals, some had driven from Finland and Norway, eight-plus hours on wintry roads. Boutique though it is, Inversia is on a roll. Last year, Guzenko and Khadartsev estimate that around 5,000 people came this year, it’ll likely be near 8,000.Everything I experienced over the weekend emphasised the porousness of boundaries – between light and dark, classical and ambient electronics, art forms, nation states. For me, the stars of the jazz programme were the young Minsk-based trio Soyuz, who referenced severe krautrock and 80s-style synths but coloured them with sunny doses of Europop, courtesy of their male lead singer’s sugary-sweet vocals (soyuz meaning “union”, perhaps ironically given Belarus’s struggles to escape Russian influence).The night before, one of the late-night sets featured a duo called Glava II, whose collaborators hail, respectively, from the Murmansk region and St Petersburg, a thousand miles south. Billed as offering “darkwave, techno and folklore”, the pair conjured ominous low roars and screeching howls from bass and live electronics. The folkloric elements passed me by, but dark it undeniably was.Courtesy of the British Council, two British acts even made it on to the bill: the post-classical composer Roly Porter, and the hotly tipped Belfast-based jazz group Robocobra Quartet, led by drummer-vocalist Chris Ryan. After playing a taut, incantatory set that got the crowd into full pogo mode, Ryan seemed bemused to make it this far north, having just played dates in Moscow and St Petersburg. “It’s amazing to make it up here, and for people to be so welcoming,” he said. “Northern people make their own warmth.”For their own part, Khadartsev and Gulzenko encourage the artists to reflect on the idea of what it means to make work at the ends of the earth. “It’s about the environment, the way we express ourselves,” reflects Gulzenko. “The space is heard on different frequencies.” Khadartsev is nodding: “The darkness is a reason to look inside. It’s a kind of meditation if you find your way, you can go deep.”The British Council’s presence here is in itself a minor miracle. Officially, the organisation was told to “cease operations” by the Russian state during the diplomatic fallout from the Salisbury poisonings in 2018. But a core team set up shop inside the British Embassy in Moscow, and has carried on with, if anything, more energy than before. Their involvement with Inversia is part of an ongoing UK–Russia Year of Music, which has seen some 200 events, over 400 British artists and cultural leaders visiting locations across Russia, and exchanges involving in excess of 1,500 Russian musicians and ensembles. Though the British Council officially doesn’t exist in the country, it continues collaborating as best it can – including with some of the ministries that asked it to leave. “A very Russian compromise,” its director, Michael Bird, tells me.Up in Murmansk, Guzenko and Khadartsev’s collaborations with the community that surrounds them is perhaps the most distinctive aspect of what they’re doing. Unlike too many festivals, which cater to peripatetic, multinational artists and audiences – this week Helskinki, next month Rome – Inversia seems determined to look after its roots. One of the premieres at this year’s festival featured the Russian composer and sound artist Ilia Pucheglazov, who performs under the name Symphocat, and the Barents Kamerata, a scratch chamber group drawn from the local symphony orchestra and students.In a piece called Dedication to the North, Pucheglazov offered sampled field recordings of wave noise, footsteps scrunching through snow, tectonic grumblings, and wind whipping across what sounded like a frozen tundra. Alongside these atmospherics, and sometimes over them, the string players contributed slow-moving ice floes of sound, in the manner of Philip Glass or Nils Frahm. Musically, it wasn’t the most demanding experience, but witnessing the delight of the players at having participated in a work like this more than made up for it.And music, perhaps, wasn’t the only point. On my last afternoon in Murmansk, during a break in the blizzard, I headed out to experience Glonti’s urban acoustic intervention, Just Take Time to Listen, carrying a map bearing the locations it was taking place in. Initially, I was stumped: despite standing, as requested, inside the door of the railway station and by the sea terminal, there was no sign of speakers or any hint of an installation, acoustic or otherwise.Then, as the light came down, the penny dropped: Glonti was asking me to listen to the particular sonic textures of the city itself. I tried again, closing my eyes and trying to ignore the cold seeping into my fingers. Heard from a railway bridge, there was the rasp of a worker’s shovel scraping snow, mingling with the grumbling of container lifts at the seaport and the occasional distinctive toy-like whistle of a Russian train. By the arts college, there was the rustle of fir trees and the churning swoosh of cars negotiating ice, in counterpoint to the foghorn-like vocals of a busker yelling his way through 1970s Russian rock. I’d never quite heard anything like it.• The Inversia festival is held in Murmansk every year. The UK–Russia Year of Music continues until the end of March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bf2a94165bec9c58d6122dd54d8f5b7eb440d/0_87_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4d07a1285c6c095c164e83654dca54e","title":"friends across the divide does labour have room for blairism and corbynism","story":"Peter Mandelson and Steve Howell represent the two opposite poles of the Labour party: one was a key architect of Blairism, the other of Corbynism.

There will not be general open-ended ongoing equivalence in financial services, nor other management or financial agreements with the United Kingdom,” Barnier said. “We will keep control of these tools, and we will retain the free-hand to take our own decisions.”Negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU are due to start in the first week of March.At the end of the transition period, the British financial services sector will no longer have the right to operate in the EU as it does today.The City will instead rely on Brussels judging that the UK’s regulations and supervisory systems are sufficiently robust – a so-called equivalence decision that can be overturned with as little as 30 days’ notice.The document photographed outside Downing Street said that Javid would instead be seeking “comprehensive, permanent equivalence decisions”, according to a report in the Financial Times.Such an equivalence deal could mean foreign companies such as investment firms and clearing houses can serve European customers largely from their home base and avoid having to set up a subsidiary in the EU.Barnier told MEPs that Brussels would not even engage in talks on the topic let alone be open to granting such a deal.He said: “We are not negotiating on these topics, rather we are checking that there is consistency and wherever possible granting equivalence on particular sectors of the financial industry.“That’s what we did with Canada, that’s what we did with the United States. It works. So I don’t see why it shouldn’t work with the United Kingdom.”While all the focus on Brexit talks has been on goods, the financial services chapter in any trade deal is critical for the UK. It employs more than 1 million people and contributes £127bn to the economy, according to Javid in an article in City AM on Tuesday.“We hope to agree a chapter on financial services in the UK-EU free trade agreement that establishes a baseline for the trading relationship,” the chancellor said.“If the EU, like us, wants a durable relationship, we should also include measures to directly address the long-term needs of industry for a reliable equivalence process.”He said this offered “the best solution to the question of agreeing our relationship with the EU this year” and was “important not only in the short term, but to establish the norms and ways of working with the EU that will endure for the decades to come”.The photograph of the briefing paper sets out two possible “landing zones” in talks with the EU.One would involve “selective equivalence” and a side deal committing to a “joint declaration on cooperation” which would kick in if the deal the government hopes to conclude by the end of the year does not include financial services.The second “landing zone” would be a “time-limited” agreement on financial services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de72dd18250f6eac8a41254bb2061dc4f1f030e1/0_177_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3586ac49351fffdc85c1a35d6fc89fca","title":"dominic cummings answers hs2 questions with pj masks quotes","story":"Adviser references children’s TV show when asked about decision to proceed with HS2Dominic Cummings has further burnished his reputation as – depending on your view – gnomic sage or patronising troll by replying to a journalist’s questions on HS2 with a series of cryptic replies referring to a children’s TV show.Boris Johnson’s chief adviser was stopped by a BBC crew as he left his north London home on Tuesday morning, and asked about the government’s decision to proceed with HS2, a project Cummings has opposed.Cummings replied: “The night time is the right time to fight crime – I can’t think of a rhyme.” The lines come from the theme tune for PJ Masks, a cartoon series about a trio of pre-schoolers who, when their parents are asleep, don costumes to battle similarly youthful foes.Based on a series of French children’s books called Les Pyjamasques, the show is produced by a number of TV companies from the UK, US and France, and has a range of spin-off merchandise.Asked by the BBC journalist if the decision on HS2 meant he had lost influence in No 10, Cummings replied: “I think we need PJ Masks on the job.” Pressed again on the project, he ostentatiously checked his phone for a while before adding: “PJ Masks.

Can anything be done to end the gridlock and pollution?High Holborn on a bleak winter morning is a portrait of traffic hell. Vehicles grind east to west through an orange maze of construction and utility works. John Lewis and Argos trucks jostle with Thames Water vehicles at one point, a flood of white vans appears in sequence, as if a fleet controller had ordered an invasion of the West End of London. Black-cab drivers lean on their steering wheels for support one holds his head in his hands. The last passenger on a static number 8 bus hovers by the doors, hoping forlornly that the driver will release him into the streets.In the few visible cars, there are no-smoking stickers that identify them as rides for hire. In the melee, one type of vehicle seems almost completely absent: the private car.“London has achieved the impossible by eradicating the private car – and still having desperate traffic congestion,” says Prof Tony Travers, the director of LSE London, a research centre at the London School of Economics that explores the city’s economic and social concerns. “People keep saying we need to get the cars off the road. In central London, there aren’t any.”The idea of blocking cars from urban centres is catching on fast, accelerated by concerns over air pollution and the climate emergency. Brighton is the latest city to propose a zone where private car journeys are banned. Among others, York is considering barring cars within its medieval walls Bristol will exclude diesel cars from a central area between 7am and 3pm Birmingham is developing a plan to stop people driving through the city centre and Cardiff wants to introduce a congestion charge.London brought in such a fee 17 years ago. “The congestion charge sealed the deal … but traffic wardens, bus lanes and double-yellow lines were a gradual deterrent before that,” says the transport historian Christian Wolmar. In the late 60s and 70s, a young Wolmar would drive his Austin 1100 from Kensington and park off Oxford Street or Pall Mall, to go to John Lewis in the day or the cinema by night as a child, he would sometimes accompany his father when he drove into town to work near Berkeley Square. “I don’t think I ever saw him on a bus.”However, Wolmar says the experience was “pretty nightmarish”: “There was no ‘golden age’ when there was no traffic. I could spend half an hour around Marble Arch. The last time I drove into central London was in the 90s, to go to a Chinese restaurant. That culture of being able to drive and park wherever you like no longer exists.”According to Peter Ackroyd’s book London: The Biography, vehicles in the city moved at approximately 12mph in late Victorian times, before mass car ownership, when the streets were “filled with the ceaseless incessant stream of horse-drawn, motor-driven and steam-propelled traffic”. By 2018, the average speed on A roads in the City and Westminster was about 8mph. So why is traffic moving more slowly than ever?Among most analysts, there is consensus on two underlying reasons: more vans and more Ubers. But in case we should feel righteously smug, Travers adds a list of contributors to the gridlock: “Cycle lanes, in some places, are bad. Ubiquitous four-way pedestrian crossing. Wider pavements. Any one of those makes perfect sense inidually. But the buses are completely screwed.”The bus easily outstrips the tube and rail as the main mode of transport for Londoners – even more so among disabled people, those with mobility problems and the poorest residents. Frozen prices, plus the introduction in 2016 of the hopper fare, which allows unlimited journeys within one hour for the cost of one trip, have made buses even cheaper under the current mayor, Sadiq Khan. However, the network has shrunk and patronage has declined in the past four years.About a quarter of London buses are run by the Go-Ahead Group. David Brown, its chief executive, says: “London lost a lot of passengers in 2015-16 because the speed of my number 11 bus was 4mph. You could walk faster than that. Increasing congestion is the biggest problem we face. Congestion has such a negative impact. Air quality worsens. The slower buses go, the more people get out of them and get into the car, and the slower it will go. All you get is more traffic idling, belching out fumes.”Figures from the Department for Transport show that traffic speeds have declined across Britain over the past decade, particularly in urban areas. Recovery from the financial crisis, plus cheap credit deals, has meant more cars on the road.Tackling that is a headache, as Brown knows. In a previous job at TfL, he tried to curb the numbers of delivery vehicles coming into London before the Olympics, when fears of gridlock were at their height. “I was looking at Amazon, then I realised there were a hundred and one people delivering to my own building every second. Just trying to get 11 floors and 2,500 people working for TfL to change their behaviour was hard enough.”Some of these deliveries were personal items others were the result of various departments ordering their own photocopying paper, which arrived at different floors at different times. TfL had some success consolidating these trips, “but it was really hard yards, down in the detail”. Meanwhile, Brown says, “Regent Street had 36 different operators doing recycling. Each person was doing the right thing, but add them all up together …”The boom in urban construction – most visibly the spate of skyscrapers in the Square Mile – has also been a factor. “They generate trips,” says Calderato. “There’s a lot of road space needed for the construction traffic.” Adjacent roads can be ripped up to ert utilities, creating more roadworks. Once these buildings are built, the lifts need to be maintained, the offices need to be serviced – and, of course, there will be many deliveries.If Amazon and co is one villain of congestion, another is Uber and its imitators. After the ride-hailing app reached London in 2013, the number of licensed private-hire vehicles surged, from 49,800 to 87,400 by 2017.Uber says it is committed to reducing inidual car ownership and points out it has recently integrated public transport information into its app. Its car-pooling option is used by 350,000 Londoners, which a spokesman said saved 1.7m miles driven last year.McNamara points to a junction on the edge of the congestion zone, opposite St Pancras station. “Camden make the decision to close the top of Judd St. As a result of stopping that infinitesimal bit of traffic, the traffic lights can’t cope with the right turn vehicles now have to make. People come two hours whizzing on the Eurostar from Paris and spend 40 minutes waiting to cross the Euston Road in a taxi.”Traffic is monitored from TfL’s Palestra building in Southwark and controlled, to some extent, through an automated system known as Scoot, which adapts the signals on key roads and junctions. A 10-year, multimillion-pound contract for an upgrade, Future Scoot, was given to Siemens in 2018. TfL claims it will maximise road space McNamara is unconvinced. “They place too much emphasis on Scoot, which was a panacea and going to solve all our problems, but hasn’t,” he says. “The borough is doing one thing, the mayor is doing something else and it all crumbles around us.”Cycle lanes are also an uncomfortable topic. The construction of cycle superhighways in 2015 and 2016, in particular, coincided with buses almost grinding to a halt. While Brown backs cycling, he says: “In the end, you’ve taken road space away from buses. We’ve accommodated.”McNamara is less restrained. “We’re being polluted because nothing is moving,” he says. “That’s why no one is getting on buses now – it’s quicker to walk. Then they say the answer is to build more cycle lanes. No!” For McNamara, there is a clear class dimension to the debate: “The myth of the anti-car lobby is that it’s someone in a Rolls-Royce flicking cigar ash out of the window at the cyclists. It’s the working class that are driving the commercial vehicles in central London, and they are being forced out by the wealthy inner-London elite, who can afford to live in Islington and want to ride their bike to St Pancras. They want to sit in Oxford Circus and drink their skinny caramel coconut latte without any thought about how the constituent parts got there. And they want something, they buy it on their phone and they expect it delivered the next day.”But then, as Travers says: “The truth is that almost everyone using the streets – cabs, buses, pedestrians and cyclists – has a sense of entitlement.”But perhaps the ambition to eradicate congestion is doomed. “London has very limited street space, and a lot of demand for that space,” says Calderato. However, Ollie More, a policy officer at the sustainable transport charity Sustrans, argues that being a non-driver doesn’t exclude people like him from the pain of traffic – be it on a slow bus or while cycling to work. “I go a long, convoluted route to be safe, so it takes a long time. We all feel it the same.”He says that, of the 6.8m private vehicle trips made daily in Greater London, 4.2m could be walked or cycled. Meanwhile, Manchester has unveiled plans for a walking and cycling network to outstrip London’s – a 1,800-mile protected space for active journeys in a city where one-third of car trips cover a distance shorter than 1km.One day, the concept of vehicle congestion may feel outmoded. “In terms of reducing congestion and using space efficiently, walking is the best mode of transport,” More says. “Cycling is five times more efficient at moving people than a standard traffic lane. With the health benefits, tackling the climate emergency and air pollution challenges, it’s ticking multiple boxes. We need a culture shift.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband. The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account.

The use of a short audio loop taken from his much-loved Four Seasons concerto as the much-hated hold music for the Department for Work and Pensions’ helplines, has not been great, reputationally, for him or the DWP. As the protesting benefit claimant Daniel Blake in Ken Loach’s eponymous film, ground down by hunger, desperation and interminable unproductive calls to DWP call centres spray paints on to the walls of his local jobcentre: “... And change the shite music on the phones!“The DWP has now, thankfully, changed the helpline music – after 14 years and lots of complaints. But this was never about the music itself, rather its misuse. Replacing Vivaldi was a relatively tiny policy change in the great scheme of DWP things, but it nonetheless provides an interesting case study, offering wider lessons for anyone interested in how government works: why did the DWP get it wrong in the first place? Why was it resistant to putting things right when people complained? And how was it finally persuaded to change its mind?Choosing the Spring section of Four Seasons as hold music in 2006 must have seemed a no-brainer. The music is lovely, is it not? The opening movements are so regal, strident, impressive. What could be more perfectly redolent of a great British institution like the DWP than a constant 30-second loop projecting timeless grandeur and authority? Plus it was free, thanks to a licensing agreement. Fair enough, up to a point. That no one was thinking about the people who had to listen to the loop for long periods did not seem to be an issue at the time. When users of the helplines started to complain that the experience was aural torture, however, nothing happened. Simply reporting to your DWP call-centre operative that half an hour of repetitive Vivaldi loops caused you to feel tense and anxious got you nowhere. The complaint might be passed on, but it would get lost in the system. If it got through, policy managers would shrug it off as “anecdotal opinion”. We know what we are doing, was the implicit message. And anyway, how could our “customers” not like this lovely music?The breakthrough came from outside the DWP. Through its hosting of the Office for Disability Issues (which has since moved to the Cabinet Office), the department was involved in cross-government discussions on autism policy. Crucially, these meetings involved ordinary people with autism. This led to the reframing of the Vivaldi problem as an issue of the health of autistic benefit claimants, and their right to positively access public services.A DWP-commissioned report by one of those lived-experience experts proved why long exposure to the Vivaldi loops could be toxic to people on the autism spectrum. Loud, repetitive chunks of music could overstimulate and create sensory overload, resulting in pain and disorientation. Fears of not having the call answered at all were heightened. Some callers were so traumatised by 40 minutes on hold that when they finally got through they were unable to properly explain why they had rung in the first place – and the call was terminated.Callers now get a 20-minute repetition-free blend of tracks that promise a “steady, neutral pace”. The new on-hold music aspires, in the words of an internal DWP report, to ensure the caller no longer feels the DWP is ”simply trying to make them go away”. Not everyone is convinced that the problem has been solved. The spoken prompts – such as those that encourage waiting callers to hang up and get in touch online, when it is often online failure that has triggered the call in the first place – are said to be especially aggravating.It is to the DWP’s credit, however, that it finally listened to its “customers” and acted on what it heard. What wider lessons might it learn? Find ways to listen to more people with experience of the system, including your frontline staff. Be open to change. Don’t assume you have all the answers.

The young Surrey off-spinner says educating their parents is keyWhile England’s Test squad for Sri Lanka may suggest a paucity of spin options at present, an offie who can be filed under “one for the future” is currently with the Lions in Australia looking to reignite a career that stumbled a touch last year.Amar Virdi may be only 21 but is already a title winner, having been an ever-present in the Surrey team that was unstoppable in 2018 and contributed 39 wickets to the cause. It is not just the patka and beard that made this young Sikh so eye-catching this is a finger spinner who gives the ball a proper rip.But the strains of that breakout campaign led to a stress issue in his lower back and while it did clear up over the winter, Virdi was then omitted for the first nine matches of last season because his overall fitness had fallen below an acceptable standard.Alec Stewart, Surrey’s director of cricket, spoke of a player in need of some “tough love” and after a spell with Darren Veness, the club’s hulking great fitness coach, a more slimline Virdi returned in July with a bang, snaring 14 Nottinghamshire wickets in a spin-fest at Trent Bridge.Though most eyes at the time were on the mind-bending World Cup final at Lord’s, and his season was more quiet thereafter, it was the type of performance that highlighted why Virdi has been talked about as a future international since he first started playing first-XI club cricket aged 13.Now in the Lions set-up for the three-match tour that begins against a Cricket Australia XI in Hobart on Saturday – albeit sitting behind Dom Bess, who after an encouraging recall in South Africa bounces on to Sri Lanka – Virdi is determined to show the coaches how much he wants truly wants it.“Last season was, well, different. I was pretty sad and upset at missing games after the year we had before but I think good comes from bad,” Virdi told the  before his departure for Australia, spinning an apple in his hand by force of habit.“I know I have to be in the best possible shape. I don’t want to let my teammates down by not being able to make a catch or bowl 50 overs in a match.“So yes, it hurt. But I want to play Test cricket and be in the best shape come the fifth day to win the game for my team. I’ve been training hard and watching what I eat. It’s been a case of getting into the mindset of a professional athlete. I want to make sure that it’s not spoken about again.”The Lions tour follows Virdi’s attendance at a pre-Christmas spin camp in Mumbai, where along with Bess and Mason Crane, he worked with Rangana Herath. That experience opened his eyes to the smarts required on the subcontinent, chiefly the varied use of the crease and release points that brought the Sri Lankan great 433 Test victims.Virdi is rightly patient at present, knowing he remains raw, but also serious about his Test ambitions. “I’m sure it will come.” he says. If so, he would be only the third Sikh to do so with England after Monty Panesar and Ravi Bopara. It was, however, two other cricketers who fired his imagination as a child.Virdi said: “Saqlain Mushtaq was a role model for me and I have been lucky to work with him for the past six to eight years with Surrey and England. And I loved watching Harbhajan Singh as a kid. It was his charisma and his energy – and the fact he ragged it square.“And it was also his style. He was almost like someone doing a painting – it was like artwork, the way his arms glided. It looked effortless but with so much control.“And there was also his relatability. As a young Sikh boy, there was Monty Panesar in England but not many others. So it was exciting for me, seeing a guy who looks like me bowling off-spin in Test cricket.”Virdi describes himself as “blessed’ to be born into the Sikh faith and speaks of his appearance as a “uniform” that comes with responsibility. With this comes a desire to show other Sikhs, and the British Asian community that makes up a third of the recreational game, they too can make it.The son of immigrants from East Africa – his father, Raj, came to the UK from Kenya to study, while his mother, Harmeet, was part of the Indian exodus from Idi Amin’s regime in Uganda – Virdi first turned out for Indian Gymkhana in Osterley before moving to Sunbury CC at the start of his teens.That type of switch, instigated by his father, was one that Virdi believes other British Asians must be open to. Though he turned down private school scholarships to stay at the state-funded Guru Nanak Sikh Academy near his family home in Hounslow, Virdi fancies the move from a predominantly Asian club to one with more established county connections was key to being spotted.Virdi said: “In terms of the Asian conundrum – or whatever it is called these days – there needs to be more education for parents, I think. We have seen Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Monty Panesar, Ravi Bopara – it’s not that British Asians can’t make it through, it’s more knowing how the system works.“My dad was very switched on and could see what I needed to do. Sunbury was a club that Middlesex and Surrey both look at and they have had 10 or so professionals come through. Sometimes guys are reluctant to leave Asian clubs. And it can be daunting.”Virdi’s mature outlook likely comes from being immersed in adult cricket so young, such that he is not a cricketer who looks for excuses even when, for example, his trade as a specialist first-class spinner must be performed in the spring then autumn competition that is the County Championship.He added: “Pitches don’t bother me. I’ve played games at the start of the season where it has spun. This tour of Australia with the Lions, they say off-spinners don’t thrive there but I’m looking forward to some hard surfaces and bounce. You are always learning, you’re never the finished article.“The journey can take time or be fast.

The billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has skipped the New Hampshire primary, and yet he could still prove to be one of the contest’s big winners.Final polls showed the veteran senator Bernie Sanders in pole position in the state, with a pack of “moderates” jostling behind him. That’s precisely the scenario – in which Democratic moderates fail to unite behind a single challenger to Sanders and his message of revolutionary change – on which Bloomberg’s presidential bid is predicated. So long as neither the former vice-president Joe Biden, the former mayor Pete Buttigieg nor the senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar manage to break decisively from the rest of the pack, Bloomberg can see a way to overtake them all.Bloomberg is not relying on brute financial force alone. On the contrary, his broadcast and social media campaign has been fought with considerable elan. The former mayor, who first won office in New York as a Republican, can claim to have produced the best ad of the Democratic field, one that intercuts archive footage of oratorical flights by past presidents from John F Kennedy to Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama with expletive-laden abuse from the current occupant of the Oval Office. In less than 30 seconds, Bloomberg’s ad makes the case that Trump is unfit to be president.He’s also told the best joke of the 2020 campaign. Asked whether it would be healthy for a presidential election to be fought between two billionaires, Bloomberg replied: “Who’s the other one?”That hits at a Trump weak spot: the president is famously insecure about his wealth, boasting of a fortune in the high billions that he does not quite have. Bloomberg, by contrast, is thought to be the 14th-richest person in the world with an estimated fortune of $58bn. Some Democrats believe that the prospect of facing Bloomberg in November would unnerve Trump, that the former mayor would get under his skin.Trump’s most devoted supporters have certainly picked up that animus. “He’s a blowhole, he thinks he can buy his way into the presidency,” was the assessment of Bloomberg offered by Donna, one of the many thousands of Trump fans who queued in the cold on Monday night to attend a Trump rally in downtown Manchester, staged to ensure the Democrats did not have the New Hampshire spotlight to themselves. “He’s got nothing to offer except billions of dollars. He doesn’t love America.”And yet those billions of dollars are proving effective. Normally skipping the first four state contests would doom a presidential candidacy to failure, depriving it of early momentum and publicity. But by spending at a rate of $38 a second, Bloomberg has ensured his name is mentioned at least as frequently as any of those who’ve spent the last weeks and months trekking through snowstorms to speak in diners and high school gyms across this frozen corner of New England. In the words of David Plouffe, who masterminded Obama’s victorious campaign in 2008: “We’ve never seen anything like it.”A second brake on Bloomberg’s hopes is surely his own limitations as a candidate. While TV ads can make him look like a titan, the reality can be disappointing – and not only because of his diminutive stature. (Trump has already branded him “Mini-Mike”.) He’s not a charismatic performer, more technocrat than politician. Which is one reason why senior Democrats suspect he will skip participation in the Democratic TV debates, even if he clears the qualifying threshold.But the primary worry is that should Bloomberg somehow win the Democratic nomination, passionate Sanders supporters could withhold their support, just as many refused to back Hillary Clinton in 2016. Shifting from Sanders, the scourge of Wall Street, to Bloomberg, a luminary of high finance, would surely be a compromise too far.And yet those waving placards for the Vermont senator at an eve-of-poll rally on a university campus in Rindge on Monday, were unexpectedly accommodating towards the billionaire candidate.“He’s competent,” conceded Aquino Loayza, while Brett Zografos said that if Bloomberg were his party’s eventual nominee, “I’d vote for him. He will champion policies that fit with me more than Trump.”It hardly sounds likely. In fact, everything about Bloomberg’s candidacy is unlikely. But, as the events of the last four years have shown, that’s no disqualification at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43fd095f14a4bef48ad945743fc8c4529491f876/0_98_3541_2125/master/3541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ba3f097f9666a7465ac05754f46c4e5","title":"pete buttigieg gay democrats poll reaction","story":"The ex-mayor’s sexual orientation barely registered with voters – until now, as some LGBTQ+ millennials point to a distinction between being gay and being queerOutside Salem high school, where Pete Buttigieg was attending a town hall rally on Sunday evening, fans could take their pick between oversized pins of the presidential nominee silhouetted against a rainbow flag, or the stars and stripes. There was a “Pride for Pete” pin, and a “Give Pete a Chance” pin. There were T-shirts screen-printed with Princess Leia, and the words “We are the Resistance”, a nod, perhaps, to the debunked rumor that Buttigieg once planned to change the name of South Bend, Indiana, where he was mayor until this year, to Sith Bend. And there were sweatshirts helpfully emblazoned with a phonetic spelling of the candidate’s family name: “Boot Edge Edge”.Buttigieg used to joke about having a name that can be difficult to pronounce, but if it was ever an electoral handicap that time is past. He enters the New Hampshire primary today a close second to Bernie Sanders after winning Iowa. Is it a blip? For those crowded into Salem high school, with George Michael’s Freedom pumping from the loudspeakers, Buttigieg was the real deal, a candidate who could take on Donald Trump – and win.Buttigieg’s name was always the least of his challenges, of course. But what’s remarkable is how little his biggest challenge – his sexual orientation – has appeared to register, until now. A poll last October found that almost four in 10 Americans felt the country was not ready for a gay president, but at the Salem event attendees seemed baffled that it would be an issue at all. “That’s not what this is about,” said Sandy Thomas, a Buttigieg supporter. “It’s about who is going to lead our country.” Kevin Brown, from Windham, agreed. “I don’t care about his gender or sexual orientation: can he be our next president can he reunite us with our allies and bring more common sense to the White House?”Ironically, the question of Buttigieg’s sexuality may be less of an issue for older, moderate voters like those at the Salem event, than for young millennials. Harrison Ivins, a 20-year-old who had grown up in Tennessee, and identified as a Republican until Trump’s election, acknowledged being an anomaly as a young gay Buttigieg supporter. “While he is a member of the LGBTQ community, a lot of people don’t view him as being radically queer,” he said. “I think there’s a distinction between what makes somebody gay and what makes somebody queer,” he added. “Being gay is about who you love, it’s not your identity being queer is much more about how you define yourself, so I think there’s an aspect of being queer which is visible, it’s not something you can hide.”For Ivins, Buttigieg was gay, but he was not queer. This might seem like semantics to older, and straight, voters, but for some millennials it matters. They see a candidate who makes a virtue of traditional institutions with often deeply homophobic histories – such as when photos emerged of Buttigieg soliciting donations, in 2017, for the Salvation Army. It’s not that Buttigieg, who came out publicly in 2015 – the year that the supreme court voted in favor of marriage equality – is downplaying his sexual orientation. His husband, Chasten, has been a visible presence on the campaign trail, and in Salem on Sunday the largest cheer came when he brandished his wedding ring, but the campaign’s emphasis has often been on Buttigieg’s military service in Afghanistan and his faith. To a lot of people, that looks like assimilation. Is it possible that we have reached a stage where a gay candidate for president could lose a critical demographic for not being gay enough?In an irony that appears to have passed under the radar, LGBTQ+ millennials are largely flocking to Bernie Sanders, a 79-year-old straight white man. Meanwhile, Buttigieg, the only viable millennial among the candidates, is doing strongest with those aged 60 and over. According to a poll in late January, more than one in three LGTBQ+ voters support Sanders. He was followed by Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, with Buttigieg trailing in fourth place.“What is a gay candidate supposed to look like?” asked Alex Halpern Levy, a Democratic speechwriter who supports Buttigieg. “Should he wear Balenciaga sneakers? I’ve heard people criticize the fact that Pete sometimes wears brown shoes with a navy suit. In the staid world of politics, that passes as a gay aesthetic.” Levy suggested the millennial backlash was primarily a social media phenomenon. “Pete is decried as an assimilationist, but it’s the culture of assimilation that allows gay Twitter to say they care more about the big revolution or structural change than supporting a historic gay candidacy,” he said. “If you are a gay kid in suburban Ohio, you are inspired by Pete’s campaign.”That may be true, but it’s also in states such as Ohio where Buttigieg may have to play down his sexual orientation – or, per the advice of Johnnie Cordero, the chair of the Black Caucus for South Carolina Democrats, not “flaunt” it – a trigger word for generations of gay men who were forced to hide their identity. To win votes over Biden he’ll have to find a way to secure socially conservative Democrats, like the woman in Iowa captured on video trying to change her vote after learning that Buttigieg was gay. At one point, after paraphrasing the Bible, she asked: “How come this has never been brought out before?”As primary season kicks into high gear, McNary, who is black and gay, finds himself wondering if history will repeat itself should Buttigieg become the Democratic nominee. Although he admires Buttigieg, who he considers the smartest candidate in the race, he is sticking by Biden for now. “I worry they would wait another four years rather than vote for a gay man,” he said. “My priority is getting Trump out of office.”If Buttigieg does well in New Hampshire and then consolidates his success on Super Tuesday, skeptics like McNary may be persuaded to switch allegiance. After Iowa, there was a palpable sense that many Americans were contemplating, for the first time, the possibility of having an out gay pesident. What does it take to turn a possibility into an inevitability? “To see a gay candidate standing in front of a national audience claiming victory in Iowa, was a very emotional experience,” recalled Fred Karger, a political strategist. “I started crying.”Although now largely forgotten, Karger was the first openly gay candidate to run for president, in 2012, when he stood for the Republican nomination. Largely self-funded, Karger tied his entire campaign to his sexual orientation, holding town hall meetings in gay bars, and distributing frisbees and business cards emblazoned with the words “Fred Who?” His aim, he said, was to use the platform of televised debates to illuminate the Republican party’s appalling record on LGBTQ+ rights.In the end Karger didn’t make any debates. He came in ninth place in New Hampshire, with 346 votes, just ahead of Tea Party favorite Michele Bachmann, and withdrew from the race in June. But eight years is a long time. Karger was an early supporter of Buttigieg, after turning up to see him speak at a Brooklyn library last February. Since then he has seen Buttigieg go from “Pete Who?” to a household name.At his gym in Orange county last week, Karger was watching the New Hampshire debate, when a man came in and switched the channel to Fox News. “I asked to switch it back to the debate, and he started working out and listening to what was being said,” Karger recalled. “And then he nodded to Pete on the screen and said: ‘I like that guy.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cae3d56079ee98e3f5c2ebd29b61a6ed0da78b0/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae8ca3de68eac0c5a58ba2898f00c3cf","title":"bernie sanders pete buttigieg new hampshire vote polls results democratic elections joe biden","story":"After deleting a tweet calling Michael Bloomberg “racist” (see earlier), Donald Trump sent a new tweet with the same charge (see earlier). Bloomberg has responded in a statement:“President Trump’s deleted tweet is the latest example of his endless efforts to ide Americans.” Bloomberg says.He said Trump “inherited a country marching towards greater equality and ided us with racist appeals and hateful rhetoric. The challenge of the moment is clear: We must confront this president and do everything we can to defeat him. The president’s attack on me clearly reflects his fear over the growing strength of my campaign. “Make no mistake Mr. President: I am not afraid of you and I will not let you bully me or anyone else in America. Between now and November, I will do everything I can to defeat you whether I am on the ballot or not.”Bill Gardner, who as secretary of state has presided over elections in New Hampshire since 1976, told the  he was confident that there would be no repeat of last week’s fiasco in Iowa - not least because New Hampshire has kept things old school, relying on paper ballots. “You can’t hack a pencil,” he said. Voters “make their mark on the ballot. They know what the mark is and if there’s a recount they can see their mark there.”He spoke as he toured the state’s polling places, visiting the small town of Windsor, home to just 110 registered voters - and where the same wooden ballot box has been in continuous use since 1892, a state record.Among those voting in Windsor was retired college professor and Korea war veteran Jack Steeves. He cast his vote in the Republican primary, not for Donald Trump but by writing in the name of Mitt Romney - as a protest against the president. “I would never vote for this president,” Steeves said. “He’s a bad man. I have three daughters and eight grand daughters: I wouldn’t want him anywhere near them.”His wife, Pat, a retired dental nurse, voted in the Democratic contest - and for Pete Buttigieg. “I think we need someone younger and more presidential.”Long way to go yet and anything might happen but with Bernie Sanders looking strong in New Hampshire the Democratic party is in a face-to-face encounter with the prospect of its presidential nomination going to a politician not well trusted or liked in the party establishment.“I have a lot of faith in this party,” Senate Democratic stalwart Dick Durbin tells CNN:Jill and Joe Biden to Travel to South Carolina, Join Cedric Richmond for Launch PartyThis evening, on Tuesday, February 11, Jill and Joe Biden will travel to Columbia, South Carolina and join Campaign Co-Chair and Congressman Cedric Richmond of Louisiana for a South Carolina launch party. Later this evening, Jill and Joe Biden will address their New Hampshire supporters via livestream while Valerie Biden Owens will thank supporters in person for the hard work they poured into the campaign.“I have enjoyed traveling across New Hampshire, speaking to countless Granite Staters who understand we are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I have relished fighting for each and every one of their votes” said Vice President Joe Biden. “I am looking forward to traveling to South Carolina this evening and Nevada later this week to carry our campaign forward and hear from the erse voters whose voices must be heard in this process to select the Democratic nominee who will unite this country to defeat Donald Trump.”Joe Biden is pulling up his stakes from New Hampshire and heading tonight to South Carolina, he has told supporters.“My message is that I’ve got to get to South Carolina,” Biden told reporters.After a fourth-place finish in Iowa, Biden has been polling behind his rivals in the Granite State and is banking on strong showing in the next two races, in South Carolina and Nevada, to show some viability before the Super Tuesday races. He has told supporters that he’s in the race for the long haul.Donald Trump deleted his first tweet accusing Michael Bloomberg of being “racist” – see post at 9.03am US ET – but he’s duly gone there again, this time wrapped in a jacket of puerile golf-based abuse:It’s usually worth looking at the accounts the president chooses to retweet. In this case, it’s Samuel Finkelstein, aka @CancelSam, “a political activist, writer, and student at Seton Hall Law School” who wanted this to happen:In short recap, the #BloombergIsRacist hashtag refers to video from 2015 now circulating online in which the former New York City mayor discusses in stark terms the stop-and-frisk policy he pursued in office which critics say was racist. The Aspen Times reported then that Bloomberg asked that the footage not be released. Thanks to a podcaster, it is now loose.Bloomberg is rising in polls regarding the Democratic presidential nomination and in support among African American voters. He has apologised for stop-and-frisk:Trump has an extensive record of racially charged remarks and behaviour:Trump’s tweet also revisits abuse of the former mayor regarding both his physical and political stature. Responding to such an attack earlier this month, Bloomberg said he stood “twice as tall as he does on the stage that matters” and added: “This is what happens when someone like me rises in the polls. All of a sudden the other candidates get scared and I think Donald Trump knows that I can beat him.”While much of the focus in New Hampshire has been the growing tension between the field’s two leading candidates – Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg – and the falling fortunes of the national frontrunner Joe Biden, the state is also critically important for Elizabeth Warren.New Hampshire, which neighbors Massachusetts, was once a must-win for the senator. But now she is scrambling for third place with Biden and Amy Klobuchar. Recent polling has showed her falling behind Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar in the final days before the primary here.Her path forward is equally tricky, with polling placing her somewhere in the middle in the next two states: Nevada and South Carolina. Warren has told reporters in recent days that she has an organization built to go the distance. She has staff in 30 states and has already made visits to many of the Super Tuesday states all while insisting that she doesn’t need to make any consequential changes to her campaign. But the question remains: how far she can go without actually winning?Today’s New Hampshire primary is the first test of a controversial new law that requires anyone who votes with an out-of-state license, and intends to drive, to get a New Hampshire license within 60 days. Voting groups say this is a poll tax on college students, Sam Levine writes:Maggie Flaherty grew up in a small town in California, but after she moved to New Hampshire to attend Dartmouth College, she registered to vote in the state where she would be spending at least four years.Now she is embroiled in a fight against Republicans in the state that is being watched across the country.Flaherty and a fellow student are challenging a Republican-backed law that is making it harder for many out-of-state students and other temporary residents to cast a ballot in a state with outsized national influence.New Hampshire is a small swing state where both local and state-wide races can be decided by razor-thin margins. Donald Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton by just 2,736 votes in 2016. The same year, Maggie Hassan, also a Democrat, defeated Kelly Ayotte for a Senate seat by just 1,017 votes. The Democratic primary in February and general election in November are expected to be closely fought.Republicans in the state have complained about college students voting before. “They are kids voting liberal, voting their feelings, with no life experience,” William O’Brien, a Republican and then the New Hampshire house speaker, said in 2011. There are nationwide efforts to restrict the surging student vote, but the party says the new law is merely intended to bring New Hampshire in line with other states.The law, which went into effect on 1 July, mandates that anyone who has registered to vote and intends to drive while living in the state must obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license and register their vehicle within 60 days of signing up.An emboldened Donald Trump celebrated his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, where he hoped his presence would rattle his Democratic opponents on the eve of the state’s first-in-the-nation primaries.While the Democratic candidates tore into the president at rallies and events across the battleground state, Trump fired up thousands of his most ardent supporters at the Monday night rally, his first since the Senate cleared him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.“Our good Republicans in the United States Senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full, complete and absolute total acquittal,” Trump thundered to a packed arena in downtown Manchester. “It wasn’t even close!”Trump tweeted ahead of the rally that he hoped to “shake up the Dems a little bit” as they face a competitive contest, in which Vermont senator Bernie Sanders leads the field in many surveys. The New Hampshire primary has always played an outsized role in the presidential nomination process, but it has taken on a heightened significance following the disastrous failureof the Iowa caucuses to produce a clear winner.Trump delighted in the debacle, playfully asking the crowd if anyone knew who had won the Democratic caucuses. “(“Nobody knows. Flip a coin!” he said.)He added later: “The Democrat party wants to run your healthcare but they can’t even run a caucus in Iowa.”As the Democratic hopefuls crisscrossed the state, Trump supporters came from across the region, braving rain and snow, to attend the rally in Manchester, a one-time manufacturing city of 110,000 people. The line to enter the arena snaked around the arena for several blocks those at the front had arrived more than 24 hours in advance.Inside the arena, concession stands sold cotton candy, popcorn and Dippin’ Dots to people in red Make America Great Again hats and pink Women for Trump T-shirts.Hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters are expected to cast their ballots in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday for the presidential candidate they would like to see take on Donald Trump in November’s election.The primary comes just over a week after the Iowa Democratic caucuses, which ended in chaos over the reporting of the results, and where no clear single victor has been officially declared.After more than a year of campaigning, hundreds of events and millions of dollars spent, recent polling has shown the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with a high single-digit lead over the rest of the field, with the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg only a few points behind.Meanwhile, after her strong performance at a televised debate on Friday, two polls have found the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar surging to third place. Klobuchar’s ascent in recent Emerson and Suffolk polls shows that the primary contest is still taking shape.More than a dozen candidates are competing in the Democratic contest, and turnout is expected to be slightly higher than in 2016. The New Hampshiresecretary of state, Bill Gardner, predicted about 292,000 Democrats would come out to vote, compared with about 287,000 Democrats four years ago.Gardner also predicted about 128,000 Republicans would participate in their party’s primary on Tuesday, down from 2016, when there was a heated presidential primary contest. Trump does not face any serious opposition in New Hampshire’s Republican primary.Most polls close at 7pm ET, though some will stay open as late as 8pm, and results are expected soon after that.Read the full piece:After the shock of the Iowa caucus debacle eight days ago, New Hampshirecould deliver a surprise of its own, with the previously unheralded Amy Klobuchar making a late surge as the state votes in Tuesday’s Democratic primary.Klobuchar has been often relegated to an afterthought in discussions about the likely presidential nominee, yet two polls on Monday showed her running third in New Hampshire – ahead of supposed top-tier candidates Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.It would represent a remarkable turnaround for Klobuchar, who came an expectedly distant fifth in Iowa. The Minnesota senator had all but vanished from public view as the media focussed on the travails of Biden, the freshness of Pete Buttigieg and the liberalism of Bernie Sanders and Warren.But Klobuchar has been a consistently strong presence in the Democratic debates and it seems her gloves-off performance in Friday night’s latest installment – when she dismissed Buttigieg as a “cool newcomer” who would rather watch cartoons than sit through Donald Trump’s impeachment g trial – has had an immediate impact on voters.“She did a great debate on Friday night, I thought that was really good,” said Jean Shiner, one of more than a thousand people who attended a Klobuchar rally in Exeter, New Hampshire, on Monday afternoon.“I’ve been undecided, I was leaning towards her, but now I’m gonna vote for her. She has as good a chance as Biden or anybody of them of standing up to Trump. “She can really stand up for herself.”Read the full piece here:It’s primary day in New Hampshire – and Senator Warren shows how it’s done:Pete Buttigieg: I also have donuts!In a tweet – which was then deleted – Donald Trump has called Michael Bloomberg a “total racist”.The tweet carried a video of the former New York mayor speaking at the Aspen Institute in 2015, about the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policing policy he pursued in his time in City Hall.In the clip, which is spreading rapidly across social media, Bloomberg says police target minority neighbourhoods “because that’s where all the crime is”.In 2015, the Aspen Times reported that Bloomberg’s representatives “asked the Aspen Institute not to distribute footage of his recent appearance in Aspen, where the three-term New York City mayor made pointed comments concerning minorities and gun control”.The video tweeted by Trump was released by a podcaster, Benjamin Dixon.At an African American church in Brooklyn in November, Bloomberg apologised for the policy: “I can’t change history,” he said. “However today, I want you to know that I realise back then I was wrong.”With a personal fortune reckoned to be around $60bn, the former mayor is now running for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in November. He is self-funding his campaign and not competing in the early Democratic primaries. Amid a blitz of TV advertising, his poll numbers have begun to improve – notably so with African American voters, a key Democratic constituency generally thought to tilt heavily for former vice-president Joe Biden.Bloomberg’s increasing prominence in the campaign has been reported to have gained Trump’s attention.Trump’s own record on matters pertaining to race is controversial to say the least, from his record as a property developer in New York to his comments during his run for the White House to his tweets and attacks in office:Donald Trump has denounced prosecutors’ recommendation of a seven- to nine-year prison sentence for his former aide Roger Stone, reports Martin Pengelly, tweeting: “Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!”In November, Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress, thereby obstructing the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and tampering with a witness in his efforts to learn about emails hacked from Democratic sources.On Monday, federal prosecutors said a seven- to nine-year sentence would “accurately reflect the seriousness of his crimes and promote respect for the law”.Trump disagreed, writing: “This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!”Read more here:Some wondered whether Donald Trump had understood the joke when he tweeted out a clip from a recent episode of Curb your Enthusiasm. In the episode, star Larry David – who plays Bernie Sanders on Saturday Night Live and not a Trump fan – wears a “Make America Great Again” hat as a “great people repellent” among his liberal Los Angeles peers. It gets him out of an unwanted lunch with Somebody Feed Phil’s Philip Rosenthal, and means he gets a counter to himself at a sushi place. The hat also gets him out of a scrape. In the clip Trump tweeted – seemingly recorded by someone holding their phone up in front of the TV – Larry almost drives into a biker, who threatens to “rip you out of that fucking car”. Larry apologises profusely, but it’s only when he puts his Maga hat on that peace is restored. “Just be more careful next time,” the biker tells him indulgently, his mood thawing instantly when he sees the cap.“TOUGH GUYS FOR TRUMP!” was the message the president took from the sequence. Perhaps Trump didn’t get the joke. But his tweet also demonstrates the president’s judo-like ability to use his opponents’ criticisms against them, and to stomp over the original meanings of pop culture references such as Game of Thrones and the Avengers in order to use them for his own ends. He presumes that all his supporters will see in the clip is a tough-looking biker who backs Trump, and, if they do, perhaps that’s a win for him.Joe Biden has disappointed some supporters who hoped he would come out swinging following his poor showing in Iowa last week. “This is a long race and I took a hit in Iowa and I’ll probably take a hit here,” he said during Friday’s debate in Manchester, New Hampshire, a comment seen by some as defeatist.Last night he also sounded somewhat equivocal when asked if his campaign could survive coming fourth in New Hampshire tonight. “Sure I could,” he told NBC. “The path is South Carolina and going into Nevada and going into Super Tuesday, and going in to states that I’m going to do very well in.”Asked whether his case that he was the most electable candidate was suffering, he said: “I’m going down to two very erse states next, and I expect to do very well there. And still nationally, I’m still leading in all polls that I’m aware of, No 1. No 2, the endorsements keep coming in.”He hit out at both Sanders and Biden, saying of the socialist senator: “When you look at what he’s proposing in terms of the budget all the things he’s put forward and how to pay for them, there’s a $25tn hole in how to pay for everything that he’s put forward,” and of the former vice-president: “If you’re out for the most years spent in the Washington establishment then of course I’m not going to be your candidate. I will be the first to admit that. But I believe what Americans are looking for right now is a different perspective, to change what’s going on in Washington before it’s too late.” Amy Klobuchar is also hoping to do well in today’s primary, after a strong debate performance on Friday. “There’s a bunch of people coming out, committing, that had been supporting other candidates,” the centrist senator from Minnesota told reporters on Sunday. “It’s all over the place. It’s really strange. I wish I had videos of it.”Michael Bloomberg may not be running in today’s New Hampshire primary, but he might end up being one of its major beneficiaries.The former New York mayor is taking a radical approach to the primaries, ignoring the first four and only entering the race on Super Tuesday. With that in mind, he has been blanketing California and other large states with advertising, spending hundreds of millions of dollars from his multibillion-dollar fortune. Bernie Sanders in particular has been outraged at this strategy, accusing the centrist former mayor of trying to “buy the presidency”. Sanders has also hit out at the Democratic National Committee for changing its rules regarding who qualifies to take part in debates – a move widely seen as paving the way for Bloomberg to take the stage for the first time. The reason Bloomberg – who is running on a platform of gun control, an expansion of Medicare health coverage, and a less radical climate crisis policy than some of his rivals – has not qualified for debates so far is because the old rules required candidates to have taken in a certain amount in donations, and the billionaire Bloomberg is funding his campaign himself. The former mayor’s defence is basically that needs must. “Someone said: ‘Are you spending too much money?’ and I said: ‘I’m spending money to get rid of Donald Trump,’” he said recently. “And the guy said: ‘Spend more.’”Not only has Biden’s strength with African Americans been seen as one of the pillars of his claim to electability so far, but Bloomberg was seen to have a major potential problem with many black voters. While he was weighing up whether to run, he apologised for the police “stop-and-frisk” tactic he pushed in New York that disproportionately targetted black and Latino people. “I was wrong, and I am sorry,” he said. The new polling figures suggest some black voters are willing to consider him despite the controversy. If Biden’s candidacy implodes, he, Pete Buttigieg and to a lesser extent Amy Klobuchar will try to make the case to centrist Democrats that they can beat Bernie Sanders and then Donald Trump.But Bloomberg has a long way to go on Super Tuesday – he is still polling in single figures in California and Texas, for example, despite all his spending. Good morning and welcome to the ’s live blog as voters in New Hampshire go to the polls in the second primary contest of the 2020 election.Results are already coming in, with three minuscule towns – Dixville Notch, Hart’s Location and Millsfield – voting, as they traditionally do, just after midnight. Those results – showing Amy Klobuchar leading the Democratic pack with a total of eight votes – may not be a good prediction of the final tally, although it’s true the centrist Minnesota senator was praised for her debate performance on Friday night. In fact the race for the top spot tonight is widely seen as being between leftwing senator Bernie Sanders and the centrist former mayor Pete Buttigieg. The latest polling averages show Sanders with a comfortable lead over his young rival, after the two essentially tied for first place amid the shambolic caucuses in Iowa last week.“For two people in the same party, Buttigieg and Bernie are polar opposites in many ways,” Monica Klein, a progressive Democratic strategist, told my colleague Daniel Strauss. “They represent the two wings of the Democratic party – which makes Buttigieg a great contrast candidate for Bernie.”Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire – which borders his home state of Vermont – by over 22 percentage points in 2016, and if he loses to Buttigieg tonight after his frustrating night in Iowa it may indicate his campaign is stalling. While Iowa traditionally holds the first caucuses in the presidential election, New Hampshire has held the first primary since 1920.\u0026nbspThe goal for presidential candidates is to win early-voting states and create name recognition and a sense of momentum, as well to pick up their first delegates, who will eventually choose the nominee in summer.Sometimes a clear favorite for the nomination emerges quickly, but the last two major Democratic primary contests, pitting Barack Obama against Hillary Clinton and then Bernie Sanders against Clinton, have lasted from the Iowa caucuses in January through to late spring.Buttigieg, meanwhile, needs a win to keep his momentum going after his unexpectedly strong showing last week – it still hasn’t been formally declared a victory by results gurus AP – and a bump in his poll ratings in New Hampshire and (slightly) nationally. From here the contest enters much tougher territory for him. Nevada on 22 February looks like a close fight between Sanders and Joe Biden, and Barack Obama’s former vice-president is still way ahead in South Carolina. Biden has seen his frontrunner status more or less disappear since his fourth-place finish in Iowa. Sanders is now neck and neck with him nationally, and a similarly weak showing in New Hampshire tonight may see him lose further centrist support to Buttigieg and ex-New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the dark horse who joins the race on “Super Tuesday”, 3 March, when numerous states including California, Texas and Massachusetts all vote. Adam Gabbatt examines Biden’s New Hampshire campaign here. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren – Sanders’ main rival on the left – may also start to see her campaign slipping away if she fails to make an impact tonight.The Republicans are also holding a primary today, although there is only one serious candidate. Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, last night which aimed more to rattle his Democratic opponents than the relative small fry running against him in his own party. As Lauren Gambino reports, Trump attacked “the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax”, revelled in the Democrats’ muddled result in Iowa, and raised the prospect of his supporters influencing the Democratic result in New Hampshire by voting for the candidate they believe Trump would have the best chance of defeating. New Hampshire election laws allow independents to cast ballots for either Democrats or Republicans. “My only problem is I’m trying to figure out who is the weakest candidate,” the president said. “I think they’re all weak.”The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which each party selects its presidential nominee.\u0026nbspThe goal for presidential candidates is to amass a majority of delegates, whose job it is to choose the nominee at the party’s national convention later in the year.

In fact, it has been established for at least two decades that there is something called the 2080 rule – that a small core group of about one in five people transmit infections to far more people than the majority do.It seems so. The third British case, after the first two diagnosed in York, was a man in his 50s who contracted the coronavirus infection at a conference in Singapore. He then travelled to France where he stayed with his family in a ski chalet in the Alpine resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie. Five people who were in the chalet, including a boy of nine, have tested positive for coronavirus since the man came back to the UK on an easyJet flight and was diagnosed in Brighton. Another Briton who was on holiday in the chalet flew back to his home in Mallorca and was admitted to hospital in Palma. The chief medical officer said four more people had tested positive in England – all of whom were also on the skiing holiday in France.Among delegates to the Singapore conference was a man who flew in from Wuhan, China, who may himself have been a super-spreader. A number of others who were there and returned to other countries, in addition to the British man at the centre of the ski chalet cluster, are said to have fallen ill.There are a number of theories, but no definite answer. Some speculate that it is to do with the immune system of the super-spreader, which may not be good at suppressing the virus or alternatively may be so good that they do not feel symptoms themselves so carry on transmitting it to others. But it is likely to be caused by multiple factors, possibly including getting a higher dose of the virus in the first place or being infected with more than one pathogen. One thing seems certain – it is impossible to know who will be a super-spreader and who will not.Yes. Super-spreaders have been documented as far back as the early 1900s, when one woman infected 51 people with typhoid, even though she had no symptoms herself. More recently, one student at a high school in Finland infected 22 others with measles in 1998, even though eight of them had been vaccinated. Two people are thought to have infected 50 others with Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1995. In the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, most people were not very infectious, but a few super-spreaders in Singapore appear to have transmitted the virus to as many as 10 people each.The government says the measures, including powers to detain people in quarantine or in isolation, are in line with other countries and the risk to the UK remains “moderate”. But the cluster of cases emerging from the Singapore hotel followed by the French ski chalet and arriving in the UK will reinforce the ease with which any virus can travel the world via super-spreaders. There will be particular concern that people can be infected without any symptoms that would alert them or other people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125a1957a172170e7f475a83c4412c274e4512af/0_180_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab31d9a569470d97e7c89ff3aae08183","title":"what coronavirus precautions are you taking","story":"We’d like to hear from readers how they are reacting to reports of new infections in the UKAs the number of people in the UK who got infected with the coronavirus has risen to eight and a second Brighton GP surgery has closed temporarily because of the outbreak, the risks associated with the new virus have become more concrete in Britain.A leading health epidemiologist has claimed that the coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world’s population if it cannot be controlled, and the British government has declared the virus an “imminent threat”.We would like to hear from  readers in the UK how they are responding to these warnings.

But is it a religion, a philosophy – or just a joke?In the middle of a field in South Carolina, Alethea Thompson closed her eyes and attempted to sense her way forward. Thompson, now 35, had spent years trying to find a spiritual home and had decided to try something new. This exercise was meant to teach her to “to trust in your ability to sense things and know that you’re not going to fall, you’re not going to get hurt,” she says. And was part of her training to become a Jedi.After 12 years with the Force Academy, an online community that provides educational courses on Jediism, Thompson is today a Jedi master. She explains that the Force Academy and most Jedi organisations don’t prescribe strict rituals: there are no requirements on diet or clothing and no mass-style services. Jedis do, however, follow a code of ethics that centres on resisting negative emotions and promoting peace. They also believe in the Force – the ubiquitous energy field described in the Star Wars movies – and mindfulness is central to their belief system. “The foundation of who we are is meditation,” says Thompson. “I will meditate for about 30 minutes, but it’s not always the same kind of meditation. So, I don’t sit there all the time and just hum. Meditation comes in many forms and that’s what I try to teach in the community.”To most people, Jedis are the priestly, lightsaber-wielding warriors that existed a long time ago, in a fictional galaxy far, far away. Their creator, the Star Wars writer and director George Lucas, seems to have been heavily influenced by real religions and philosophies such as Buddhism, Taoism, Kabbalah and the medieval code of chivalry. This gives verisimilitude to the Jedi religion in the films. However, the real-world religion arguably has origins in an internet prank almost 20 years ago.Yet among the hundreds of thousands of pranksters were people who truly believed they could feel the Force. Since the census, various attempts have been made to codify Jedi beliefs into a coherent religion, such as the Church of Jediism, founded by 20-year-old Daniel Jones in 2006 in Anglesey, Wales.But with its roots in a film aimed at children, Jediism is wide open for mockery. For instance, followers have to explain that they don’t worship Yoda and, in fact, spend most of their time striving for spiritual growth and self-improvement rather than trying to shoot lightning bolts from their fingertips.Today the UK Jedi community is estimated to have about 2,000 members – similar to the number of Scientologists in the country. However, their sincerity and numbers didn’t sway the Charity Commission, which in 2016 rejected an application for charitable status from the Temple of the Jedi Order, a Jedi organisation started in Beaumont, Texas.This rejection may be just as well, as many Jedis consider Jediism a philosophy rather than a religion, a spiritual operating system on which any religious programme can run. Followers say you can be a Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Christian or even an atheist Jedi.Thompson herself had a complicated journey to Jediism. Her early childhood was difficult and she was taken into foster care. After she returned to her mother’s home a year later, she was raised as a Catholic. But she became disillusioned after learning how the church regarded Mary. “It bothered me that this belief system would say you only worship one deity, but they treated Mary like a goddess,” she says. When she was 13, Thompson decided to worship the Sumerian gods Inanna and Enki. Then a close friend introduced her to the Force Academy.There was one sticking point: “I hate Star Wars!” she says. “I felt like it was a Western space opera.” She was convinced only after hearing that the Force Academy aims to make Jediism compatible with other faiths.Today, Thompson credits the spiritual practise with making her more tolerant, contemplative and empathetic. The Jedi, she says, had a “solid plan” on how she could become a “helpful force in the world”. Others say it has even saved their lives. Vishwa Jay, 45, lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is a teacher of Buddhist philosophy, as well as the founder of a Jedi school. His early life was chaotic he was taken into care aged seven and, before turning 18, had lived in five children’s homes and had more than 70 foster placements. This unrelenting displacement meant Jay emerged as an angry young man without meaningful relationships. His anger got him into fights, but he says even this was because he was trying to connect with people. “I got into underground fighting. Suddenly, I had friends for the first time and I didn’t know how to handle it.” Jay was put off the bare-knuckle scene only after an opponent attacked him with an aluminium baseball bat.In his early 20s, Jay got in trouble with the police. He ended up going to see a Hindu swami called Mrs Stone. “I tend to try and be fairly rational about things. I was having a hard time accepting the reality of anything that she was trying to teach me on a spiritual level,” Jay explains. Stone asked him what he held sacred. “Being the rather smart ass that I was, I said Star Wars. She said: ‘Star Wars, hmm, that’s a great place to start.’ Immediately, at that moment, I knew I was doomed,” he says.Jay began by studying the philosophy in the films and meditating. “One of the things that I learned from the Jedi philosophy was that being emotionally stable means facing the darkness within you. One of the foster homes I was living in had farms. And one of the things they do is take cow manure. After a while, it turns into fertiliser. So, the way that I explain it is you have to work through all of your bullshit in order to get something to grow.”Jay, now a father of five, is no longer an angry young man using fists to make friends. He says much of his new happiness is down to Mrs Stone. “I’m pretty sure that I would have ended up in the grave by now because I had no knowledge of myself. I had no real concern about anyone other than myself.”Jay promised his partner, who is not a Jedi, that he would not steer his children to Jediism, although his eldest daughter has found it herself. “She decided that, since it worked for me, it will probably work for her. In the last year she’s started learning a bit about the philosophy.” Does his Jedi Zen help, looking after five kids? “It does. Most people would be completely off their nog just trying to keep up.”Jay Tepley, 38, is a meditation teacher based in London. Before she had even watched the films, people called her a Jedi. “Because of mind mastery. I teach people to make their minds stronger and repel other people’s mental influence. I teach people to become better, stronger versions of themselves,” she says.Is she a real Jedi? “Well, it depends what you mean. I’m not a Jedi in this world’s understanding in terms of people being fans of the films and just dressing up in some peculiar way. I’m more of an actual Jedi from the film. If it were possible for them to travel here, they would recognise me as one of them.” This is not to say she doesn’t wear robes and, as well as teaching meditation, she teaches fencing at her lightsaber club. “Fencing is a great way of training your muscles, your focus and your sense of balance at the same time,” Tepley says.A true Jedi is never without their lightsaber. After all, in Attack of the Clones, Obi Wan Kenobi tells Anakin Skywalker: “This weapon is your life.” Everett Ratcliffe, who goes by the Jedi name Arisaig Winterthorn, concurs. “I use a lightsaber because it’s really, really fun to use and it gets me out there every single day.” Ratcliffe, 26, is from Canada, but lives in Loughborough, Leicestershire. He discovered Jediism after leaving the Canadian army. “When I came to the Jedi path, I was using a cane to walk from an injury acquired in training during my time in the forces. I was fat, I hated myself and my mind was slipping as my life lacked direction. Now, I’m healthy,” Ratcliffe says. After recovering from his injury, Ratcliffe began practising lightsaber flow, a fencing form that entails spinning a sword or staff in intricate spirals. “It’s really intensive on the body and there’s just so much to learn to keep getting better at it.”In the Star Wars films, the Force is the supernatural energy that allows Jedis to levitate objects, confuse Stormtroopers and attack people from a distance. Among followers of Jediism, the Force is interpreted in many ways, but most consider it a metaphor rather than something that helps them choke people like Darth Vader. For Ratcliffe, it is an omnipresent energy field. “I gave myself to the Force and the Force gave me everything,” he says. Can you feel this Force? “Of course. Anyone can. Every time you drink a glass of water you’re feeling the Force. Anything that can be experienced is an experience in the Force.”But he says: “You ask 10 Jedi, you’ll get 10 different answers.” He is not wrong: for Tepley, the Force is the energy that underlines our entire existence Thompson thinks it accounts for miracles Jay believes it might have been responsible for the big bang. Richard Sroka, a programme analyst from Portland, Oregon, says the Force feels like a wellspring. “It feels like being a lot more alive, a lot more energetic,” he says. “You’re not worrying about tomorrow, you’re not worrying about yesterday. You’re living precisely when you are.”Like Jay, Sroka struggled with anger, and the nostalgia he had for the films drew him to Jediism. “It’s the first thing that clicked,” he says. After immersing himself in Jedi philosophy, Sroka felt better able to control his temper. “When I start to feel angry, I take a step back, view where it’s coming from, identify what’s causing it and find the solutions to it. That’s where a lot of my connection to Jediism begins. It also taught me that sometimes you’ve got to disengage you’re not always going to be able to get through the situation.”Should we be mocking this belief system that sprung from our local multiplexes? Speaking to Jedi followers, it becomes clear that the lessons Jediism teaches are things that can be learned at Sunday school: help others, help yourself, embrace the light and resist the dark. In other words, be righteous and resist temptation. Sroka is philosophical about the fact most people won’t take it seriously. “It came from a movie and people don’t quite get it and that’s fine,” he says. Yet, he points out, that doesn’t mean it cannot help people. “When I go to work out, I have the mental image of Kratos from God of War,” he says referring to a popular video game. “Am I going to be able to hold two axes and do all those crazy stunts? Am I going to have those giant muscles? No. Am I going to have a great beard? Probably not, but if that’s what gets me up and moving then why is that a bad thing?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd47aab20a01be4cdd5cacb0302350df8de3c361/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bed6bd9363dde58a1f3cbbc7d20687c9","title":"how novel coronavirus spread across the world visual explainer","story":"Confirmed cases of flu-like virus  29 countries, with about 1,000 deaths mostly in mainland ChinaThe coronavirus epidemic began in Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people and the capital of the Hubei province in China.

Other passengers were crying as the plane jumped and shook.Storm Ciara was playing with our plane.I had been booked on the 8.55am Aer Lingus flight on Sunday, from Dublin to London Gatwick. As I sat at the gate I received a text saying my flight was cancelled, so was delighted when staff moved me onto a 10.50am flight. Others around me faced a wait until 5pm.That joy soon evaporated. We boarded at 10.30am. The woman beside me was visiting her pregnant daughter and joked they would have to call the baby Ciara.As the plane wobbled alarmingly in the strong winds on the ground, the captain said we could not leave for an hour.It looked wild outside, but I saw other planes taking off and was not too worried.When we finally took off the plane shuddered and shook, sending my adrenaline soaring and prompting expressions of concern among other passengers.An hour later, when we descended towards Gatwick, the plane jumped and shook.We swooped down and back up violently while attempting to land four times.People were shouting and breathing deeply into their sick bags. I gripped the armrests as tightly as I could, terrified. Others were getting sick – or crying.After repeated attempts to land, lasting around one hour, the plane climbed above the clouds.The captain said because we were unable to land safely at Gatwick we needed to go to Luxembourg to refuel.We’d been in the sky for almost three hours.There was a rush to the toilets despite the seatbelt signs being on, and many people ran up the aisles cupping full sick bags. The air stewards – upbeat, kind and calm – asked passengers to remain seated.That wasn’t going to happen . . .The captain then said Luxembourg airport was full and that we had to fly to Frankfurt.Everyone laughed initially at the catalogue of mishaps, but the mood quickly changed to concern that we could run out of fuel, especially if there were problems during landing.Eventually we landed at 3pm in Frankfurt Hahn, and people started phoning relatives to say we had arrived very late, somewhere very far away from Gatwick after a four-hour flight.Some tried to recount the events of the flights others sought to downplay what happened.We remained on the plane.The stewards tried to serve refreshments, but the aisles were full of restless, hungry people, exhausted from adrenaline and seeking answers.Some people refused to stay on the plane and insisted on getting off even though they would have to find and fund their way back.There are no direct Dublin flights from Frankfurt Hahn.Eventually we were told “the powers that be” wanted the plane back in Dublin, and that Gatwick was accepting very few flights.Despite the frustration, the camaraderie among passengers was great: one man joked his daughter was delighted she would miss school the next day.Someone handed out bags from a souvenir multi-pack of Tayto. We giggled from nerves.At 5.30pm, the captain confirmed we were returning to Dublin and the tirelessly helpful stewards prepared for takeoff for the two-hour flight.As we descended into Dublin, dipping lower and lower, the plane suddenly whooshed up again and people started laughing and screaming. Were we ever going to be on the ground again?The captain said it was too windy to land on this approach so we were going to try again.My neighbours had their head in hands as I reassured them we were wobbling closer and closer to the ground.Finally we landed, at 8.30pm.

Photograph: Tom Honan More than 6,000 photographs of the Yes Equality campaign have been added to the National Library of Ireland’s digital archive, almost five years after the referendum that cleared the way for same-sex marriages to take place.The visual record of the campaign is part of the library’s “Digital Pilots” project, which seeks to expand the way it collects and provides access to stories and enables content like videos and digital documents to be added to its collection.The pilot scheme aims to ensure that information and memories of Ireland’s modern history are not lost. The archive documents various aspects of the campaign, including personal stories of those involved and their families, images from polling day and the celebrations after the result.The referendum, held on May 22nd, 2015, saw Ireland become the first country to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote. Some 62 per cent of voters approved the amendment on a turnout of 61 per cent.The contents of the Yes Equality archive will be available to view in person in the National Library. It will also be made available online, meaning users can view the collection from anywhere in the world.Speaking at the announcement, Dr Sandra Collins, director of the National Library, said the 2015 referendum was an important part of Ireland’s contemporary history.Milestones“Ireland has undergone huge changes over the last number of years and it’s really important that we add the memory, those milestones, into the national collections,” she said. “We’ll have them safe here, permanently, for everybody to use, research and enjoy for all the decades to come.”Gráinne Healy, one of the leaders of the Yes Equality campaign, said it was important to ensure people remember when Ireland began to move away from its more conservative origins.“What happened in 2015, there was great joy and celebration, but time passes on and people actually forget. They forget what it looked like, what was the mood and I think the photographic collection really captures the campaign, that we had such involvement and engagement by all of the citizens around the country,” she said.Ms Healy added that she hopes the archive will enable future generations to study the referendum and its political consequences.The Yes Equality campaign is the second digital archive donated to the National Library. Author Marian Keyes provided the first.In the coming months, there will be a third archive created as part of the digital pilots programme, the details of which have not yet been announced."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4170380.1581430676!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 eight things we learned from the campaign and the results","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMicheál Martin of Fianna Fáil after being elected to the 33rd Dáil for the Cork South-Central constituency. Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesLeo Varadkar’s offer of a grand coalition to Fianna Fáil near the start of the campaign further emphasised the point to many voters. One consequence was that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil candidates couldn’t buy a transfer in the latter stages of many counts – except from each other.Before the election, another confidence-and-supply agreement was widely considered to be one of the options for government that would be on the table when it came to government formation. Any of the big parties would think twice about doing it now.2 Shift to the leftThe old firm of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael won only 43 per cent of the vote between them. Even if you add in some “gene pool” independents from both camps, it’s clear that the country has moved significantly to the left. That was also visible in the way Sinn Féin transfers – and there were an awful lot of them – tended to stay with parties of the left in many counts.However, the left of Irish politics is indeed a wide and varied spectrum, ranging from the revolutionary left of Solidarity-People Before Profit, who favour an overthrow of the existing capitalist system, mass nationalisation of business and a huge expansion of the State, with the rather more moderate centre-left of the Labour Party and the Social Democrats – and all points in between.The biggest beneficiaries, Sinn Féin, published a heavily redistributionist manifesto proposing an increase on taxes on business and the wealthy to pay for expanded public services, but also pledges to maintain the enterprise economy and the multi-national sector.3 The future matters more than the pastFor decades, Sinn Féin’s support for the IRA’s campaign of violence shut the party off from the vast majority southern voters. The IRA’s campaign ended in the 1990s however and despite ongoing questions about paramilitary links and control of the party, it is clear that the party’s history is no longer a barrier for many voters, especially younger people. The party’s message of social transformation is more important to them.A strong antipathy to Sinn Féin remains however among many older voters, and among those who voted for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, there is a strong opposition to having Sinn Féin in government with anyone.4 Voters don’t do gratitudeThe economic recovery under Fine Gael, from a point of near-bankruptcy and mass unemployment in 2011, has been spectacular by any standards. But many voters either don’t care about it, or disagree with the manner in which it was achieved. Either way, Fine Gael’s economic arguments fell on deaf ears. Politics is usually future-focussed.By contrast, several TDs who opposed the change in the constitution were re-elected, including Peadar Tóibín, the Meath TD who was drummed out of Sinn Féin for his views and went on to found Aontú.Perhaps the one-third of voters who opposed the change didn’t forget. Or maybe voters just don’t think abortion is that important in a general election.5 Campaigns matterWhile the choices of many voters are already set before the campaign begins, the days when the parties could rely on the rock-solid loyalty of most of the electorate are gone.It used to be the case that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour campaigners looked at streets and knew that they had several reliable votes in several houses. That time is gone.The exit poll suggests that almost half of voters had their minds made up before the campaign began. The other half made up their minds during the campaign, and at least half of them did so during the last few days. Sinn Féin won votes during the three-week campaign Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael lost them.6 Polls workThe exit poll was within the margin of error on almost everything with the exception of the Sinn Féin vote, which it underestimated by just over two per cent the emergence, perhaps, of shy Sinn Féin voters.But the final Ipsos MRBI poll of the campaign was almost exactly right – it had Sinn Féin on 25 per cent, Fianna Fáil on 23 per cent, Fine Gael on 20 per cent, Labour on 4 per cent and the Greens on 8 per cent. At the election all the parties won a share of the vote that was within a single percentage point of these numbers.8 Independents have an enduring strength in Irish politicsOne of the most distinctive features of the Irish political system when viewed from outside is the prevalence of independent TDs. That trend has continued, with 20 independents elected to the new Dáil, from all points on the political spectrum. In the case of the outgoing government, their role moved from supporting an administration from the backbenches to actively participating in the government in Cabinet and minister of State jobs.While the electoral consequences for the independents who were part of Leo Varadkar’s government when the election was called were disastrous – only one out of six has returned to the Dáil – that may not diminish the expectations of any independent TD whose support is solicited for a new government. In politics everyone believes that this time, it’ll be different.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WirePolitical parties of all hues are holding talks in an attempt to find a path towards forming a new government.The Green Party met just after 11.30 this morning in what was the first gathering of its 12 new TDs. It is understood the party was discussing its red lines for any coalition and plans for future negotiations.The Soc Dems are also expected to meet as the focus turns to the shape of a new coalition.The Labour Party will meet to discuss its options on Wednesday but a source said the party is unlikely to enter any government with Sinn Féin specifically with further doubts around whether it would enter any government at all.Peadar Tóibín, Aontú leader and Meath West TD, has also said that he has contacted around five independents in a bid to find a “common platform” to negotiate a place in a coalition.Fianna Fáil have secured 38 seats, just one ahead of Sinn Féin on 37 and three ahead of Fine Gael on 35.ReconveneThe Green Party have increased their seats from three to 12 and the Social Democrats have tripled their seat count from two to six.Solidarity People Before Profit have five seats – partially thanks to sizeable transfers from Sinn Féin – while the Labour Party is returning to the next Dáil with six. Aontú has retained its one seat and there are 19 Independents.The Dáil is scheduled to reconvene on Thursday, February 20th, but before then talks to form a government will intensify.The prospect of a Sinn Féin-led leftist government looks uncertain despite claims from Mary Lou McDonald that she could yet be Taoiseach.A majority of 80 is needed to form a Government.Left-wing TD Richard Boyd Barrett has played down the prospect of a Sinn Féin-led leftist government.The Dun Laoghaire TD, whose Solidarity-People Before Profit alliance won five seats in the general election, said he doesn’t believe the numbers are there for an alternative coalition of progressive parties.“If you look at the numbers… it appears we don’t quite have the numbers,” he told Newstalk.“We will explore what we can do in that regard, but looking at the raw numbers, it would seem we are short of a majority to be able to do that.”Mr Boyd Barrett said he believed there would be discussions between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil about a possible coalition and also Fianna Fail, Sinn Féin and the Greens. Mary Lou McDonald has said her first preference would be to form a coalition involving neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael.The Sinn Féin leader indicated she hold talks with Solidarity-People Before Profit, the Greens, the Social Democrats and Labour as well as Independents.Former Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern suggested there was a possibility of Sinn Féin forming a left coalition, with like-minded Independents.“I can’t see that being a success, but it could be,” he said.“There is a sizeable number of rural Independents, probably a group of at least 10 who are like-minded enough, who got strong votes.”Mr Ahern told Newstalk that over the last 30 years “new things come up” out of “Dáil and election chaos”.On the possibility of a Fianna FáilSinn Féin coalition, Mr Ahern said he didn’t think there would be a “a sizeable number of Fianna Fáil people” who would have an appetite for it.Rotating taoiseachOn the suggestion of a rotating taoiseach as part of a coalition arrangement, he added that he couldn’t think of any country where such an arrangement was in place.“It would be very hard to see how it would work,” he added.Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy said the “numbers are going to be tight” in its efforts to forge an administration without the two former largest parties but said “we have an obligation” to talk to the left-wing parties first over the coming days.“My preference is that (a government) is formed as quickly as possible but my more pressing wish is that the government, when in place, is robust and has a strong mandate and more importantly it implements the kind of changes people voted for last Saturday,” he said.Peadar Tóibín, Aontu leader and Meath West TD, said he has “reached out” to about five Independents who he is planning to talk to over the coming days about a “common platform” to negotiate a place in a coalition.“Basically what we are looking at doing is to see if we can build a common platform of objectives which would be core to any future government and then potentially negotiate to have those objectives included in a programme for government,” he told RTÉ Radio One.Mr Tóibín said he wouldn’t be confining his would-be alliance to the five.Fine Gael’s outgoing Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said the “onus is on Mary Lou” to try and form a government.Ms McDonald has made preliminary contact with the leaders of the smaller parties as a prelude to negotiations on putting together what would be an extraordinarily erse administration.NegotiationsBut she also said that “of course” she intended to talk to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about the possibility of government formation. Both parties had ruled out working with Sinn Féin after the election.She said that the question of a rotating taoiseach would be “part and parcel” of any negotiations with the other big parties.Fianna Fáil is deeply ided over whether it should seek a coalition with Fine Gael or with Sinn Féin.A view has taken hold among party TDs that it should enter opposition and allow Sinn Féin to attempt to form a minority government.Multiple TDs have said over the last 24 hours that the onus is on Sinn Féin to find a path to Government.Senior Fine Gael sources reiterated the view that they would not consider entering government with Sinn Féin, with some senior figures favouring a spell in opposition for the party after nine years in government.Some party sources said a coalition with Fianna Fáil could come on to the agenda after some weeks if no other government was formed.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Khaled DesoukiAFP via Getty ImagesSudan’s government and rebel groups in Darfur agreed on Tuesday that all those wanted by the International Criminal Court should appear before the tribunal, a list that includes ousted president Omar al-Bashir.Mr Bashir, who has been jailed in Khartoum since he was toppled after mass protests last year, is wanted by the ICC for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.Information minister Faisal Saleh did not specifically name him when announcing the move, but said the decision applied to all five Sudanese suspects wanted by the ICC over Darfur. Mr Bashir is one of the five suspects.The government and the rebel groups reached an agreement during a meeting in South Sudan’s capital, Juba, that included “the appearance of those who face arrest warrants before the International Criminal Court”, said Mohamed al-Hassan al-Taishi, a member of Sudan’s sovereign council.Mr Taishi also said that the two sides agreed to create a Darfur special court to investigate and hear cases including those investigated by the ICC.That court would try Darfur suspects not indicted by the ICC, said Nimri Mohamed Abd, chief negotiator of the Darfur people in Juba. He said Darfur groups and Sudan’s government had agreed to “fully co-operate with the International Criminal Court”, and that the timing of the handover would be decided in final negotiations.Mr Bashir’s lawyer said the ex-president refused to have any dealings with the ICC because it was a “political court”.Mr Bashir has said the allegations made by the ICC, the world’s first permanent court for prosecuting war crimes, are part of a Western conspiracy.A spokesman for the ICC declined to comment. The Hague-based court issued its first arrest warrant for Mr Bashir in 2009 – its first for a sitting head of state – and a year later issued a second one.ChargesMr Bashir faces five counts of crimes against humanity for murder, forcible transfer, extermination, torture and rape two counts of war crimes for attacks against civilians and three counts of genocide for killings and creating conditions meant to bring about the destruction of the targeted group, allegedly committed between 2003 and 2008 in Darfur.Sudan’s civilian government, which is running the country under a three-year transition with the military, has been seeking to make peace with rebels in Darfur and other neglected regions that had been fighting Mr Bashir’s government for years.Darfur rebels and residents have long demanded that Mr Bashir should be tried. Conflict spread in the impoverished western region in 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against Khartoum. Government forces and mainly Arab militia mobilised to suppress the revolt were accused of widespread atrocities and genocide.In Khartoum, where protesters gathered outside the prime minister’s office to call for a faster transition, opinion was split on whether Mr Bashir should be sent to The Hague.But another protester, Mowafeq Othman, said handing Mr Bashir over would undermine Sudan’s courts. “Don’t hand him over, this would mean Sudan’s judiciary is weak – so long as he is a Sudanese citizen, regardless of anything else, he should be tried here,” he said.A Sudanese court handed Mr Bashir a first, two-year sentence in December on corruption charges. He also faces trials or investigations over the killing of protesters and his role in the 1989 coup that brought him to power. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4170297.1581422561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"von der leyen surprised at uk suggestion of australia style eu relationship","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Strasbourg on Tuesday. Photograph: Jean-Francois BadiasAPBoris Johnson’s suggestion that the UK could be prepared to accept an Australian-style relationship with the EU without a formal trade deal has “surprised” Brussels. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen pointed out that even Australia wants a better trading relationship with the bloc than the one it currently has.She said the UK and EU should be “way more ambitious” about reaching a full trade deal.In a speech setting out the UK’s negotiating objectives, the British prime minister said the question was whether to seek a Canadian-style deal or an Australian-style relationship, “and I have no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper”.But speaking in the European Parliament, Ms von der Leyen said both models fell short of a deal which would meet the goals of allowing trade without tariffs and quotas.That aim, set out in the political declaration, would require a “level playing field” with both sides guaranteeing “fair competition and the protection of social, environmental and consumer standards”.“We are ready to discuss all different models of trade agreement. But all these models, whatever you choose, have one thing in common — they all come not only with rights but also with obligations for both sides.”The Canada deal eliminates most, but not all, tariffs and quotas and “we still have our standards that have to be respected”, she said.Ms von der Leyen added: “Honestly, I was a little bit surprised to hear the prime minister of the United Kingdom speak about the Australian model.“Australia, without any doubt, is a strong and a like-minded partner. But the European Union does not have a trade agreement with Australia.“We are currently trading on WTO terms and, if this is the British choice, well, we are fine with that, without any question.”But the EU was trying to negotiate a trade deal with Australia to end the current situation.“Of course the UK can decide to settle for less, but I personally believe that we should be way more ambitious,” she said.Javid plansMs von der Leyen’s speech in Strasbourg came as the UK government set out further details of its plans for January 1st, 2021 after the Brexit transition period expires.Chancellor Sajid Javid said the government will aim to conclude a full range of equivalence assessments by June 2020 – allowing the UK and EU to respect each other’s rules.But he said the UK would also have the freedom to erge and regulate in a different way from the rules set in Brussels.Writing in City AM, he said: “Each side will only grant equivalence if it believes the other’s regulations are compatible.“But compatible does not mean identical, and both the UK and the EU have at different times recognised the importance of focusing on regulatory outcomes.“We will no longer be rule-takers, but we remain committed to the highest international standards of financial regulation and to shaping global rule-making.”But Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: “I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear to certain people in the United Kingdom bearing authority that they should not kid themselves about this – there will not be general, open-ended, ongoing equivalence in financial services.”The EU would “retain a free hand to take our own decisions”.Senior cabinet minister Michael Gove confirmed on Monday that goods coming to Britain from the EU will face import controls from January 1st.The British Retail Consortium said the government would have to move fast to get infrastructure in place for the start of 2021, warning that without adequate preparations the availability of goods on shelves would be disrupted, with fresh fruit and vegetables especially vulnerable.Mr Barnier told MEPs it would not be “business as usual” after January 1st.“Come what may, on January 1st we will be imposing checks on all products entering the single market, just as we do to every other third country in the world,” he said. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4168469.1581361528!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland scotland bridge being considered by british officials","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson attends an awards ceremony held at the Banqueting House, London. Photograph: David ParryPA WireBritish government ministers are actively looking into Boris Johnson’s idea of a road bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland, Downing Street has said, rejecting scepticism on the issue from engineers and criticism of the prime minister’s own somewhat mixed record on delivering bridges.“Government officials are carrying out work in relation to the idea of a bridge linking the GB mainland to Northern Ireland,” Mr Johnson’s spokesman said, saying this was being done by “a range” of officials reporting into Number 10.“There is a proper piece of work being carried out into the idea,” the spokesman said. “It is reporting into Number 10, but obviously we will take advice from wherever it is needed.” He gave no details on when the work would be completed.Mr Johnson, who as London mayor spearheaded the doomed garden bridge project which cost more than £50 million (about €60 million) without work even beginning, first raised the idea of the 32km-plus bridge to Larne in Northern Ireland in 2018.He called again for the link during the Conservative leadership campaign, despite engineers expressing scepticism at the idea of building such a link over waters more than 300m deep in places, parts of which were used by the British ministry of defence to dump more than 1 million tonnes of obsolete munitions.The plan has been seen as a concession to Northern Irish unionists, especially given their concern at new customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK under Mr Johnson’s Brexit plan.Asked about the bridge by the DUP MP Ian Paisley in the House of Commons in December, Mr Johnson called it “a very interesting idea”, adding: “I advise him to watch this space and, indeed, to watch the space between the islands, because what he has said has not fallen on deaf ears.”Long-standing enthusiasmMr Johnson has long been an enthusiast for major infrastructure projects, but his visions only sometimes become reality, and those which do have had a tendency to not fully deliver on his promises.As London mayor, Mr Johnson pushed repeatedly for the garden bridge across the Thames, despite repeated warnings about its economic unfeasibility and the complication of securing planning consents, wasting £53.5 million of funds, £43 million of it taxpayers’ money.An even more ambitious idea for a new London airport in the Thames estuary came to nothing. As mayor, Mr Johnson did deliver a £60 million cable car across the Thames in east London, but a supposed key transport link later turned out to have just four regular users.More expensive still was Mr Johnson’s plan for a “new Routemaster” bus for the city, allowing passengers to hop on and off open platforms.Transport for London paid more than £280 million for a fleet of the buses which turned out to be baking hot in the summer, with the doors kept closed for safety reasons, and were unable to be sold to any other cities. Last month it was announced that the buses’ rear doors would be kept closed due to rampant fare evasion.Mr Johnson’s spokesman rejected criticism of this record: “The prime minister is ambitious in terms of infrastructure projects. He’s looking at a wide range of schemes across the UK which could boost connectivity.” – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Back then, the risk was all thought to be on Mrs Merkel’s part.It is a measure of how far Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer, or AKK as she likes to be known, has fallen from grace that her announcement on Monday that she would not lead her party into next year’s election had an air of inevitability about it.Back in 2018, she used to be known as mini-Merkel. But the nickname has disappeared as the expectation she could live up to her mentor\u0027s example has faded.In just over a year as Christian Democrat (CDU) leader she has lurched from gaffe to gaffe and the party has continued its inexorable slide in the polls.But it was last week’s debacle in Thuringia, when CDU politicians defied her and broke the party’s traditional “firewall” against the far-Right to vote alongside the nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD), that finished Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer.She claimed on Monday she was stepping down because some in the CDU were not prepared to delineate the party strongly enough against the AfD and the Left party.But the truth, harsh though it may sound, is that she just wasn’t up to the job. That was clear last week as she foundered for a response to the Thuringian crisis and Mrs Merkel had to step in.Where Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer had vacillated and negotiated with the rebel politicians, Mrs Merkel ended the crisis with a simple statement, announcing that what they had done was “unforgivable” and must be reversed. It was a brutal demonstration of the difference between the two women, and a death blow to Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer’s personal authority.For an idea of how seriously the “firewall” against any cooperation with the AfD is taken in German politics, consider only that last week’s events were openly compared to the rise of the Nazi party.But if Thuringia ended AKK’s hopes of succeeding Mrs Merkel, her bid started to unravel long before. It began within months after she secured the CDU leadership at the end of 2018.There was her disastrous attempt to woo the party’s conservative wing with an off-colour joke about third gender toilets being for men “who aren\u0027t sure whether they can still pee standing up”.When she was called out on that, she doubled down by accusing Germans of being “the most uptight people in the world” — not a good line for some one trying to become chancellor of Germany.But AKK’s biggest mistake in her first months as leader was probably allowing the impression she was on manoeuvres to ease Mrs Merkel out of power early so she could take her place.Mrs Merkel had engineered AKK’s rise within the party specifically to prolong her own time as chancellor. Whatever the truth of what AKK was up to in those early months, by letting reports she wanted Mrs Merkel gone go unchallenged, she appears to have alienated her most important ally.When the CDU performed badly in last year’s European elections, Mrs Merkel repaid her in kind, allowing the word to go around that she had “lost faith” in her former protege.And last September, in a particularly cutting display of power, Mrs Merkel refused to allow AKK and her entourage to share her ministerial flight to the US for the UN climate summit.Without Mrs Merkel’s protection, AKK quickly began to founder. She had an almost uncanny ability for gaffes in the immediate run-up to elections.Just before the European elections she fumbled the CDU’s response to an attack from a prominent Youtube star, allowing it to go unanswered for days.And in the run-up to regional elections in eastern Germany last year she picked a fight with one of the party’s most popular figures in the region.Then there was the confusion over her ministerial role. When she became CDU leader she made great play of the fact she wasn’t taking a cabinet job so she could concentrate on rebuilding the party’s electoral fortunes.But in a U-turn last summer she took on the defence ministry, widely seen as one of the toughest roles in German government. She tried to spin it as a chance to prove herself in high office. But it was no secret in Berlin that she took the job in order to block Jens Spahn, one of her closest rivals, from taking it and using it as a launchpad to challenge her.For a woman already struggling with the party leadership, it was a ludicrous extra burden.Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer will not depart immediately. She said on Monday she would stay on as party leader over the summer while the CDU elects a chancellor candidate to lead it into next year’s election.That race looks set to reopen isions between the Merkellian, moderate wing and the conservatives, and the debate over the party’s future direction.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis irish voters take sinn fein mainstream united ireland","story":"The prospect of the nationalist Sinn Fein entering government in Ireland now looks to be very real following last weekend’s election, a move that will make many British voters that recall the Troubles instinctively deeply uncomfortable.But in a world of fragmenting politics that had already ended the longtime duopoly of Ireland’s two mainstream governing parties - Fine Gael and Fianna Fail - it was perhaps only a matter of time before Sinn Fein found a route to power.Still, it seems that no-one - least of all Sinn Fein itself, which didn’t stand in many constituencies - foresaw this happening so quickly, given that the party had polled around 11 per cent in recent European and Presidential elections.But by winning the second-largest number of seats in the Dáil, there is now a very real prospect that a British foreign minister will find themselves sitting across the table from a Sinn Fein Tanaiste whose party is avowedly in favour of reuniting Ireland.This at a time when the British prime minister talks about \u0027cementing the union\u0027 with a £15 billion \u0027Boris bridge\u0027 between Ireland and Scotland - as Northern Ireland’s Unionists complain bitterly that Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal is inexorably sucking the province into Dublin’s economic orbit.If Brexit was not already testing the viability of the deliberate constitutional limbo that underpinned the Good Friday Agreement, then the prospect of Sinn Fein in government surely does so.This does not mean that a ‘border poll’ is anywhere close to being an immediate prospect, since a vote on Irish unity can only be triggered by the British secretary of state “if at any time it appears likely to him” that a majority in Northern Ireland would vote for unification.The best available data, from the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey which has been surveying opinion since the 1998 peace deal was signed, still only shows around a quarter of Northern Ireland’s population are explicitly pro-unification.Forthcoming election data is expected to show a potential narrow majority among Catholics for Irish Unity, but taking into account the entire population of Northern Ireland, the secretary of state currently has no grounds to call a poll.That is not to diminish the seismic nature of last weekend’s result, and the potential it provides both to change the dynamic between London and Dublin, but also within the Republic of Ireland itself.Although Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald clearly won voters over on an anti-austerity ticket, the price of any coalition will be to formalise the unification agenda through a government White Paper that will give official form and content to the idea.If that is the case, then what is now a talking point down the pub or at the bus stop can be given an official, bureaucratic structure and legitimacy that, incrementally, can lay the foundations for the longer term ambitions for unification.We live in constitutionally febrile times. No one can be sure precisely how the Irish ‘frontstop’, with its capacity to hit both business and consumers in the North, will impact the discussion on unification - nor indeed the impact of a Scottish vote for secession.The prospect of Sinn Fein entering government in Dublin is another destabilising ingredient in that volatile constitutional mix.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trapped board coronavirus cruise ship would happen just ran","story":"There are times as the hours drag past when I wonder what would happen if I just ran out of the isolation of my claustrophobic cabin and made a break for it down the corridor screaming “get me off this ship!”   I expect that the black-clad hall monitors, who keep a vigilant eye on our doors over their protective face masks, would immediately jump into action and sedate me before dragging me into quarantine somewhere else.The passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been in lockdown in Yokohama port since last week, feel like we’re being viewed as lethal weapons – if we are contaminated with the coronavirus, we could infect the local population.It’s like being caught up in the plot of a bad science fiction movie, and a far cry from what I expected last year when I excitedly booked a Lunar New Year cruise in Asia, on the other side of the world from my home in Paso Robles, in the rolling hills of California’s wine country.Everyone told me that Hong Kong was known for its amazing New Year fireworks. I was disappointed when they were cancelled after months of political unrest in the city, but none of us had any idea that a much bigger problem was about to hit our ship.I did not even get off the boat because at that time, we were already hearing about the coronavirus. But we picked up new passengers from Hong Kong, and we heard that one of them, who has since disembarked, tested positive for the virus.We realised how serious this was when Japanese quarantine officials came on board on Sunday February 2 to check the temperatures of all 3,700 passengers and they worked through the night. They started at 11pm and only reached my cabin at 8am.Everyone had already packed their luggage to go home, but on Tuesday morning, the day we were due to disembark, the captain suddenly announced that ten people had been infected, meaning all of us would be confined to our rooms for 14 days of mandatory quarantine. From that minute forward, we haven’t left our cabins and food is delivered to us three times a day, although we never know at what time.We went from eating steak and lobster to bad buffet food, but I don’t want to complain about that as they have to push out 10,000 meals a day, and flew in reinforcements from Los Angeles as it was so overwhelming.Each day starts early because someone is usually banging on the door by 7:30am. The first thing I do when I get up is pull my curtain open to allow  the sunlight to stream in and show I’ve made it to another day.I have a small area where I can do stretching and yoga. The ship has also loaded up some tai-chi videos. We’ve got wifi, a flat screen TV with movies and multiple channels to watch the news or shows. We’ve got digital books and I’ve signed up for an online herbal class. I’ve got time!But the worst part of the strict quarantine is the anxieties that prey on your mind. There are so many unknowns.Even at night, I leave the balcony door open. It’s cold and I sleep with my coat on but I want fresh air because I’m worried about the virus moving through the ship’s air ventilation system.People with inside cabins are now being allowed out on deck more frequently, which makes me wonder if there’s a concentration of positive tests from these passengers.It also feels like something has changed on the ship, as if they’re running chemicals through the air vents because all day my eyes have been burning, and I can smell it.We’re also now required to wear a facemask as we open our doors. We’ve heard that 5 out of 65 newly infected with the coronavirus were crewmembers, and now the fear has set in that some were the people delivering our meals.We don’t know what’s going on outside our cabin doors, and I cannot overstate how stressful and anxiety-provoking it is that people in the outside world find out about new cases and developments on the ship before we do.It’s infuriating, upsetting and disrespectful that we’re not getting told before the media. I feel like there’s a complete lack of respect from the Japanese Health Ministry, that they’re not notifying people on the ship first.We know the number of infections is going to increase but we’re upset about how the information is being shared. It’s affecting our lives deeply.People are losing work, they can’t go home to family, thousands had to cancel and re-arrange flights.We also don’t understand the logic of not testing everyone for the virus, now that we have 135 cases. What if people have it with no symptoms?In the end, all we can do is to support each other, and a group of us on board have been doing that through a Facebook group and calling each other in our cabins.In the group, people do card tricks, post memes, jokes, anything that makes us feel better connected.I’m a social worker so I offered phone support for anyone who is feeling overwhelmed or wants counselling sessions. The people who have been most impacted are the couples who have been separated - one being removed and staying behind.And the other people who are badly impacted are the ones here with small children. Can you imagine trying to keep a child confined in a space like this?I miss the familiar things of home, like the little movie theatre, my favourite taco place, the back roads and the wine. They will not let us have any alcohol in our cabins. Can someone help with that?But if you ask me if I wish I hadn’t come on the cruise, then no, I have no regrets! And I certainly won’t forget it.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/07/11/istock-187287146.jpg","title":"cycle to work bike cycling london 2020 environment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lycra-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That requires precise control, and engineers have so far been unable to do it.This is life under the longest internet shutdown in historyNow researchers think they have found a way of controlling that very fast modulation, using sound and light.This is exciting research,\u0026nbspsaid John Cunningham, Professor of Nanoelectronics at Leeds. At the moment, the system for modulating a quantum cascade laser is electrically driven - but that system has limitations.Ironically, the same electronics that delivers the modulation usually puts a brake on the speed of the modulation. The mechanism we are developing relies instead on acoustic waves.When an electron passes through the optical part of the laser, it travels through a host of quantum wells that throw out a pulse of light energy. An electron can emit a number of those photons, and that is controlled – using soundwaves\u0026nbspto vibrate those quantum wells – in the new experiment.Essentially, what we did was use the acoustic wave to shake the intricate electronic states inside the quantum cascade laser, said\u0026nbspTony Kent, Professor of Physics at Nottingham. We could then see that its\u0026nbspterahertz\u0026nbsplight output was being altered by the acoustic wave.The research is not perfect, and more control is still needed before the lasers could be used reliably to transmit data. But with further work they could lead to major breakthroughs in transmitting data.We did not reach a situation where we could stop and start the flow completely, but we were able to control the light output by a few percent, which is a great start, said Professor Cunningham.We believe that with further refinement, we will be able to develop a new mechanism for complete control of the photon emissions from the laser, and perhaps even integrate structures generating sound with the terahertz laser, so that no external sound source is needed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If this were the case, banks and other financial institutions could base themselves in the UK knowing they might not be frozen out by EU regulators one day to the next.As a result of Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, City firms will lose their automatic passporting rights to keep doing business on the continent.Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

But in the primary’s last few days, someone else broke into the upper tier.Arise, Amy Klobuchar, a longtime senator who just happens to hail from one of the most important states on the Democrats’ target list: Minnesota.For all the talk about the so-called “blue wall” states that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016, namely Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Klobuchar’s home state is one of several traditionally safe Democratic states that slipped perilously close to turning red.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTop (or bottom) of that list is New Hampshire, which Clinton won by only 0.37 points — but Minnesota is second. Clinton defeated Trump there by just 44,765 votes, or 1.52 points. As the Democrats try and build an electoral college majority once again, that’s close enough to be deeply concerning.Created with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds up a sign criticising billionaires in the presidential race in front of Michael Bloomberg in Compton, Califronia.

From left to right: Billionaire-philanthropist Tom Steyer, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former vice president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota senator Amy KlobucharBut thanks to Clinton’s near miss, its moment in the sun has come. The Democrats need to hold on to every state they can, and that’s before they pick up several others. And so, to Klobuchar.Since the start of her campaign, she has consistently argued that winning three consecutive\u0026nbspsenate elections for her Minnesota seat proves she can hold on to or win back Midwestern swing states. That record does rather set her apart from the rest of the Democratic top tier:\u0026nbspPete Buttigeig has only won mayoral elections in a small city, in a state the Democrats look highly unlikely to win this year, while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders hail from Democratic home turf in Massachusetts and Vermont.\u0026nbspAnd while much has been made of Joe Biden’s roots in Pennsylvania, his decades-long career was in tiny and ultra-safe Delaware, and his floundering campaign may not even get him through the looming South Carolina primary.Klobuchar’s record therefore makes her uniquely appealing, and she seems well-placed to leverage it today. Political scientist and US politics expert Brian Klaas said: “Klobuchar is popular across the state,” boasting “approval ratings that reflect her ability to win over swing voters but also win over some Republicans”.On the face of it, this was borne out by her re-election as senator in 2018, when she won 57 of Minnesota’s 87 counties and bested her Republican challenger by 24 points. But in fact, her performance somewhat ebbed even in a year where the Democrats did well nationwide — and more concerning still, her vote apparently shifted away from “Trump country” towards the state’s urban centres.For 2020 Democrats, Granite State is boom or bustHow much does winning the New Hampshire primary actually matter?There’s only one Democrat who can oust TrumpAccording to Klaas, this may not be enough in an election with Trump on the ballot. “For a Democrat to win in Minnesota, they need to do well statewide. They need to run up a substantial margin in the Twin Cities — the neighbouring cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul that straddle the Mississippi — but they can’t win just with cities.“They need to have support in the suburbs, which are often swing districts but broke for the Democrats in the 2018 midterms. And rural Minnesota is largely Trump territory these days, but soybean farmers in the south are being hit badly by Trump’s trade war, and many iron ore miners in the northeast Iron Range who voted for Trump come from union households that have voted for Democrats for generations.”So can Klobuchar do it? Even beyond the so-called “home state advantage”, which has been the subject of decades of academic research, she has several advantages over Hillary Clinton: she isn’t trying to win her party a third consecutive term, she has relatively little baggage of her own, and she’s running against a controversial Republican incumbent.But first, she has to win the nomination.

The young folk born this century, like my -year-old daughter, do not watch it. The BBC means nothing to Generation YouTube.And the millions of us who grew up with the Beeb no longer recognise it as the benign Auntie that gave us Doctor Who, Top Of The Pops, Le On Earth, Fawlty Towers, The Likely Lads and David Dimbleby staying up all night at the General Election.That old beloved BBC — endlessly entertaining, scrupulously fair — is dead now. The BBC’s coverage of the night we left the European Union was nothing less than shameful.Here was a moment of truly historical signicance, the kind of national event that the BBC was born to cover. And it was dished up like a dull night at the Eurovision Song Contest.Down in Parliament Square, awash with Union Jacks and peaceful, happy patriots, BBC reporter Geeta Guru-Murthy blurted: “It’s a very white crowd mostly” — to the bewilderment of the many black and Asian people who were there to celebrate.But, of course, the BBC continues to peddle the filthy little lie that Brexit has its roots in the racism of the bigoted British people.Meanwhile, Sophie Raworth sat primly in a BBC studio made up to look like the EU flag. The studio never turned red, white and blue. There was no sense that the largest vote for anything in British history was being honoured. Why must we pay £billion a year for this one-sided garbage My colleague Ally Ross has pointed out that BBC “comedy” shows like Have I Got News For You, Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and The Mash Report have all been larded with anti-Brexit orthodoxy for years. Now the predictably loony Remainer-speak even seeps into the poison the BBC drips into our children.On the day we left the EU, the BBC released a CBBC Horrible Histories special mocking British stupidity.Queen Victoria was accused of callously sweetening her tea with sugar harvested by slaves — even though slavery was abolished four years before Victoria came to the throne.Historian Andrew Roberts described the mocking film as “a stream of bigoted hatred directed at this country”. They truly don’t get it in Broadcasting House. Millions of licence fee payers are deeply offended by the BBC’s relentlessly anti-British, anti-Brexit sentiment.It is why we fell out of love with the BBC. There is talk about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, or making payment optional. But the BBC no longer represents the entire nation. It peddles the prejudices of the disappointed elite who run it.The BBC does not speak for the British people. It doesn’t even seem to like us very much. So why should we pay anything at all for this crap AFTER being overlooked at the Oscars for her sensational performance in Hustlers, the half-time show at the Super Bowl felt like the revenge of Jenner Lopez.But Hustlers is my favourite film of the past  months. Lopez deserved an Oscar for her role.And whoever wins Best Actress at the Oscars tonight, I bet they can’t slide down a pole like her.MICHELLE OBAMA always said: “When they go low, we go high.”Meaning that when the Republican opponents of President Obama struck a low blow the Obamas had a strict policy of keeping their cool, their dignity and the moral high ground.The most senior Democratic politician in America just failed to take Michelle Obama’s advice. At his State of the Union address, President Trump petulantly refused to shake the hand of NancyPelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi should have shrugged off Trump’s rudeness and perhaps laughed in Donald’s orange face.Instead, clearly boiling with rage, Nancy ripped a copy of Trump’s speech to pieces. As the speech was full of optimistic stuff about making America a fairer, more prosperous place, the only person Pelosi humiliated was herself.The Democrats are starting to make Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party look like an effective opposition.THE classic James Bond films – Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger – were all less than two hours long.But in the modern fashion for over-long movies – The Irishman clocks in at three hours and  minutes – the next Bond film, No Time To Die, will be the longest ever at almost three hours.Let’s hope that means plenty of Ana de Armas, , as Bond girl Paloma. And not too much of Daniel Craig, , moaning about ’s dodgy knees.Teenage girls are messier than teenage boys. But teenage boys are, in my experience, more likely to leave takeaway pizza under the bed for six months for the mice to nibble.And when vermin move in, you really long for your little darling to move out.SUCKING up to the millionaire snowflakes in the audience, Prince William complained about the lack of ersity at the Baftas.I don’t believe it. This year a black actor, Micheal Ward, won the Rising Star Bafta for gang film Blue Story. Six years ago,  Years A Slave won Best Picture, competing with epic Hollywood fare like Gravity.If the film or performance is good enough, then the Baftas is colour blind.The real lack of ersity is among British actors. These days most of them went to Eton with Prince William. Now that’s what I call a lack of ersity.A SURVEY reveals that  per cent of Canadians are against paying the £million to-£million-a-year security bill for Harry and Meghan’s new le.Wherever they lay their hats, from Toronto to Tinsel Town, there is only one sucker who will ever pay for Harry and Meghan’s security.

But providing it does so through democratic means only, that should not upset many people.After all, it is up to the people of Northern Ireland, through a referendum, to decide whether they want to remain part of the UK or to join Ireland.Sinn Fein can, however, be relied upon to be even more hostile than Leo Varadkar — up until now Ireland’s leader — towards Britain in trade negotiations with the EU.If the party can score some kind of victory by opposing UK proposals, it will do so, making it more likely we will have no trade deal by December .Sinn Fein has used Brexit to its advantage, trying to drive a wedge between Britain and those in Northern Ireland who traditionally want to stay part of the Union.By negotiating a deal which puts some kind of border down the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson’s government has helped Sinn Fein’s cause. Former Irish leader Bertie Aern claimed yesterday that a referendum on a united Ireland will now come before the end of the decade.“I think a border poll is inevitable,” he said. “I think it’s probably five years off at least but the Sinn Fein position is it should be held within five years.”It is easy to see a scenario in which Northern Ireland votes to leave the UK and join Ireland, followed by a Scottish vote for independence.I am not sure where that would leave Boris’s plans for a Belfast to Stranraer bridge, which of course would have been paid for mostly by English taxpayers.All this said, however, there is little to suggest that those who voted for Sinn Fein on Sunday were motivated by concerns over Brexit or by a desire for a united Ireland.Strip away its dubious past and Sinn Fein is now a party of the Corbynite Left — it wants far greater social programmes, all funded by the wealthy.This could have serious consequences in a country whose economic success is founded on low taxes, especially company taxes. Ireland’s corporation tax rate is just . per cent, compared with  per cent in the UK. That has helped it become a magnet for investment.In terms of GDP per head, Ireland was poorer than the UK  years ago, but now it is signicantly richer.But whatSinn Fein was able to do what Jeremy Corbyn promised to do and soak the rich We might no longer have a Celtic Tiger on our doorstep, but a Celtic Sloth. The likes of Amazon and Google, which have established big presences in Ireland for tax purposes, might want to sht operations to Britain instead.Leo Varadkar had hoped he would be rewarded at the ballot box for holding a tough line in Brexit negotiations, but Ireland’s housing crisis seems to have been a far stronger concern.Ireland, even more so than Britain, has suffered from property booms and busts over the past two decades.Many young people have been priced out of the housing market and are struggling to even rent. Sinn Fein did well because it promised a three-year rent freeze and , new homes.These pledges helped the party — which has dominated Republican politics in Northern Ireland — come out of the margins south of the border and break the duopoly of the two main partiesIt won . per cent of the vote, while Fianna Fail, a socially conservative party, won  per cent, and Fine Gael, the more economically and socially liberal party of Leo Varadkar, won just  per cent.If Ireland had Britain’s first-past-the-post system, it would have been a landslide — Sinn Fein topped the poll in  of the country’s  constituencies.But given Ireland’s system of multi-member constituencies, it is far from guaranteed that Sinn Fein will even be in government at all.Before the election, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael both said they would not go into government with Sinn Fein. They could go into coalition with each other.In fact, Fianna Fail was already propping up Fine Gael in a confidence and supply arrangement. But with Sinn Fein topping the poll, this might prove a more dficult position to hold.Sinn Fein says it is exploring trying to put together a government without either of the main parties.But despite winning the biggest share of the vote, Ireland’s political establishment may yet succeed in keeping it out of power — and away from messing up the Irish economy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Defra is looking much more favourably on  years.“With negotiations with the US fast-approaching, this is a decision that needs to be made.”A government spokesperson said: “Our landmark Agriculture Bill will reform our agriculture policy, putting the interests of farmers and land managers, the environment and taxpayers at its core as we free ourselves from the EU’s bureaucratic Common Agricultural Policy.“As part of this, we’ve been clear that farmers will have a seven-year agricultural transition period to plan ahead and adjust to these changes.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBoris Johnson is set to step up his plan to apostake revengeapos on judges after suffering another humiliating defeat at the hands of the courts. It comes after the Court of Appeal ruled against the government, preventing them from deporting  foreign offenders scheduled to be on a deportation flight this morning. The Prime Minister has already announced a “constitution, democracy and rights commission” tasked with ensuring judicial reviews are not “abused to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays.”Mr Johnson was left fuming after judges unanimously ruled his plan to shut down parliament and ram his Brexit plan through was unlawful.Judicial reviewis the process where members of the public can take the government to court to rule on whether their actions are lawful. It’s a crucial power of the court system, and exists to make sure governments - however strong their hold on power - have to operate within the law. The Conservative manesto promised to examine the JR process to ensure it is not abused for political reasons. Downing Street said it bitterly regretted the Court of Appeal decision and Government sources said the row over the deportation flight showed why an examination of JR was needed.  A dozen separate applications for JR were filed in recent days in relation to the deportation flight, sources said. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: The legal process for removing these offenders, which has included repeated appeals and judicial reviews, has already cost the British public tens of thousands of pounds. Dominic Cummings, one of the Prime Ministeraposs closest aides, said there must be urgent action on the farce that judicial review has become following the Court of Appeal decision, ITV News reported. The Tories also seized on Labouraposs criticism of the flight and claimed it showed they have not learned the lesson of the  electoral drubbing. A senior Government source said: The Westminster bubbleaposs view in trying to halt this flight with repeated JRs makes the case perfectly to the public about why such a review is needed and why certain parts of Westminster still havenapost learned the lesson from the  election. Labour has challenged the Government in Parliament about allowing the flight to take off before the findings of the review into the Windrush scandal have been published.Amanda Pinto QC, chair of the Bar Council, said: Judicial review is a hugely important tool in a democratic society by which decisions of public authorities, including government, are subject to legal scrutiny. Far from being a mark of dys, judicial review is an appropriate check on decision-making, of which a nation should be proud.  She added: We have not yet seen details of what a aposreviewapos of the judicial review process might look like, but anything that seeks to limit the ability of ordinary citizens to challenge decisions of those with power is a red flag. Caroline Goodwin QC, of the Criminal Bar Association, said: Judicial review is a process to keep a check on authorities acting beyond the legal remit that may have been granted to them by the law, thus playing a part to ensure the law applies equally to everyone this is what the rule of law means.Shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti said: There is no democracy without the rule of law. These attacks on journalists and judges are chronic symptoms of an entitled Tory Government that is desperate to avoid scrutiny, and is out of control. When the review was first mooted last month, Baroness Chakrabarti told the Mirror it was revenge for losing -nil in the Supreme Court. She added: It’s like losing -nil in the cup final and coming with a baseball bat for the referee.” Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: These Tory attacks on our courts, judicial review and the Human Rights Act are all designed to weaken ordinary people and enable ministers to act with impunity. They are the actions of despots, not democrats.

Harry Meadows is standing trial accused of being part of a gang which blew up cash machines in the Costa del Sol. The -year-old is arguing that he should not be put before a Spanish court because he cannot understand what is going on, The Liverpool Echo reported. Meadows is wanted by a court in Malaga in connection with raids on  ATMs between December  and February . The gang behind the spree used handmade explosives to blow up the cash machines from Malaga to Marbella, netting £, in the process. The Whiston, Merseyside man spent three months in a Spanish prison after he was arrested before being allowed toto the UK. Now he is fighting the authorityaposs attempts to have him and at least five other suspects flown back to Spain to stand trial. Despite his extradition being approved by a judge at Westminster Magistratesapos Court in November , the legal battle is ongoing.  Reporting of the trial had been restricted until the murder trial of Meadowsapos son James, who was shot in the head, was concluded. In June, the High Court heard that Meadows was born deaf and had limited reading and writing skills, while never having learned sign language. It was claimed he was unfit to stand trial in Spain because he would not be able to understand proceedings. And while he can lip-read, his barrister argued Meadows “required a specialist lip-speaker who could pronounce words, and shape lips, to produce a Liverpool accent, a specialism rare in England, and rarer still in Spain”. The suspect, who denies the allegations against him, has been examined by a host of specialists for the legal row. Dr Sue OaposRourke, a consultant clinical psychologist instructed on behalf of Meadows, found: “In the event that he has to appear in court in Spain, he would be unable to follow proceedings. “Assuming that there would be a Spanish to English interpreter, this would not allow him access for two reasons. “Firstly, his ability to lipread is severely limited. Lipreading is a dficult and imprecise skill and he is not very good at it. “Lip pattern is affected by accent and there is inidual iation he appears to lipread his family best and then people from the same area of the country.”  She added he would be “unable to lipread and understand what is being said” as parts of any trial would be unfamiliar to him. Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Manjit Gahir found Meadows had dficulties communicating and suffered from a mental health disorder. He would be unable to participate in the court process especiallyit is undertaken in a foreign language in Spain, the doctor said. A consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Cumming, questioned the arguments made against extradition. He noted that the dad-of-seven had been through the British courts  times and had been sentenced to three years in prison for ram-raiding an ATM in . While accepting any trial in Spain would need a “considerable level of planning, expense and confidence that he would be able to get through that process.” He concluded:  “In my opinion the issue is largely technical and the judicial system is likely to be far more challenging for someone of Mr Meadowaposs level of ing... I was not convinced around his lack of recognition around his previous offences and as I tried to probe further he refused to discuss. “This seemed in my opinion deliberate and being awkward. This again seems to infer a certain level of capability and ing in being able to make that choice decision.” Meadows told the doctor that he went to Spain for a holiday for a few weeks in December . He said he was not involved in any criminal activity.

Ann Sim, of Runsom, Exeter, was given a suspended jail sentence yesterday and banned from keeping equines for ten years. A court heard some of the ponies were emaciated, in poor body condition and had overgrown feet. One was blind in one eye and they were living in filthy stables littered with rubbish. District Judge Miss Jo Matson sentenced her at Exeter magistrates court and said: This was an equine rescue centre, it should have been a place of safety for these ponies. But she said some of the  horses and ponies there were neglected, in poor body condition and emaciated. They were kept in fields with insufficient nutrition and with wire fences which could endanger the animals, as well as a lack of veterinary care. She said the ponies suffered over a period of months - even after the RSPCA had given -year-old Sim a warning and advice in March . Miss Matson said:I accept it was not a deliberate act on your behalf. The mother-of-three, who has lost her home and whose relationship ended last year, admitted three charges of causing unnecessary suffering under the Animal Welfare Act between June and September last year at the North Devon Equine Rescue centre at Runsom near Barnstaple.  She was given a jail sentence of ten weeks, suspended for  months, banned from keeping equines for a decade and ordered to pay £ costs. All of the animals have been rehomed. RSPCA prosecutor Kevin Withey said the animals had been neglected and were living in filthy conditions with a lack of food.

Harriet bought her first sausage dog, Missy,  years ago after begging her parents to let her have one. Missy went on to have two litters of puppies and Harriet kept one from each - Button and Duke. Duke then found love with a dachshund named Ivy and had his own litter, so the family grew as Harriet decided to keep one of their puppies, adding Apple to make five in total.The Sausage Squad, as they are known have become a big hit on Instagram, wracking up more than , followers."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Alloa-Dundee-United.jpg ","title":"bow united no longer jealous of other clubs","story":"Academies weren’t a part of football when Dave Bowman was making his way in the game.However, the Dundee United legend feels they are becoming increasingly important after the club’s youth set-up recently achieved Elite status.Former United midfielder Bow, player transition coach at the club’s academy, is delighted the Tangerines have reached that landmark in the Scottish FA’s Project Brave initiative just a year after restructuring operations.The -year-old, who spent  years as a player at Tannadice and many more in ious back-room roles, believes the club has made great strides to become “frontrunners” in youth football rather than looking at others with envy.“We’re hopeful here, with the good environment and discipline instilled into them, that we can get results,” Bowman said.“We’ve got everything available now because of the work done by the owners and Tony Asghar.“With them coming in it’s sort of evolved the whole thing. We used to be jealous of what other clubs were doing before but we’re now probably one of the frontrunners.“We’re doing a lot of things other teams are aspiring to do. Because of the money and finance put in, it certainly makes your job a lot easier and helps a long way.“When you’re attracting young players to join the club, you want the kids to come into an elite environment rather than what it was before.“We weren’t bad before but there was no finance to do it properly. Andy Goldie is driving it on and we’ve managed to get to Elite status which is brilliant.“Restructuring the whole thing has meant new faces have come in with new ideas.“It’s about evolving all the time, you can’t just sit and accept it because that’s what was happening  or  years ago.”That said, Bow still believes attitude is what will help players get to where they want to be, citing former United man and Liverpool star Andy Robertson as an example.“That’s one of the biggest things I see with kids that are talented,” he added.“It’s how you install it into them to give that extra %. When you come out the other end of an academy, that’s the bit that will help you.“You need to be disciplined. Even since I played, and it’s changed a lot since then, football’s been like that.“You can’t go out every night, you’ve got to practice things and get the basics right first before you work on your game.“We’re wanting to give them the whole package by putting all the fragments together and glue them so we get better players at the end of the day. vw, px\"  “I’m a great believer in always getting to where you want to go.“You could stay here, play in the first team and,you’re good enough, you could always move.“We’ve had one recently with Banksy .“Andy Robertson is a fine example, to have came from Queen’s Park then come up here.“From us he probably could’ve gone straight to a Liverpool or a higher team but he went to Hull and earned his stripes.“Sometimes they want to accelerate it and get from down at E right up to A straight away, rather than working their way up.“That’s the way it goes sometimes and I’ve seen others like wee Gauldy .“I’d have put my mortgage on wee Gauldy being a success at Sporting eventually but, unfortunately for him, things turn out dferent ways.“He’s still playing in Portugal, of course, but he was the one I thought would’ve kicked on.“If I’d looked at Andy and Gauldy back then I’d have probably said Gauldy was the better player. It says a lot about Andy’s character as well and his real drive and determination.”Not everyone can be Andy Robertson, though, Bowman concedes.“I always think the Dutch are a brilliant example because even when players leave the likes of PSV and Ajax, they’ll go where.#Whereas, sometimes in Scotland they’ll drop out of academies and then football altogether.“We’d like to see those boys progress and keep playing as well. That’s a big part of my job, too.“I hope that when they come in full-time with us, they’ll aspire to be players at one level or another.“They’ve just got to show what they’re about. If you want to give that extra , , % to get there it will help you in the end.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e1d87ad189e41.81565320-536x564.jpg ","title":"current dundee crop must find their voices says former hero rae","story":"A squad packed with huge characters roared Dundee to their last Championship title.Now the skipper of that side has challenged the Dark Blues’ beleaguered current crop to find their voices.Gavin Rae capped a glittering -year playing career by leading Dundee to the Premiership six years ago.It was a team full of influential figures.And Rae wants the top boys in today’s side – two of whom he knows well – to instil some pride ahead of a crucial play-off run-in.“I came up against Christophe Berra on a number of occasions,” said Rae.“He was always a tough opponent – and he’s got loads of experience to draw on.“Graham Dorrans, I roomed with him on Scotland duty. It was very late in my international career and very early in his to be fair!“But you just have to look at his career to see the quality he’s got. You don’t play in the Premier League for as many years as he did without being a very, very good footballer.“These are the guys that can turn it round for Dundee – the big characters.“The season I captained the team to the Championship title, we had loads of characters in that dressing-room, and it kept us going through what was a rollercoaster season.“It was touch and go at times but guys like Peter McDonald, Ian Davidson, myself, Kyle Benedictus and Christian Nade kept it ticking over.“You need leaders in any successful team, and with Christophe and Graham in the current side, they should be the ones setting the standards.”Standards of late have not been high enough at Dens Park.A run of four Championship games without a win since the festive season has seen the Dens men drop out of the play-off places.For a side who started the season with designs on a title charge, that is a cause for concern.But Rae believes the talent peppering the Dee squad ought to be enough to turn the tide – and ensure at least a shot at a quickfireto the Premiership.“If you look at the Dundee side, there are guys with plenty of Premiership experience there,” he said.“You’ve got Jack Hamilton at the back, Christophe in front of him, Dorrans in the middle, Kane Hemmings up top . . . the list goes on.“These are the guys James McPake will be asking to drive the team on in the second half of the season. vw, px\"  “They’ve been there and done it – some of them at a very high level.“So you have to think thatthey turn it on, they’ve got enough about them to get Dundee firing again.“Things have been tough in recent weeks and being out of the play-off places is not good.“The players have to fight to turn that round because another season in the Championship isn’t ideal – and it could easily happen.“But, for me, there should be enough experience and quality there to turn the tide.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/19831881-940x552.jpg ","title":"dundee 2 0 partick hemmings double earns dark blues first win of 2020 with dominant display","story":"Dundee finally picked up their first victory of  with a dominant - victory over bottom club Partick Thistle at Dens Park.Two first-half Kane Hemming goals did the damage for the Dark Blues as they moved back into the play-off places with a first three points since beating the Jags at Firhill on December .Dens boss James McPake made three changes after Cammy Kerr and Jordan McGhee underwent surgery during the week.That saw Josh Meekings come in to join Christophe Berra and Jordon Forster in a back three while Paul McGowan ed to partner Kane Hemmings up front and Christie Elliott made his first start.Andrew Nelson was on the bench after recovering from surgery himself alongside new signing Tom Field.The home side made a positive start and got the all-important breakthrough on  minutes.It stemmed from Meekings launching a throw into the Partick box and earning a corner. Declan McDaid lofted the kick into the box for Forster to steam in and head goalwards, only to see striker Hemmings knock it in on the line.Minutes later Dario Zanatta flashed a low shot wide of Conor Hazard#s post before Hemmings got his second of the afternoon on  minutes.Shaun Byrne#s long punt up top was miscontrolled and McGowan was all over the mistake. He played in his strike partner, who brushed off the Partick defence to fire past Scott Fox.Partick came out with more le about them in the second half with Zanatta a threat but Dundee were still creating chances and went close six minutes after the restart.First, McDaid saw a low cross kicked away by goalkeeper Fox before Ross Callachan was played in but could only hit the keeper with his effort from inside the area.On the hour, Christie broke forward but took the wrong option in choosing to shoot rather than pass before Fox again beat out a dangerous McDaid cross on  minutes.On  minutes, Dundee lost Callachan as he was stretchered off injured with Nelson replacing him.With six minutes to go, Brian Graham looked to have the chance to give the Jags a leline but he handled when controlling and the chance was gone.In the closing stages the Dark Blues were happy to see the game out as they moved back to fourth spot, three points behind second-placed Inverness.Dundee: Hazard, Forster, Meekings , Berra, McDaid, Christie, Byrne , McGowan, Dorrans, Callachan , Hemmings .Subs not used: Hamilton, Field, Cameron, Strachan.Partick: Fox, Penrice, O#Ware , Brownlie, Cardle , Bannigan, Graham, Cole, Zanatta, Barjonas , O#Connor .Subs not used: Sneddon, Robson, Austin.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/02/Dundee-v-Partick-350x564.jpg ","title":"field set to make bow against jags","story":"Left-back Tom Field is set to be thrust straight into the Dundee starting line-up this weekend.The -year-old joined the Dark Blues late last Friday after news of first-choice Jordan Marshall’s injury came back worse than first feared.Scan results on the thigh injury Marshall picked up in training arrived around lunchtime on the day of the transfer deadline.That forced manager James McPake into swt action to add cover in the shape of Field, who had left boyhood club Brentford earlier that day.With the late arrival, last weekend’s clash at Greenock Morton came too soon to make his debut with Jordan McGhee playing in the unfamiliar role on the left of defence.After meeting his new team-mates and training all week, Field is now likely to make his bow in dark blue against Partick Thistle on Saturday.To give him some match action, Field took part in a bounce game at Stirling Albion on Tuesday in which Andrew Nelson and Paul McGowan also featured after missing out at Cappielow through injury.Nelson, who scored in the match, has been out since the turn of the year after surgery to fix a broken hand.After seeing Christophe Berra and Christie Elliott make their debuts at Morton with Conor Hazard making a second bow after ing on loan, Field is likely to make his first outing against the Jags.Manager James McPake said: “Tom Field trained this week.“Jordan Marshall being out is disappointing because he’s been excellent.“He will miss eight weeks at least, maybe .“It’s a problem deep in the thigh muscle so it’s dficult to know when it has healed.“Jordan is an explosive player so we have to make sure he is right with that one.”Berra, meanwhile, made his first appearance in over a month last weekend and manager James was pleased with his start to le at the club.He added: “Christophe was good. At the end, he admitted he was tired, it was his first  minutes in six weeks so, for that, he was really good.“Jordon Forster was really good beside him and the full-backs did well.“It’s not easy when balls come into your box constantly but I thought they held their own.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d809951299439.77376504-910x564.jpg ","title":"michelin pledges 5m investment in dundee area with at least 850 jobs expected to be created","story":"Michelin is relaunching a scheme which the company says will help create hundreds of jobs in Dundee and Angus, worth around £ million.Michelin Development will provide funding and advice to firms with the potential to expand – providing high-quality, long-term employment, bosses have said.The firm said #at least  jobs are expected to be created# and Michelin Development has also #targeted support for  new jobs#.Funding from Michelin Development could be used to attract companies involved in the green transport industry to the new Michelin Scotland Innovation Parc .MSIP is a joint venture between Dundee City Council, Michelin, and Scottish Enterprise.It aims to drive growth and ersity in the Scottish economy while addressing the global climate emergency.Bosses aim to deliver #a world class innovation centre, driving global research  while influencing and supporting breakthroughs in sustainable mobility and low carbon energy#.The news comes as politicians and business leaders from across the region will attend an event today to learn more about the £m programme.Successful applicants could receive unsecured, heavily-subsidised loans and free, independent and expert advice to pave the way for growth, Michelin Development said.It was announced in November  that the firm would close the plant, with the loss of all  jobs.The tyre factory is due to cease production by the middle of   after the French firm deemed it #unsuitable# in the current climate.Michelin Development said it will target inward investment by providing grants for companies looking to set up in Dundee.Bosses are urging businesses with high potential, and medium-sized enterprises in and around Dundee, Arbroath, Carnoustie and Forfar – or businesses considering investing in these areas – to get in touch.Mike Cole, head of Michelin Development in the UK, said: “Manufacturing, engineering or business to business service companies with fewer than  employees are eligible.“If you have a solid business plan and the potential to create high-quality jobs, but you just need that bit of extra help, then we want to hear from you.“Michelin Development is here to support employment in and around Dundee by helping high-potential firms and entrepreneurs turn their ambitions into reality.”Loans of up to £, are available, and they can be used to lever additional funding from other sources.The event will take place at the MSIP – and funding from Michelin Development could be used to attract companies involved in the green transport industry to the new facility.At least  jobs are expected to be created at MSIP, and Michelin Development has also targeted support for  new jobs.John Reid, Michelin Dundee factory manager and the chief executive of MSIP, said: “This is a signicant announcement for MSIP, for the Michelin Group and for the Dundee area as a whole.“When we announced in  that the Michelin Dundee factory was to close in , we pledged to support our employees and deliver a legacy that will benefit the regional economy for generations to come.“We are determined to create at least  jobs on the Michelin Scotland Innovation Parc and Michelin Development is another string to our bow.

the s.From horse-drawn affairs to the more modern electric offerings, trams were a popular and easy way to travel around the city.A new book illustrating the forgotten history of Aberdeen’s famous trams is to be published later this month.Author Peter Waller’s The Lost Tramways Of Scotland: Aberdeen is due to hit the shelves on February .It explores the rich history of the mode of transport.Published by Graffeg, the book aims to draw attention to the transport system, and documents how it was developed in Aberdeen throughout the years, and how it affected the community.It also looks into the social history of the city from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries.Each page includes stunning photos of the historic vehicles, taken from the Online Transport Archive, which show the layout of the streets at the time.Mr Waller, director and secretary of the Online Transport Archive, has been writing about transport for the past  years.Aberdeen had two electric tramways – the corporation’s services within the city and the Aberdeen Suburban Tramways Co, although this was short-lived.The vehicles covered a large portion of Aberdeen, going as far as Bankhead, Bucksburn, Woodside, Kittybrewster, Bridge of Don, the Beach, Torry, Duthie Park, Bridge of Dee, Woodend and Hazlehead and into the West End as far as Bieldside.City centre areas such as Queens Cross, Rosemount, Union Street and Ferryhill were also serviced.Depots were created to house the vehicles.The first such depot to be built was in Queens Cross.It opened on August  .In the years after Second

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory. The first part of the race ended at Ardrishaig, after which the yachts went through the Crinan Canal.The winners at Ardrishaig were:-Class . st Sally of Kamesh m s.nd Fulmarh m srd Vandah m sExtract from the Glasgow Herald of Monday, July :-Clyde Cruising ClubThe  yachts which raced from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory under the burgee of the Clyde Cruising Club got a rare dusting and with as much wind as they wished the bigger boats came into their own. The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages. The -metre yacht Cerigo arrived first at Tobermory from Crinan in  secs short of  hours.Results:-Class  Fulmar– h m s Sally of Kames– h m s Arcturus– h m sVandah m s. Helenh m s. Torridonh m s.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this. Young people like her give me hope for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"john-muir-house-car-park-opened-public","story":"The car park, off Court Street, is home to about  spaces but can only be used by council employees and council HQ visitors between am and pm during the working week.That could soon change, with a number of spaces potentially being made available for public weekday daytime use.The idea comes as the council looks to increase the overall number of short and long stay car parking spaces in and around the town centre.Last year, discussions took place with members of the public surrounding the idea of creating a lsquotransport hubrsquo off the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.Now, a further two-day consultation is taking place in Haddington Town House, when members of the public can discuss parking issues in the town.The consultation will focus on parking throughout Haddington, including possibly changing the long-stay car park near the townrsquos Tesco store into a short-stay car park.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoFor many years, wersquove been keen to enhance the town centre so that it offers the best possible environment for all users ndash including people with restricted mobility, pedestrians and cyclists ndash to ensure easy access to the local services and businesses on which Haddington depends.ldquoAs well as improved options for active travel and public transport, we recognise there is a need to create more parking spaces in and around the town centre.ldquoFor this to happen, we need to change some existing parking from long stay to short stay, and deliver a new long-stay parking option for drivers who need to leave their vehicle in the town throughout the working day.ldquoOne proposal is the potential re-designation of the existing lsquoTesco long-stayrsquo car park, which could free up an additional  spaces in the town centre for short-stay, public parking.ldquoWe will also review the status of the car park at John Muir House, East Lothian Councilrsquos head office, to consider the potential for an area here to be available for wider public use.More than  people attended the previous exhibition in the Town House.

They have no rivals. But it shouldnrsquot be this way.It doesnrsquot matter that independence has been at the heart of SNP philosophy since the partyrsquos inception. At this stage of the nationrsquos history, to permit one party to control the narrative around the future of Scotland is to fatally wound the way our democracy should work. Independence needs a plurality of voices and of thought. A singular, clunking, hierarchical party machine isnrsquot fit for such a momentous task.But praise where itrsquos due, the SNPrsquos great success is the journey itrsquos taken from the fringes of political le to representing the status quo. Part of that great success was changing the narrative around independence. Like the party, the issue of independence moved from the outer limits of politics to centre stage.Today, itrsquos independence which will probably decide how a citizen casts their vote in Scotland. This creates a dangerous warp in the fabric of our democracy, however. Many voters, who see independence as their prime political ambition, hold the SNP to lower standards than they would any other party.They turn a blind eye to the partyrsquos failings because the SNP is seen as the only vehicle which can achieve independence. You donrsquot shoot your own horse when itrsquos in a race ndash you cheer it on at the top of your voice.The SNPrsquos enmeshment in the Yes movement works like a force field, protecting it from flak and scandal that would destroy any other party.This is great for the SNP but not so much for Scotland. The SNP record on health, education, policing, drug deaths, homelessness and economics, is increasingly poor, yet it just keeps dodging bullets. That big Yes badge on the partyrsquos lapel keeps it safe. The Saltire has become a political bullet-proof vest.Even damaging scandals seem to have little effect. The Derek Mackay story wonrsquot fatally wound the party. Therersquos been much talk of the Mackay case spelling the beginning of the end for the SNP. It wonrsquot. Voters who want independence will take the shame and the scars and move on.However, the Mackay scandal will have negative political fall-out for the Yes movement. The great damage done is in the eyes of undecided voters and soft No voters, the swithering centre ground of the constitutional debate. The SNPrsquos increasingly alienating and uninspiring behaviour will deter those most needed to win independence. New voters wonrsquot be gained.Of course, the SNP is hammered in the Unionist press. But there are Nationalist journalists who make no bones of their bias too. One commentator said before the last election that theyrsquod not be making any criticism of the SNP until votes were cast and the party assured victory. It all feels a little incestuous on both sides. What we need is impartial debate for the good of the country.So the SNP gains from its controlling stake in the Yes movement, while the Yes movement is tarnished with the behaviour of the SNP. Thatrsquos the bottom line.This isnrsquot just a post-Mackay and pre-Salmond trial concern ndash this issue has been festering for years and rotting away inside the Scottish body politic.Reporting which holds the SNP Government to account is dismissed as an attempt to hamper the cause of independence. The net result  The SNP dodges proper accountability. If any other another party was in government, such scrutiny would be lauded for holding power to account. Thatrsquos no longer the case among a section of independence supporters. That wounds democracy.Perhaps, the best route out of this democratic dilemma is for an umbrella organisation like the old Yes Scotland to rise from the grave. We need to have a clear iding line between the SNP and the broader Yes movement.The SNP needs to be held to the same set of standards as other parties. It needs voted in and out of office according to its record. Itrsquos now becoming detrimental to good governance for the SNP to be able to continually hide behind independence.Similarly, a Yes movement set apart from the SNP machine, could represent independence without the issue being contaminated by party politics. This is in the best interests of Yes voters ndash of whom, Irsquom one.Why would I want an issue I believe in ndash in this case independence ndash made unnecessarily grubby by a political party  And why would I want the issue I believe in to be used as a shield by a political party ndash in this case the SNP ndash to prevent it being properly held to account Of course, the old Yes Scotland organisation, which shut up shop after the last independence referendum, had plenty of influential SNP members. But it was run by Blair Jenkins, a senior broadcaster not a politician, and Dennis Canavan, a former Labour MP who became an independent MSP.Yes Scotland didnrsquot feel asit were merely an adjunct to the SNP, intended to aid a party political machine. It felt like an organisation arguing for independence in a way that was best for the people of Scotland.This is why the debate around independence has become so toxic. All those old organisations which campaigned in , like Women for Independence or National Collective, represented ordinary folk making their voices heard. They did so mostly without bitterness or rancour.These citizensrsquo organisations operated by trying to win undecideds around with persuasion. Now that the debate around independence has been left to the career politicians itrsquos stagnated into ugliness ndash because thatrsquos what politics is: people are in it for power, money and ego. Thatrsquos not what the Yes movement was ever about, nor what Scotland needs.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11009892.jpg?type=article-full","title":"safer-internet-day---make-going-online-safe-simple-tips","story":"This is an International day celebrated in over  countries with the theme: Together for a better internet.

In ,  people died after a fire broke out in the trans-alpine road tunnel at Mont Blanc. This is seven miles long one under the Northern Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland would be three times longer.The biggest concern in establishing any Irish Sea link would be over Beauforts Dyke, which contains a million tons of munitions left over from World War Two together as well as two tons of radioactive waste dumped there in the s.But whether a Boris Tunnel or a Boris Bridge, the SNP branded the exercise a ldquovanity project.Nicola Sturgeon said her mind was not closed to the idea of a new Irish Sea link but the First Minister stressed: ldquoIf he has got poundbn to build such a bridge going spare at the moment, that could be spent on more important priorities.\"Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said: \"Its an outrageous proposal. I remain to be convinced its even possible.\"Labour peer, Andrew Adonis, the Governmentrsquos former infrastructure tzar, tweeted a reference to Mr Johnsonrsquos failed Garden Bridge project in the UK capital when he was London Mayor: ldquoSo now Boris wants to build a garden bridge all the way to Belfast. If you think HS has problems, multiply by  and ide the benefits by .The shipping industry also had qualms, suggesting a new Irish Sea link could threaten the livelihoods of ferry operators.A UK Chamber of Shipping spokesman said the industry supported any initiative to improve trade and tourism links.ldquoHowever, there are already a range of ferry operators taking tourists and trade between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Spending poundbn to poundbn of taxpayersrsquo money on a bridge simply to replicate what those ferries already do is unnecessary. The money could be far better spent improving road and rail links to our ports across the UK.Asked about the prospect of a Boris Bridge, the Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman pointed out how Mr Johnson had suggested the idea ldquocould have some merit, so people should expect the Government to be looking into it.Downing St officials have begun working with others across Whitehall in a ldquoscoping operation, the details of which would be presented to Mr Johnson to seethe scheme should proceed further.In  when the PM first broached the idea of a bridge across the Irish Sea, he said: ldquoThe problem is not the undersea Beauforts Dyke or lack of funds. The problem is an absence of political will.\"The spokesman said Mr Johnson was ldquoambitious about infrastructure projects and that a wide range of work was going on to improve connectivity across the UK and, what some have also dubbed the Union Bridge, was one example of it. ldquoA proper piece of work is being carried out into this idea, he explained.Bolstering the Union with infrastructure projects will also be a key theme of the HS announcement. While the go-ahead with be confirmed for the first phase London to Birmingham link, so too will be the second phase continuing it to Crewe and connecting it to West Coast Main Line, which will benefit passengers travelling to Glasgow and Edinburgh.Alongside this, Mr Johnson is expected to confirm funding for so-called Northern Powerhouse Rail, which will incorporate a ldquoCrossrail of the North, as part of his grand plan to ldquolevel up connectivity across the whole of the UK.In a Commons statement, the PM will announce bus services across England will be transformed with simpler fares, thousands of new buses, improved routes and higher frequencies.And he will tell MPs cycle routes will see a major boost with the construction of more than  miles of new, high-quality separated cycle routes south of the border.ldquoLocal transport connections have a truly transformative role to play in levelling up infrastructure across the country, declared Mr Johnson.Daily journeys for work or leisure were about so much more than just getting from A to B they were the key to accessing skilled jobs, boosting businesses and unlocking economic growth.ldquoThatrsquos why improving connectivity by overhauling bus services and making cycling easier than ever is such an important step forward, to make sure every community has the foundations it needs to thrive, he added.But Andy McDonald for Labour said: ldquoHS has been appallingly mismanaged by the Conservative Party, which has failed to deliver a single major infrastructure project on time or within budget.ldquoIf HS is going to get back on track, the project has to be integrated with Crossrail for the North, it needs to be managed as part of an advanced rail network, and it must eventually extend into Scotland so that we remove the need for domestic flights.The Shadow Transport Secretary stressed HS should be run under public ownership. ldquoThat way it is the UK public ndash not private or overseas state-owned companies ndash who will see aon this investment."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2-going-tories-existential-choice","story":"But it has also created a concern amongst some that there may be long-term damage inflicted on the SNP and the independence movement, with more problems than they are accustomed to simmering malevolently. Mackay. Salmond. Schools. Hospitals. Ferries.This is emphatically not a Government in trouble no party polling consistently above  per cent after  years in Government, and certain to emerge from the next election as the largest party, can credibly be said to be in trouble. But it is a Government enduring a period of policy and internal dficulties the likes of which it has not seen since it replaced Labour as ldquoScotlandrsquos party in .The Scottish Tories are hoping that dficulties turn into crisis, and crisis turns into defeat. They have a vision ndash a hope ndash that the Mackay story, next monthrsquos trial of Mr Salmond, and anything  which emerges now that the media has the scent of sleaze in its nostrils, could create a narrative which might just turn the tide against the SNP.One can be sure that nothing  will. Whilst some Tories see the perceived mounting doubt over the SNPrsquos domestic record as a route to power, most realise that it is nowhere near sufficient to eject them from office. If the SNP is to lose in Mayitrsquoll be a personality issue, not a policy one.What a backdrop for the Scottish Toriesrsquo new leader to take office on Valentinersquos Day, with the top task to avoid a Unionist massacre in just over  months. Barring an upset of Leicester City proportions, that new leader will be Jackson Carlaw.Mr Carlaw is a highly accomplished politician who has acquitted himself well in both of his caretaker stints. He is personable, excellent company in private, and his decency carries into the public sphere, where he treats opponents with a level of respect not entirely replicated across the Parliament. But he has a ruthless streak, as we saw at First Ministerrsquos Questions last Thursday when he went for the First Ministerrsquos jugular on Mr Mackay.He may need that ruthless streak. For he will enter what may quietly but suddenly become the most important year the Scottish Tory Party has had.For whilst the party may be attracted to a campaign based on the perceived policy failings of the SNP, in the real world, and in real politics, there is only one issue at the Holyrood  election, and that is indyref .The Toriesrsquo strategic positioning on a second independence referendum is highly likely to be the key determinant of its success at that election, which would be fine but for one thing they canrsquot agree amongst themselves on what it should be. Not only that, but the positions are becoming so entrenched that I think there is a decent chance agreement will not be found.There are, broadly, two camps letrsquos call them the Ayes and the Noes. They agree one one thing, that the top priority is to stop nationalist parties winning a Holyrood majority. But beyond that, they dfer.The Ayes accept thatthe SNPwin a majority on a clear manesto pledge to agitate for a second referendum, in an election in which everyone understands what they are voting for, then the referendum must be given.They see a persistent refusal to accept the verdict of the Scottish people as a continuation of the failed strategies of the past, whereby London thinks it is ldquowinning by saying no to the SNP, while it is in fact fomenting discord and pushing moderates towards nationalism, repelled by centralisation and a lack of respect for Scotland.More acutely, they see the ldquono to Indyref  strategy as a vote loser. This is counter-intuitive, but with perhaps  per cent of voters committed to voting Conservative, the party is depending on another -or-so per cent of Labour and LibDem-voting Unionists to vote Tory rather than staying put, staying at home, or voting SNP.To attract these people, they need the threat of Indyref  to be on the table. In Decemberrsquos General Election, these Unionists were reassured by Boris Johnsonrsquos guarantee that there would be no Indyref , and accordingly did not feel compelled to vote Tory to stop it. There was no threat, so there was no compulsion. Several MPs lost their seats as a direct consequence.So the Ayes believe that not only is accepting Indyref  after an SNP victory democratically right, it is also electorally smart.But then there are the Noes. The Noes are scarred by the ldquonear miss at the first independence referendum. Although not all accept how poor the  Downing Street campaign was, they know they donrsquot want to do it again. Some are opposed primarily out of a deep pessimism about their chances of winning, but the greater number oppose the concept of Indyref  for the more noble reason that they see the extensive rupture that the issue continues to cause in Scottish politics and in Scottish public le, and they fear a deepening of the ide.They also tend to see the SNP as a party on the way down, and eventually out. They believe thatthey hold firm and create a competent-looking alternative government, the SNP will eventually fizzle out and lose an election, after which the independence issue is dead.They also believe that the ldquono, never strategy gives the SNP more or a problem than it gives them. If the SNP wins a majority in  and the Prime Minister still says no, what is the First Minister to do  She could ldquodo a Catalonia, but everyone knows that she wonrsquot, because she will lose all the international respect and legitimacy which she has worked so hard to build.So, the Noes suppose, the SNP will simply dial up the grievance agenda and double-down on perpetually talking about Indyref . The people will tire, wonrsquot they The fascinating truth of this Tory dilemma is that both the Ayes and the Noes have credible points. Either could be right, in the final analysis.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt. HIE must be properly supported to continue their role in providing an alternative.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

December’s AE waiting times were the worst on record. The number of homelessness deaths in Scotland is rising sharply and the rate is the highest in the UK. Scotland’s schools are slipping down the international rankings and there is to be a full and extensive review of the SNP’s botched implementation of Curriculum for Excellence conducted by the OECD .Unfortunately, while there is so much at stake determining the future of our country, the Derek Mackay scandal has overshadowed much of Thursday’s important debate on the Budget statement. Derek Mackay’s actions are nothing short of predatory and everyone at Scottish Labour sends their support to the schoolboy involved, his family, and the family of Derek Mackay.:Derek Mackay scandal will not bring down SNP - Brian Monteith: SNP urged to ‘remove independence roadblock’ to get budget through HolyroodSuch heinous acts by a man in a position of power and privilege are entirely intolerable. It is right that Derek Mackay has resigned from the Cabinet and it is right that the SNP have removed the whip, but the nature of his actions mean he is not fit to hold public office – he should go and go now.The long-awaited Budget statement, as presented by Kate Forbes on Thursday afternoon, was deeply disappointing. Though not without some positives such as the Scottish Child Payment which I have called for many times, the statement clearly showed the SNP has no intention of breaking with the timidity of the last  years and delivering the investment Scotland badly needs.Yawning financial black holeThat the SNP intends to use its resource-borrowing powers to borrow £ million in order to plug the £ billion financial blackhole is deeply troubling. This is money that must be paid back and the SNP need to come clean with the parliament and the people of Scotland and explain exactly where they intend to make the cuts that would be needed to pay this money back. Throwing good money after bad in order to try to plug the yawning fiscal black hole is not only unworkable, but irresponsible. Scottish Labour is willing to work with the Government, but onlythey commit to free bus travel for under-s that will promote public transport usage and break down barriers to opportunity provide a fair deal for our hard-pressed local authorities and take decisive action in response to the climate crisis.So far, the indication is that the SNP will not commit to free bus travel for under-s nor provide further and higher education with the resources they need after years of under-investment.The Government’s proposals for local authority funding have received deservedly short shrt from councillors and Cosla, whose president, Alison Evison, has said that in reality this Budget means local government faces “a cut to services, a cut to local jobs, a cut to the work councils do to tackle child poverty and respond to climate change”.The Budget as proposed also makes for dire reading on the subject of higher education. After a decade of cuts and neglect, it offers nothing of any substance to Scotland’s universities. Students too, who are now burdened with record levels of debt, have little reason to celebrate this Budget. As the president of the National Union of Students Scotland, Liam McCabe, has said, “Despite the rising cost-of-living, the support on offer to Scotland’s students remains largely unchanged, leaving them increasingly out of pocket and many struggling to get by, especially the most disadvantaged.” Nicola Sturgeon once said “judge me on education”. Well, the NUS have judged her and her Government, and it’s failing marks for the SNP.Tories offer to back SNPThe alternatives to a Scottish Labour-backed budget are either unpalatable or unthinkable. The Scottish Green Party, who have dutully helped pass the last four Scottish Budgets, have rediscovered their environmental zeal and have decided that they cannot back a Budget that has failed to provide a coherent or strong response to the climate crisis and has been described as “… more timid tinkering at the edges” by Friends of the Earth Scotland.The Scottish Tories, who helped pass the SNP’s Budgets between  and , have offered to lend the SNP their support this time around, but on condition that the SNP legislate for lower taxes. The SNP have made it clear that they will not lower taxesand so this scenario, quite apart from the constitutional animus, looks unlikely. The Liberal Democrats have said they will under no circumstances support any Budget proposed by the SNP.The option the SNP has is this: will they join with the Tories in passing a harmful and damaging budget or will they work constructively with Scottish Labour  It doesn’t have to be like this. Over the coming weeks, Scottish Labour will be fighting for the change we want to see and making the case for our transformative policies to the Government. We have a chance to turn the page on years of under-investment and SNP smoke and mirrors. Scottish Labour will fight for our proposals with the courage of our convictions.Our NHS is in crisis, with social care on the brink. Our education system is failing school pupils and leaving students burdened with eye-watering levels of debt. Our planet is on the verge of ecological disaster. This Budget has so far entirely failed to meet the needs and demands of the day. It is high time the SNP had a long, hard look at the contrast between timidity of their proposals and the need for radical change that exists in our society. After  years of SNP mismanagement and timidity, it is time for investment and time for real change.Richard Leonard is the leader of Scottish Labour and an MSP for Central Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"derek mackay ex finance minister did not hand in resignation after texting boy 16","story":"Top SNP figurehead Mackay, , resigned last week after shocking messages were published showing he had pestered a schoolboy for six months on social media, including offering to take him to dinner and trying to meet up with him.: Derek Mackay scandal will not bring down SNP - Brian MonteithThe dad-of-two was said to have resigned verbally - but opposition parties raised concerns about transparency, with both Scottish Labour and the Tories criticising the lack of a paper trail.: Police Scotland speak with boy, , who SNP politician Derek Mackay bombarded with messagesIn  messages, published in the Scottish Sun, Renfrewshire North and West MSP called the boy \"cute\", asked him to dinner and asked that their conversations be kept secret.On Thursday morning Mackay resigned and a statement was issued saying: \"I spoke last night with the First Minister and tendered my resignation with immediate effect.\"Critics suggested that a lack of a written resignation would impede any attempt to review the situation in future.However a spokesman for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon refuted the suggestion a resignation letter was necessary.A spokesman for the First Minister said: \"The Scottish Government acted swtly, decisively and entirely appropriately when the details of this issue came to light.\"Derek Mackay is no longer a minister, and his resignation took effect immediately on it being offered.\"There is no requirement for a letter.\"But Tory MSP Donald Cameron said: \"The SNP Government has form for covering things up and refusing to reveal paper trails.\"But on this most serious of matters, the public will expect full transparency.\"It is astonishing theres no letter submitting the resignation, nor one accepting it.\"Its high time Nicola Sturgeon adopted a more open and accountable approach to this scandal.\"A Scottish Labour spokesman added: \"The lack of a formal resignation letter raises signicant concerns over transparency and would impede any attempt to review the nature of the resignation in the future.\"It seems that the Government is more interested in keeping the public in the dark over this very serious matter than allowing for proper scrutiny.\"A Government source told the Herald it was merely \"custom\" for there to be an exchange of letters, and there was no requirement for a Cabinet Secretary to write one or the First Minister to reply.Mr Mackay has been suspended by the SNP, which is now investigating his conduct.Police Scotland has also spoken to the boy and an older SNP activist pursued by Mr Mackay. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"hs2 snp call for scottish investment amid spiralling costs of project","story":"The Prime Minister told the Commons that the full HS project, which could cost as much as £bn, although the sections beyond Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds will be reviewed in a bid to cut the bill.: Scottish high-speed rail could mean Edinburgh to Newcastle in  minutes ndash Alastair DaltonMr Johnson said he would appoint a minister to oversee HS delivery in a cabinet reshuffle confirmed for Thursday.\"If we start now, services could be running by the end of the decade, he said.\"So today the Cabinet has given High Speed Rail the green signal.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

The line will be open from am – pm Monday to Friday.The contact line is for use by three priority vehicle groups which include four year old cars due their first MOT, taxis and car dealerships. These groups are unable to avail of a Temporary Exemption Certicate being issued to other car and light goods vehicle owners.Speaking as the contact line opens, DVA Chief Executive Paul Duffy said: “DVA is continuing to work to contact priority vehicle owners as quickly as possible, however we do not have contact details for all of these customers.“We are therefore asking anyone with a four year old car due its first MOT, taxis and local car dealerships with vehicles due a test within the next two weeks to contact us on  , so we can move your appointment forward. Please state clearly when the vehicle test is due and have your booking reference to hand. This line will continue to be open to all relevant customers within the priority groups who need an urgent appointment within two weeks from the time of the call. “DVA can only bring an appointment forward after a booking has been made on the system, so it is essential that customers continue to make a booking when they get a reminder letter.”DVA continues to do everything possible to resume normal operations and two new vehicle lts are now in operation in Belfast and Newbuildings, increasing capacity at these sites. Three existing lts in Belfast and Lisburn have been independently inspected and are back in operational use. Two independent reviews announced by the Minister for Infrastructure have also now begun and an initial report in relation to the status of existing vehicle lts and any repair work necessary is due shortly. DVA would like to remind owners of cars of five years and older whose tests have been cancelled by the DVA, that they will automatically receive a Temporary Exemption Certicate , thereby enabling them to continue to drive and tax their vehicle.TECs are also being automatically issued to owners of three year old light goods vehicles. Testing of heavy goods vehicles, buses, motorcycles and re-tests remains unaffected by the current disruption and those customers should continue to attend appointments.Customers should continue to book an MOT when they get their reminder letter. This will ensure that, should DVA need to cancel the test later, a temporary exemption certicate can be issued automatically.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

The most recent Performance Improvement Report, issued in November, indicates that the Council has not performed to the standards expected or addressed the serious issues confronting it. Information from the Northern Ireland Audit Office has confirmed Causeway Coast and Glens is performing well below the other  councils.“This cannot be ignored by elected representatives and this is why we called for the appointment of independent consultants to examine root and branch the senior workings of this council.They continued: “As elected representatives, we are required to adhere to a code of conduct based on the  principles of public le. Principally, we are servants of the public and stewards of public resources.We have a moral responsibility to our constituents to take control of the situation, to correct it and to ensure that it does not happen again. We also have an obligation to demand openness and transparency.The SDLP group concluded: “The harsh reality is that this Council is at financial breaking point and is quickly losing the trust ofthe public. This huge debt is seen by an increasing number of people as poor management and we need to recty that.“We are delighted that our motion was passed to call in independent experts to meticulously detail what the problems are and more importantly, what the long-term solutions are. Only then will it be able to regain the public’s confidence”.A motion, proposed by Sinn Feacutein Councillor Cara McShane on the appointment of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancyinto Causeway Coast and Glens was also passed on Tuesday.The council agreed to appoint CIPFA and to defer any decision on rates ahead of the legal timeframe of  February.They said this was to allow CIPFA to make recommendations, report to members and work with council to prepare a medium term financial plan and financial resilience review. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a great era.You had to go out that was the only way to meet up, you couldnt bring a girl round to the house.Youd have to go to the pictures or go for a walk.The smitten couple went to great s to see each other because Mr Boyle lived in Lishally while his sweetheart was from the city.We walked everywhere so we used to go out with our dancing shoes under our arm, said Mrs Boyle.Very few people had cars and a night out could involve all manner of transport, especiallyyou were going to Borderland in Muff.Myra got the bus to Enagh Lough and I would walk her in to the Red Cross Bar and then we would get the boat across from Lisahally to Culmore and then walk from Culmore out to Borderland, said Mr Boyle. googletag.cmd.push Jimrefused to let living out in Lisahally get in the way of his social le.I used to stick my galoshes [waterproof shoes] in a hedge and pick them up on the way home, he recalled.I got a lt on a motorbike a few times and I went on the back of lorries with pigs in them.It could be scary walking down the Lough Road at night because it was pitch black.I used to say youll never see anybody as long as you walk backwards.You had to know every street in Derry too.Becauseyou offered to walk a girl home you had to know how far it was going to be.The Derry girls were well known for their sense of style and were always impeccably dressed.They were always very well turned out, said Mr Boyle.The Derry ladies were always dressed up.Especially at the Embassy. Even the bouncers at the Embassy wore a tabby bow.Thats the only thing that has changed is the dress, said Mr Boyle.In those days you wouldnt have got in without a collar and a tie.You had to get all dressed up and the bands would be all dressed up too.There was no turning up in jeans and a oul top.You used to see the girls walking around on a Friday with their curlers in.Sometimesthey asked you out they would say no, Im washing my hair.That was a handy way of refusing.Dancing was a big thing for people of all ages in the city and most of them were self taught.You might have had an older sister who would show you the steps, or you would teach yourself pushing off a door handle, said Mr Boyle.Mr and Mrs Boyle both recall the excuse me dances where someone could cut in and take your partner.It was mostly your mates who would cut in, Jim recalled.You had to rescind to them and give them your lady friend.There were strict rules about the style of dancing too and how close you could get to your partner.You werent allowed to jive unless it was a jive session, and you couldnt dance too close to your partner, said Mrs Boyle.The parish priest would come along and tap you on the shoulderhe thought you were too close, whether you were married or not.A girl could get a tap too. I remember getting one at the Whitehorse when we were married.And the couple, who have been wed for  years, have no intention of hanging up their dancing shoes any time yet.We cant stop now we would seize up, joked Mrs Boyle.Its much better than sitting in the house, agreed Mr Boyle. The doctor should put it on prescription, dancing gets you out and exercising and talking to people. googletag.cmd.push If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the second half we werent clinical enough. We should have been finishing that game with -, - at our ease. googletag.cmd.push “We played much better last week than we did this week. Its old school tradition but I felt we didnt get enough blocks on last week, we didnt put enough pressure on the ball going in and today we did that much better and thats probably resulted in Tipp being held scoreless from play.”Gallagher admitted that the uncertainty in the build up to the game was not at all helpful, with the Derry boss expecting the game to be postponed after witnessing the rain at Celtic Park on Saturday night.“In the morning we probably felt that it wasnt going to be on,” he said. “It was a bit of a lottery and you could see the way it cut up there. To be brutally honest I stayed up last night and witnessed the rain. “We were up at the Brunswick and the kids were coming out and it was absolutely baltic and the rain was coming in.“In fairness the pitch improved and to be fair thats part of the challenge of being a sportsman or athlete because you have got to be mentally strong and to be fair the lads started the game strong and that didnt seem to impact them.”Yesterdays game was certainly not the most entertaining nor memorable of games, but for Gallagher and his players it was all about the result.“When it was -, - you would like to have seen us push on but to be honest I thought there were one or two soft frees again,” he continued. “We didnt push on but we overplayed the ball and dropped a couple short and maybe Alex had a couple of shots we missed and we had Sammysgoal chance and we had Dannyschance.“Those things, maybe instead of stretching the game out to -, or  or  points maybe leaves it a wee bit more nervy than it should but I suppose the boys are saying that we havent beaten a team ranked like Tipperary in a couple of years so it probably leads to a wee bit of fear.” googletag.cmd.push Important After disappointments of ious natures against Leitrim and Down, yesterdays win was important for Derry in the short term as well as in the bigger picture.“We need to have an open mind,” Gallagher continued. “We want to be better at the end of the league than we were at the start. Thats the approach we have taken because we are with a new group and we are trying to build a consistency here.“Im not from Derry but looking in from the outside the turnover in players, the in and out of the squad, the lack of consistency in selection, the lack of togetherness probably, were really trying to build on that.“We think the age of the squad is really, really good there and we know theres good talent thats come through in Derry but its a matter now of sticking together. Its a test of character and generally the people who are mentally toughest and the strongest characters win out.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Leo Doherty, an Upper-Sixth pupil at Lumen Christi College, has won first prize in the Intermediate Category of the British Council’s Mandarin Speaking Competition, which was held at the Victory Service Club last Wednesday. His win follows on from that of Thornhill Colleges Eve Flood, who took the beginners’ title last year. The competition aims to build interest in Chinese language and culture and saw Leo joined by students from  Secondary Schools from across the Britain – including fellow pupilsAnitta Sibin, who competed in the Beginners’ Category, andMatthew Rodgers, Niamh Fleming, Grace Martin, Vibhav Nthanankalva and Owen McFadden, who performed in the Group category. googletag.cmd.push The Lumen Christi pupils made it through to the final after competing in the Northern Ireland heat last November which was supported by the Confucius Institute at Ulster University. Leo, who has only been learning Mandarin for two years, said it was surreal to have won. “I’ve always loved linguistics and with Mandarin, it changes the way you think about languages – it’s almost like a problem to be solved. I also like that you can watch dferent TV, listen to Chinese music and communicate with people across the world. “I was shocked when I won. There were so many good competitors and I didn’t expect to come away with anything. I was just there for the experience, and it wasn’t really about the winning so to speak –it still feels very surreal. googletag.cmd.push “My teacher XU Honge helped me prepare - giving me lots of tips and tricks ahead of the competition as well as showing me how to manipulate the language. It was definitely a lot more work than I originally thought, but well worth it!” He now plans to study Maths at either Cambridge University or St Andrew’s. “At university I plan to study Maths as it’s just something I enjoy and hopefully it will take me into some job I like. I aim to keep learning Mandarin as I think it will be useful – you see jobs in London, Dublin and even Derry where they need people that can speak Mandarin and communicate with people in China.” Dr Marie Ferris, Vice Principal at Lumen Christi Collegesaid: “We’re just so tremendously proud of Leo, as well as the rest of our finalists. It’s a great achievement for all of them – they were very professional and performed at such a high level, especially considering the competition they had to face. “I must pay tribute to their Mandarin teachers from the Confucius Institute, who have worked so hard with them. As a school, we have been part of the Confucius project since  and it’s created so many opportunities for our pupils, helping them learn more about Chinese language and culture.” As the most spoken language in the world, Mandarin is recognised as a valuable skill for young people in the UK to acquire.  per cent of British business leaders surveyed in  said that speaking Mandarin will give school leavers a career advantage. Research by the British Council has found that Mandarin is the second most important foreign language for the UK’s influence on the global stage.Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland commended Leos achievement. He said: “Congratulations to Leo on such a fantastic achievement, which is testament to the hard work he and his teachers have put in throughout the past year. We hope that Leo is an inspiration to other students to think about learning Mandarin or finding out more about Chinese language and culture. “Language learning is an essential part of understanding and collaborating with other countries and cultures. With more than one billion Mandarin speakers in the world, it’s important that more young people in the UK learn the language – those that do will find it opens up exciting study and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world. “In the British Council we have a wide range of opportunities and resources available to support schools who are keen to get more involved in international work and would encourage other schools to get in touch with us to see how we can support their international ambitions.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The ballot was ided into three sections, UK, Devolved and Local.In South Down, .% of over , young respondents said that protecting the environment was the most important UK issue, with almost % in favour of lowering the voting age to .Other key issues were tackling hate crime , welcoming refugeesand making UN Convention Rights of the Child law .Under devolved issues, .% of young people said mental health was the most important issue when compared to child poverty , ending kne crime , curriculum for leand stopping street harassment .Over , young people responded to this part of the ballot and % of responses were environmental issues mdash ranging from dealing with erosion at Ballyhornan to improving school eco-councils to introducing more recycling points.Overall, the top five biggest inidual local issues were stopping the amalgamation of St Patrickrsquos Grammar with St Maryrsquos and De La Salle High Schools in Downpatrick . Other local issues highlighted included tackling litter , mental health , drug misuseand protecting the local environment .

He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child. We share that we are united by angels, which is our motto.John said that there are now over  men who have joined the club and he and Pat hope to welcome more throughout the year.The first match will be held at Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch on Friday, February  at pm.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10940577.jpg","title":"bandstand paddy mulligan","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
